Essay 1:
	We can broadly categorise people into two main segments: the first segment of people are comfortable with living in the same place, eating the same types of food, having a career that involves pretty much doing the same thing and taking almost no risks, while others are completely the opposite who find the meaning of life through risks and challenges and are not afraid of trying new things. Personally, I like to take risks, face challenges and enjoy the diversity of the world through travelling and favour the second group of people.
	People who avoid challenges or scarcely try new things are comfortable with the lifestyle they already have. They do not want to make life complicated by taking on new challenges that might bring misery or dissatisfaction to their life. Such people are often contended with whatever they have and wish to stay in their comfort zone. Since they are afraid of failure, their success is also limited. We can see many people around us who fall in this category, who, despite seeing potential in a new career, never dare to change their existing job or even detest the idea of trying new food.
	On the other hand, there are people who believe that change is constant and that taking on challenges is something that makes life thrilling and enjoyable. They embrace new ideas, travel to difficult places, try new food, experience diversity of life and culture, and get easily bored doing the same thing for a long. These people take risks that bring success. But such success is not always guaranteed as failure can also befall them. I also know such people, and I consider myself one of them. They are often the trailblazer and inventors, builders and creators of new things and ideas. For instance, despite having a good job in a multinational company, one of my cousins started a boutique business. No one initially supported his move, but now he is so successful that many others cite him as an example of success.
	In conclusion, being in the comfort zone, doing familiar things and taking minimal risks may guarantee comfort and stability in life but real success and great inventions and ideas come from taking risks and embracing challenges. I am always in favour of the second type of attitude that makes life worth living.
Essay 2:
	Some people always yearn for new experiences in life and are never afraid to try new things. Others, on the contrary,  are happy doing the same thing and living in the same place all through their life primarily because they do not like changes. This essay will discuss both these attitudes. Personally, I believe that people who embrace changes and dare to try new things live life to the fullest.
	People who try new things are often risk-takers and adventure seekers. They believe that life is a constant journey, and they often have an unquenchable thirst to visit as many places as they can, try as many dishes as they come across, take part in numerous adventurous activities and try different career paths in their life. Such people take risks in their personal and professional life. This is why they are either hugely successful or live a nomadic life. For instance, one of my university friends started travelling when all others were busy looking for a job. Due to this, he was struggling financially while others were stable in their jobs and earnings. However, after ten years of our graduation, this friend, who is also a famous travel blogger on YouTube and an investigative journalist, earns at least 10 times higher than any of us. This success is not always assured but comes to those who embrace non-traditional life and try new things.
	On the other hand, many people are just happy doing the same thing over and over again and trying the things they are already familiar with. This approach involves fewer risks but often lacks big rewards and experience in life. Due to this mentality, many people are not interested in moving to a different city or trying a new career path despite their potential of doing something greater and bigger. Interestingly, many people who are afraid to take risks or try new things often claim to live a less complicated life. But I believe that this is not a way to live life to the fullest as it lacks adventure and never brings out our true potential in life. 
	To conclude, doing the same things and living in the same place come with little risk, but lack adventure and tremendous rewards. Contrary to this, taking challenges and embracing new things come with enormous risks but the rewards are also huge.
Essay 3:
	Attempting new activities and breaking habits, such as visiting new places, pursuing a new hobby, and trying new types of food, can be a thrilling and enriching experience for some people while quite daunting for others who prefer to stick with familiar activities and familiar choices. Both attitudes have their own benefits and demerits, and ultimately, it is a matter of personal preference. In this essay, I will be discussing both these attitudes, but personally, I prefer taking challenges and trying new things often.
	Those who are not afraid of taking challenges and trying novel things can gain new experiences and enjoy rapid personal growth. They argue that experiencing new cultures, places, and foods, as well as pursuing new hobbies or tasks can broaden one's perspective and help one lead a more fulfilling life. I also have this mindset as I believe that trying new things can be an exciting and enriching experience. For example, I recently visited a new country for the first time and it was an amazing experience. I was able to learn about a new culture and try new foods that I had never had before. It was a truly enriching experience and I felt like I had grown as a person from it.
	The second perspective is to maintain familiar activities and choices. People with this attitude feel comfortable and secure in sticking to what they already do and know. They believe that sticking to the familiar can lead to a sense of predictability and stability in life. I can see where they are coming from because there is definitely comfort in the familiar. For example, someone who always eats the same food and never tries new dishes may miss out on new experiences and flavours but also does not regret trying something that is so peculiar that it leaves a bad feeling the whole day.
	To conclude, trying new things can lead to new understandings and personal growth while maintaining the accustomed routine can lead to a sense of predictability and stability. Since I love challenges and trying new things, I think it is good to try something new and break our habits for future growth and a fulfilling life.

Essay 4:
	It is irrefutable that plastic harms the environment to a great extent. Plastic pollutes lands and water, degrades the fertility of the soil, and harms animals disrupting the entire ecosystem. Recycling plastic and limiting its use while also introducing biodegradable alternatives to plastics are by far the most effective solutions to this problem.
	The environmental damages caused by plastic are severe and often extreme. Plastic bags, bottles, packages, toys and many other materials made of plastic remain in land and water for hundreds of years as they are not biodegradable. Plastic materials, that get mixed with soil, impair the breathability of soil and hamper the water flow in it. Thus it hurts the fertility of the land. Moreover, plastic that reaches the water bodies harms aquatic animals and coral reefs. Plastic pollution plays a considerable part in animal deaths. Today, plastic particles could be found in fishes, birds and other animals, and it disrupts the entire ecosystem.
	However, the authorities concerned and mass people can turn the tide and mend the damage done to the environment to a great extent. For that, they have to ensure that they both play their part efficiently. First, people have to spontaneously take part in the plastic recycling process by putting plastic waste in a separate recycle bin. The authority has to make sure that all recyclable plastics are properly recycled and reused. To limit the use of plastic bags, people need to use bags made of biodegradable materials like jute fibre. They can start carrying their own glass-made bottle instead of buying plastic water bottles. Reduction in consumption of plastic-made materials could contribute to a large extent in limiting the harms caused by plastic. Finally, the government can limit the use of plastic bags and bottles by imposing a hefty tax on such items.
	In conclusion, plastic is severely detrimental to the environment and ecosystem. So for our own benefit, we all need to use as less plastic as possible while also recycling the used plastic.
Essay 5:
	Plastic products are affordable, versatile and durable, but they are a threat to our environment. They pollute soil and water, endanger animals and act as a breeding ground for deadly insects. The authority and general people can take numerous measures to curb the problem and its magnitude.
	Plastics can severely harm our environment. The littering of plastics creates a rather unhygienic condition here and there. These unsanitary conditions then become the breeding ground for harmful insects and mosquitoes, causing diseases like malaria and dengue. According to United Nations Environmental Programme, we produce nearly 400 million tons of plastic waste each year. Such a large volume of plastic waste can harm our environment to a large extent, especially, when these plastic products take from decades to centuries to decompose. They seriously degrade soil fertility or quality, meaning plants or trees can not grow well on those soils. Moreover, plastic items can seriously pollute water bodies too, by changing their original chemical property, since they easily can find their way into the rivers and oceans. And when that happens, it poses a grave threat to fish and other marine lives. There have been instances where some large endangered species of tortoises were found to be suffocating because of mistakenly swallowing plastic bags that were attached to seaweed.
	To limit these environmental damages, governments and individuals, around the world, can take some effective initiatives. People can recycle some of the plastic products they use, and reduce their reliance on plastics. For instance, many people use glass-made bottles to carry water rather than using one-time-use plastic water bottles. But it definitely should be the governments that need to do the heavy lifting, in this case, to protect our environment from plastic waste by enacting different kinds of rules and regulations wherever deem appropriate and also continually running awareness programmes. For example, South Africa has restricted the manufacture and usage of plastic bags by enacting parliamentary legislation. Besides, governments can also offer tax incentives for those individuals or companies who do not use plastic products.
	In conclusion, plastic is an imminent threat to our world, and if we - both the government and individuals - work hand in hand, then the chances are one day, we would be able to see a world where plastic is not a problem anymore.
Essay 6:
	Plastic is used extensively because it is cheap and convenient, but it has severe environmental impacts. Plastic is not biodegradable, and the damage caused to the environment, especially to farmlands, oceans and marine life due to our love for plastic, is profound and should be stopped immediately. In this essay, I will outline the harms plastic causes to the environment and explore what could be done by governments and individuals to solve this problem.
	The damages that plastic causes to the mother planet are significant and irreversible. Plastic bags, cutleries, bottles, and packaging are not biodegradable, and they take thousands of years to decompose. This means that once we discard plastic-made goods, they will remain in the environment for an extensive amount of time. It severely degrades the fertility of farming lands all around the world. Moreover, plastic that finds its way into the body of water or oceans can be particularly harmful, as it can entangle and suffocate animals living there. Plastic, that reaches the water, can also be ingested by animals and fishes there, causing injury or death to these species. According to the Natural Environment data, approximately a hundred thousand sea turtles and other marine animals die each year because they get entangled in plastic items.
	To solve the problems caused by plastics, authorities and individuals need to take immediate action. First, governments, all around the world, can impose strict environmental laws, such as banning the use of plastic bags and promoting the use of biodegradable and renewable resources without delay. They can also impose hefty taxes on plastic products to discourage their use and manufacturing. Additionally, governments can organize numerous environmental awareness campaigns and programmes to educate the general public about the dangers of plastic and the benefits of using biodegradable and renewable alternatives.
	The general public can also make a difference by reducing their use of plastic bags, bottles, and packaging which will have a huge positive impact in curbing the detrimental effects of plastics. They can do this by using reusable bags made of jute or clothes, glass bottles and containers, and by choosing to use products that have almost no packaging requirements. Additionally, mass people can support businesses that use sustainable packaging, which can help keep millions of tons of plastic materials out of landfills every year.
	In conclusion, without a doubt, plastic is bad for the environment as it causes significant damage to our mother planet. We need to act now to stop the spread of plastic towards making a world free of plastic contamination and help the planet, especially ocean, retain its biodiversity.

Essay 7:
	With the rapid technological development, driverless vehicles are becoming a reality, and within a couple of decades, all cars will run without the intervention of a human driver. I personally believe that driverless cars will bring far more benefits than the possible drawbacks they have.
	To begin with the drawbacks, driverless cars pose some risks, including accidents and casualties, should the technology malfunction. Since the vehicles would be run and controlled by software and technology, the risk of devastating accidents due to bugs or hacking could not be eliminated. It will make us more susceptible to hackers and software glitches. An accident, in which a woman died, caused by a driverless car while still in beta mode, caused a great uproar a few years ago. Moreover, not all roads, especially those in poor nations with ditches, holes and insufficient road signals, are suitable for those automated cars to run smoothly.
	However, technology-made mistakes are astronomically fewer than man-made blunders when it comes to road safety and casualties, and this is where driverless automobiles can make a significant improvement. Though we point out a single accident made by a driverless car, human drivers are responsible for hundreds, if not thousands, of casualties each day all around the world. With the introduction of automated cars, accidents would reduce remarkably making roads safer for all. On top of that, millions of hours could be saved each day since we would no longer need to sit behind the wheel. It will increase our productivity and boost the national economy. 
	In conclusion, driverless vehicles have many great benefits including road safety and economic benefits, and it is expected that we could eliminate the software related issues to reap the maximum benefits of this marvellous technology.
Essay 8:
	Driverless cars, thanks to the phenomenal development of technology, are no longer fiction, but a reality, and it is expected that most vehicles will be autonomous in the future. Despite both benefits and demerits, the writer of this essay does think that the advantages of driverless vehicles do not outweigh the disadvantages. 
	One of the major advantages of driverless vehicles is that they reduce the number of accidents on the road. Such cars provide better traffic efficiency since the driverless vehicles can travel efficiently at an optimized and safe distance from each other by communicating among themselves in real-time, on the road, and by telling which routes to take. It reduces accidents and casualties to a great extent.
	However, the systems or the technologies, used to operate driverless vehicles, can malfunction or stop working at any time, without any prior notice. And, if that happens, an autonomous vehicle could actually put the passengers in more danger than if a human driver was driving it. Besides, self-driving cars lack the ability to make judgments among multiple unfavourable scenarios and outcomes. For example, let’s say that a self-driving car had to face a situation with only two possible options: one is to veer to the left and strike a pedestrian, and the other one is to turn to the right and hit a tree, potentially injuring the passengers inside the vehicle. Now, since both options are undesirable, which option would the driverless car choose? The Moral Machine, developed by a group at MIT in the USA, is seeking to address this critical issue by collecting data on real-life people’s decisions, but the data collected, so far, shows broad differences amongst different groups of people, making it very difficult to programme any definitive answer for autonomous cars. Thus autonomous cars are good to have but are not great to ride in!
	So, based on the discussion above, we can fairly conclude that the shortcomings of driverless automobiles outweigh their possible benefits.
Essay 9:
	The concept that all cars will be driverless has been gaining traction lately as advancements in technology have made it increasingly feasible and demonstrations have already been successful. The idea of a future where only passengers occupy such vehicles is one that has both benefits and drawbacks. However, in my opinion, the benefits of driverless vehicles outweigh the potential disadvantages.
	One of the main drawbacks of driverless cars is the potential loss of jobs for millions of drivers. This is particularly concerning in industries, such as trucking, taxi service and ride-sharing, where driving is the primary occupation. Another major shortcoming of fully automated vehicles is the potential for hackers to gain control of the vehicle and cause mayhem. This could be a significant security concern, as the technology is still in its infancy, and vulnerabilities may not yet have been identified.
	On the other hand, several major advantages of driverless vehicles make them an attractive option for the future. To begin with, driverless automobiles are expected to remarkably reduce the number of road accidents caused by human error, as the vehicles are controlled by advanced software and sensors that are less prone to mistakes. Additionally, automated vehicles have the potential to improve traffic flow and reduce congestion, as they can communicate with one another and adapt to changing traffic conditions in real-time. Furthermore, driverless vehicles could also have positive impacts on the environment as they will reduce fuel consumption and emissions, for example.
	In conclusion, while there could be some disadvantages to the notion of driverless conveyances, the advantages of such vehicles far outweigh the drawbacks. The fewer road accidents, improved traffic conditions, and environmental benefits that driverless vehicles will bring us, make them an appealing choice for the future.

Essay 10:
	Sugar is undoubtedly one of the most harmful food ingredients when consumed more than recommended potion - which is often the case in our daily diet. To reduce the sugar-rich food and drinks intake, many recommend making them more expensive, and I believe that such sugar-packed products should be expensive to promote public health.
	Despite the common myth of the health benefits of sugar, scientists and nutritionists suggest that they are addictive, and are slow poison. Fast foods and sugary foods and drinks like soft drinks, desserts, ice-creams, and sodas come cheap and are ready to be consumed without any effort. This is why they have become so popular, and from children to the elderly, everyone loves those sugary foods and drinks. But these are known to cause serious diseases like diabetes and heart diseases and are connected to obesity. Since they are linked to so many unexpected health diseases and deaths, the authority should impose taxes, directly and indirectly, on those sugary items to make them unaffordable by mass people and in the process improve public health.
	Moreover, people often opt for food and drinks that are cheap and easily available. And if we only look at the departmental stores around us, we can notice that we have sugary items all around us, and they are affordable. So to restrict sugar intake, their prices should be increased via direct and indirect taxes. If they are made more expensive, people will reduce their consumption and go for more healthy alternatives. For instance, if a healthy meal costs $5 while a sugary junk meal $10, most people will go for the cheaper and better option. It will gradually but surely improve public health and reduce medical care expenses both for the government and ordinary citizens.
	To conclude, imposing higher taxes on sugary items will bring about many benefits and reduce the cost of healthcare. It is therefore expected that the authority will take steps to make sugar-packed items expensive.
Essay 11:
	Sugary foods and drinks are detrimental to health, so many suggest increasing their price to dissuade many people from purchasing and intaking them. But, I will have to disagree with this opinion. This essay explains the reasons behind my opinion.
	To begin with, even if the authority suddenly increases the prices of all sugary products, we will still notice that many people are still buying those products as usual. They will be buying them either because they are just too much “addicted” to those sugary products, or a high price does not really curtail their abilities to buy such expensive products. It will, however, negatively affect the prices of the necessary food items, and poor people will suffer to a great extent because it is not only “sugar” that is needed to make sugary products, but rather several other raw materials, such as flour, milk, egg, oil and etc. And that means that if the governments want to increase the price of sugary products, they will not only have to impose a higher tax exclusively on sugar but also on the other raw materials. 
	Another problem with taking such a decision is that some manufacturers of these sugary products would still try to sell them illegally to their existing customers at a lower price, through some “back channels” or secretly, in order to keep their businesses, because a higher price of their products would almost inevitably push many of their regular customers away from buying their products. 
	In conclusion, we need to run awareness campaigns to inform people about the negative aspects of eating and drinking sugary items. When they are made aware, it will bring positive results while price hikes on sugary items would make things only worse.
Essay 12:
	It is no secret that most processed foods and drinks contain excessive amounts of sugar, and this causes several health problems while also contributing to the growing obesity epidemic in many countries. In light of this, many argue that sugary products should be made more expensive in order to discourage consumption and encourage healthier alternatives. I completely agree with this viewpoint. 
	One of the main reasons for the excessive consumption of sugary products and drinks is their low cost. Therefore, increasing the price of sugary products would be a proven method of reducing their overall consumption. A recent study conducted by the World Health Organization reveals that a 20% price increase in sugary drinks resulted in as much as a 15% decrease in their consumption in just six months. It is very logical that, when sugary products will be expensive, many people will be less likely to indulge in them as frequently, and will instead opt for healthier alternatives. This will be particularly beneficial for low-income individuals, who are disproportionately affected by obesity and related health problems due to their reliance on cheap, unhealthy food.
	In addition, increasing the price of sugary products and imposing higher taxes on manufacturers of such products, can also serve as a deterrent for them to include excessive amounts of sugar in their products. This way, sellers will be incentivized to reduce the amount of sugar in their products in order to remain competitive in the market and make a profit.
	In conclusion, increasing the cost of sugary products is an effective method of reducing sugar consumption and promoting healthier eating habits. It would not only discourage the excessive consumption of these products but also make healthier options more accessible and affordable for all.
Essay 13:
	Processed food and most bottled drinks are packed with an excessive amount of sugar. Over-consumption of sugar is related to many deadly diseases and obesity, and this is why, many suggest that if those sugary products are made expensive, people, especially those with limited purchasing capacity, would consume less sugar and opt for healthy alternatives. I wholeheartedly disagree with this idea as I believe that this approach is not effective in curbing sugar intake.
	It is somewhat true that many people, especially low-income groups, will not have sufficient means to buy sweet foods and drinks with high sugar levels when they are made expensive. Different research work suggests that when the authority increases the price of sugary products, mass people decrease their sugar intake proportionately.
	However, people do not consume sugary products only because they are cheap. Rather, they love those sugary foods and drinks because they find them tasty, satisfying and addictive. This is perhaps the reason many people in my country enjoy a bottle of soda more than they would enjoy a glass of fresh juice without any sugar in it. Furthermore, increasing the price of sugary items may lead to a situation where low-income people would opt for even lower-quality options. I believe that raising the price of sweet items in the market does not address the root cause of the issue because for many individuals sweet products are integrated with their eating habits. Some eat them as rewards, others as a coping mechanism for stress and depression.
	In conclusion, increasing the price of sugary food for the betterment of public health may seem like a great option on the surface, but it is not impactful. A more effective way would be to educate people and promote healthier food to combat the negative trends of consuming excessive sugary foods and drinks.

Essay 14:
	Businesses often have to endure the cut-throat competition in order to attract customers and increase sales and profit. As a means to attract more customers, they have a tool called "advertisement" which emphasises how their products stand out from the crowd and how uniquely novel they are. I believe advertising new and unique features of a product is a marketing and branding strategy to boost sales, and in my opinion, it is mostly a negative development.
	Every brand claims that they have the best product in the market, and their goods have fascinating new features. They do so to create a positive impression to the consumers to increase their sales and profitability while also staying ahead of their competitors. Take the advertisements that we watch on TV for consumer products like shampoo, soaps or body lotion - all of which proclaim that their products have the best ingredients and something new that their counterparts do not have. Even they beat their old versions by adding a new vitamin or flavour (which is often ridiculed by scientists) and claiming that this is the best ever product! Clearly, this is a marketing strategy to boost sales and profitability while also creating a craving among the consumers for their products.
	It is mostly a negative trend because the new features that the businesses advertise are nothing novel in the true sense. They are just another version of the same product with a change in look, flavour or ingredients. It is true that industries like car manufacturers and electronic device manufacturers sometimes do extensive research to revamp their products and truly add new features for their customers. But most often consumer products and even the famous hardware brands add more creativity to their advertisements than the real products, thus making a false sense that people need their new products.
	In conclusion, novelty and innovation in products come through research and development, not through marketing and advertising tricks - which is often the case in the adverts we are exposed to. It is expected that advertisements by brands would reflect the true features of goods rather than claiming something new and innovative every now and then.
Essay 15:
	Brands often promote their products as innovative and novel. They primarily do so to attract more customers and increase their sales. In my opinion, any effort, on the part of businesses, to describe their products or services in a new light should be considered a positive thing because, without such practices, we would not be able to know about many of the necessary products and services that we use today. 
	The obvious reason for this trend is that all businesses want to boost their sales and revenues. But, unfortunately, increasing sales and revenues is not always as easy as it may sound, especially, when they are operating in a very fiercely competitive market. And that is exactly why they need to employ innovative advertising ideas and business strategies to show their prospective customers that their products indeed are “something new” and offer better values for the prices they pay. 
	Such “tactics” is also a positive development and indeed needed because it helps businesses and companies reach and attract a larger customer base from different lifestyles, cultural backgrounds, professions, ages, races and religions. In other words, we all are different, with different tastes and preferences, and therefore it is only natural that the businesses would want to target each group of these customers with different and unique messages in order to showcase and identify their products as something “new”. Moreover, such strategies employed by businesses bring positive results to many consumers because, the majority of the customers today, if not all, expect more out of their life. In other words, they do not necessarily like to remain satisfied with the same kinds of products that offer the same kind of “values”. The companies and manufacturers, of course, also know this too well except they are just not able to come up with different kinds of products every month, so to speak, to meet their customers’ demands. 
	In conclusion, to keep customers on board and enhance sales businesses often advertise their products and services as innovative and new. It helps both customers to satisfy their more-than-life expectations as consumers while also bringing in more revenue to businesses. 
Essay 16:
	Nowadays, most brands place significant emphasis on promoting their products as novel and innovative in their advertising campaigns. This trend is becoming increasingly prevalent, and one that many, including me, believe is a negative development.
	Businesses choose to promote their products this way for many different reasons. First and foremost, new products are often seen as more exciting and appealing to consumers than older products. And when consumers find something appealing, they spend more money to purchase them. Additionally, promoting a product as new and innovative can help a product stand out in the marketplace, and ensure more profit for the business organisation. Perhaps, this is why we see so many variations of cosmetics in a single store, and many of them have been introduced very recently.
	However, in my opinion, it is ultimately a negative trend. First, it can mislead consumers by giving false or fabricated information about a product. This is both unethical and deceitful. Second, The trend can lead to a cycle of constant consumption by many consumers, and after a while, dissuade them from buying products that they believe would be replaced by new products sooner or later. For instance, the demand for newly released Apple products is no longer so high among consumers as they know the brand is going to bring another improved version of the same products in a year or so. 
	Furthermore, the constant emphasis on newness and advertisement campaigns to broadcast them to consumers can lead to a lack of innovation. When businesses are more focused on promoting their products as unique, rather than actually making them pristine, they may be less likely to invest in research and development to create truly innovative products. This can lead to a marketplace full of products that are only slightly different from one another, rather than truly unique and groundbreaking products. An example of this can be seen in the technology industry, where new smartphones are constantly being released with only small improvements over previous models, which can lead to consumer dissatisfaction.
	In conclusion, most enterprises publicise their products as new and innovative, and it is a negative development since it can dupe customers and lead to customer dissatisfaction. Therefore, businesses must focus on creating truly new and innovative products, instead of just promoting them as such.

Essay 17:
	Many citizens, nowadays, are inquisitive to learn about the home they live in as extensively as possible primarily because they want to learn about the background and style of their house, assess the safety, and find out if it is haunted. I believe nearby elderly citizens and the internet could be two invaluable sources for such curious people to find the best possible information about their buildings.
	The knowledge of the background of a house gives people a sense of self-satisfaction. This is why people, especially those who live in a house that was built many years ago, are often interested to find out more about the adobe. The background often includes how the house was painstakingly built in an era when technology was not so advanced. Thus, exploring the background reveals some unique and fascinating facts. For instance, it was a common misconception for many dwellers in the old part of our city that their houses were built during the English colonial era. In fact, researchers recently found that those houses were built mimicking the English styles but by the local masons. It was fascinating to finally learn about it. Moreover, the construction and the built-quality of a house convey much information about the safety and durability of the houses. Knowing such details could prevent people from facing any disaster like falling victim to a collapsed house. Finally, some people superstitiously think a house might be haunted if it has some bad history. Learning about its history often comes from their personal belief and their motivation to either cleanse the house or move off. 
	To get proper information about the houses, people can talk to local senior citizens who had been living there for quite a while. They can offer first-hand information about the building and much more details that are not available elsewhere. On top of that, the internet could be another effective source to get details of a house. For instance, many websites store data about the houses in the UK, and anyone can find them online with just a few mouse clicks.
	In conclusion, people's motivations to learn about their houses could range from safety reasons to simple curiosity, from superstition to practical reasons. To get the best information they can contact elderly locals and browse the internet.
Essay 18:
	The history of a house or a building can be fascinating, sometimes daunting or even mesmerising at times if we try to delve into it. For some people, learning about the history of the houses, in which they live, is utterly important for various reasons. This essay attempts to outline some of those possible reasons for this and a couple of methods to research this.
	The first possible reason for many to become inquisitive about the past of their houses could be that they actually want to find a connection, if any, between themselves and the buildings. Such connections, or lack thereof, could actually provide an insight to them as to whether those buildings contained anything “unique” at some stages of their existence that would make them- the people that is – feel “special” among the others, or “different” from the rest of the crowds in their neighbourhoods. After all, I think that it feels really good to remain at the centre of attention every now and then.
	Some people would be interested to learn about the history of their buildings, especially how they were built, or what kinds of materials were used to construct them because they want to make sure that the buildings are safe enough for living. After all, nobody would want to put their lives at risk by choosing to live in a “weak” building that was built with some “unreliable” materials about a century ago! 
	But, for whatever reasons that they want to learn about the history of their buildings, it is always better that they ask the locals first to get their information about the former residents of their houses. They could also contact the local municipality or the concerned local authority who could apprise them about how the buildings were made. Finally, people could also visit a local library or the authority that keeps the information about old buildings, to learn about the history of buildings in their respective areas. 
	To conclude, people are becoming more and more interested in the history of their houses primarily to find a unique feature of it to feel special or to learn about the architectural style and safety features of the house. They can contact local residents, municipality offices and the library to do the research work required to find the history of their houses.

Essay 19:
	Some individuals support keeping pets around young children as they think it is beneficial while others oppose the idea citing pet-related injuries and fatalities in recent times. In this essay, I shall argue that dangers that stem from young children having pets are overemphasised, sometimes even exaggerated, and children receive substantive psychological benefits from having pets.
	To commence with, most parents allow common and friendly pets like cats, dogs and birds as their children's companions and the number of strange pets like snakes, spiders, apes, etc. are very rare. Such unfamiliar pets, which are a bit wild in nature, have been reported to hurt some children. However, such incidents are so rare that they are negligible because the overwhelming majority of children have non-lethal pets like cats, dogs, fish, rodents and rabbits. For instance, recent statistical data reveals that 93% of children own non-lethal and friendly pets that have almost zero per cent chance of harming or hurting children. So, I believe that pets are not a physical danger to children.
	To shed some light on the positivity of letting children have pets, I can think of many. However, the most important of them is the favourable effects it has on children's psychology and growth. Young pet owners frequently empathise with their pets and perform a diverse range of activities to maintain their well-being. The Cambridge Developmental Psychology Unit found that children who had grown up with pets were 30% less likely to bully others and show aggression. Pets are also conducive to young children's mental growth, and they get involved in interesting activities with their pets that help them realise empathy more deeply. So it is undeniable that a child’s prosociality and mental health can be improved through exposure to pets.
	In conclusion, letting young children possess and interact with friendly pets has important benefits. It is not a threat to children, but rather beneficial to nurture some important good qualities in them. So, it is expected that parents who wish to have pets for their children would consider those benefits and finally select one of the friendly pets for their children. 
Essay 20:
	While some people prefer to keep their children at a distance from pets because of health and safety reasons, others choose to do just the opposite. In this essay, I would like to argue that pets are actually good for the overall well-being of children for some obvious reasons.
	The first reason, of course, is that pets provide the children with comfort and company, especially when nobody else is accompanying them. But, even when somebody is accompanying them, children still feel a sense of comfort in the company of their pets, mainly because those pets are usually more “passive” and “loyal” than other humans. And that is exactly probably why, as some researchers have found, a very significant percentage of parents allow their youngsters to have pets. 
	Pets also help young children with learning. In fact, we often can see the children, who otherwise do not like to read, lying on their beds and reading to their dogs or cats and showing them pictures. The juniors even ask questions to their pets to see if they - the pets, are actually paying enough attention to the readings. In other words, the little ones actually learn important and fun things in a pleasant environment while petting their cats and dogs. Besides, researchers have also monitored that the stress level of the kids goes significantly down when they are with their pets. 
	Finally, some researchers have also found that having pets can reduce a child’s risk of developing certain common allergies. Such research showed that children, who had animals, had fewer positive skin tests for indoor allergens - like a pet and dust-mite allergen, and also outdoor allergens such as ragweed and grass, compared to those juniors who did not live with pets. 
	So, based on these findings, it can easily be argued that pets actually help children's development, rather than harming them.

Essay 21:
	The strength and prospect for the global media to shape the views of today’s youth and to educate them are significant. However, while some opine that the global media and international news, as part of education, have no important impact on secondary education, others believe that international news should be studied by those pupils to reap its benefits. This essay attempts to examine the issue by diving deep into it. I believe that international news as part of the secondary education syllabus is important.
	On the one hand, global media enriches young people's understanding of contemporary affairs and enhances their views and perspectives. It is due to the fact that international affairs, as part of education, not only make them more conscious and knowledgeable but also connect global youths on the same platforms. For example, a study run by Oxford sociologists showed that the media heavily influences teenagers’ knowledge of contemporary affairs which has a highly positive impact on making them aware of the world. This awareness makes them global citizens and encourages them to share ideas.
	On the contrary, many critics argue that teenagers would be negatively affected by the global media’s focus on negative issues of international events like wars and civil unrest if they are included in their education. This is because exposure to violence often leads to depression and the youths may grow an apathy towards our history and global politics. For example, recent surveys have discovered that despondent teenagers usually cite the dismal state of the world as a source of their depression. Since mental health is an important objective of secondary education, it is, therefore, questionable whether the study of international news would benefit young students.
	In conclusion, it is clear that there are reasons for and against the study of news in secondary schools. However, educators and authorities can make it more useful by adopting proper policy and teaching methods, and reap the benefits of teaching young students international news as part of their academic education.
Essay 22:
	International news can be a great source of knowledge and information from time to time, but that does not necessarily mean that it should formally be included in the secondary school curricula as one of the school subjects. In this essay, I will try to explain why I have taken such a stance on this issue. 
	The primary reason is that most of the children from the secondary school level have rather tender minds and hearts, and as such, they will not actually be able to make sense of the many negative and controversial things that take place all over the world on a daily basis. After all, we do not live in an ideal world.  Besides, most news media today provide “biased” news which sometimes could not be any farther from truth, and these young children just do not have the required cultural, social, economic and political awareness to penetrate into the biased news, in order to separate the facts from fiction. So, instead of becoming more smart and knowledgeable about the world, in which they live, they will probably become more sad, prejudiced, and confused, if not hostile, about it should they be required to study international news as a school subject. 
	Secondly, secondary school children already have to study many other challenging subjects, such as math, language, physics, chemistry, social science, history, and geography, and adding one more subject to that list would only create more pressure on those children. And with this extra pressure of study, those children would not most likely have enough time to play and socialise with their friends which are needed to ensure proper physical and mental growth. Finally, it is also possible that these teenage, restless children are getting distracted easily by many of the confusing, complicated and biased news every now and then, so much so that it would actually affect their studies rather negatively.
	In conclusion, if we analyse these points, mentioned above, with an objective mind, we will have to agree that including international news as a school subject at a secondary level is not such a good idea, after all.

Essay 23:
	Fresh water, which is vital for the survival of humans and other flora and fauna, has always been a scarce natural resource on our planet, and this has been more acute in dried parts of the world. Due to rapid population growth and industrialisation, scarcity of this valuable resource has become a global issue. In this essay, I shall outline the main factors that have contributed to this problem and then elicit certain steps that can be taken to address this problem.
	Regarding the reasons for the increasing demands for fresh water, population explosion is perhaps the most contributing factor. It is only natural that an inflated global population means more demand for freshwater - without which we can not live. Rapid industrialisation has also increased the demand for salt-free water. For instance, millions of cars are being produced every year, and a startling amount of fresh water is required in the process. Finally, urbanisation, human activities and industrialisation have polluted many natural fresh water reserves and have compounded the graveness of this issue.
	As for the solutions to this intense and looming issue, strict legislation for preserving natural fresh water is required. No factories or industries should be allowed to carry on activities that poss threats to making freshwater sources polluted. Moreover, to reverse the already polluted reservoirs, the government should enact infrastructures for purification of them. More scientific experiments and research are required to convert seawater into saline-free water, which, I believe, will help in meeting the growing requirement of freshwater. Similarly, ordinary people can also contribute towards this noble cause by conserving water and also by limiting their daily household water usage. They should also refrain from performing activities that will pollute natural freshwater reserves.
	In conclusion, fresh water is a limited resource without which we can not survive. This is why both the authorities and individuals should take every measure to save the already inadequate resource and find ways to purify seawater into freshwater.

Essay 24:
	Whether job applicants’ social skills are more important than their academic qualifications is a much-debated issue, and employers' opinions, regarding this, vary. I agree with the opinion that the social skills of candidates are more vital than their academic results, and in this essay, I will explain the reason for this belief.
	The benefits of excellent social skills of a job seeker are apparent. Firstly, communication is the key to career success in modern days. This is primarily because the 21st century is best portrayed by constant interaction with different people, no matter the communication media - in person or online. Secondly, the ability to sell products or services is of paramount significance in any business – this requires strong social skills. For example, an employee with excellent social skills is able to have an impact in front of customers or clients; as a result, products or services can be perceived as high-value. Furthermore, employees with better social skills are generally more easy-going, which is very important to the workplace, including the employer. After all, as the saying goes, “who you work with is as important as what you do”, and an enjoyable work environment needs socially skilful employees. 
	In contrast, some employers may claim that academic qualifications are a prerequisite for employment. Apparently, many positions require certain academic qualifications. However, in modern-day society, more and more employers have realised that whether employees can get the results that the business wants is the key to a business’s success. It can be seen that qualifications do not play a key role in this regard. 
	In conclusion, I believe employees’ social skills are of extreme importance for a company or organisation. Also, I would suggest employers consider job applicants’ social skills first, which I believe would bring long-term benefits for the company and make a positive impact.
Essay 25:
	The hiring managers are always on the hunt to recruit the best employees. But, should they put more emphasis on the social skills of job candidates than on their academic qualifications and other skills is open to discussion and debate. For me, the answer is “no”, and this essay will explain why.
	We may wonder but can not exactly be sure why there is so much buzz about this “social skills” thing. For better or worse, the scope and benefits of a candidate's social skills - for instance, communication skills, flexibility and cooperation, positive mentality and so on - while ignoring other important qualifications are not exactly defined and accepted universally just as yet, except in some industries like “hospitality” and “healthcare”.  And that is exactly why we never really blame or question, for example, an accountant’s “social skills” level when he makes a mistake in preparing a “ledger” or “balance sheet”. Rather, we question or blame his or her commitment, experience, expertise or poor educational background.
	Besides, it is still a common practice in the professional world that most employers today first ask about the academic qualifications of a prospective job candidate. And when that prospective candidate meets the minimum academic qualifications and/or experience requirements, then, and only then, the employers go to find out about the “social skills” level of that candidate. It is never the other way around. I found this to be specifically true in my case as well when I applied for several jobs in the past.
	In conclusion, the social skills of a job seeker are important, but, such social skills are of very limited value unless they are supported by some good academic qualifications and other important skills.

Essay 26:
	We have moved into a technology-driven era where technology is affecting many different aspects of our life, and education is no exception. So, in some schools, traditional methods of education have been revolutionised by new technology to the extent that the lecture is no longer the main method of teaching students. While this new approach has some advantages, it also has many significant shortcomings. This essay outlines both the advantages of disadvantages of this novel approach.
	Perceivably the biggest advantage of the use of the latest technology in education is the flexibility it offers. This is evident in two different ways-  firstly, it is now no longer essential for students to be present in the classroom for their courses. The COVID-19 pandemic has specifically taught us how this flexibility could be a lifesaver. Moreover, the distance learning facility enables employed professionals, housewives and people from different countries to enrol and successfully finish useful courses offered by numerous institutes. Another area of flexibility is of course the interactive tools like "Moodles", for example, the lecturers can use to deliver their courses to large numbers of students.
	Not everything, however, about the introduction of this new technology into education is useful. To start, not all students are comfortable with using technology, even if they are part of the digital native generation. This is a grave issue as they may suffer from their lack of technological skills and interests. For instance, an overwhelming number of students, almost 75%, despite their enthusiasm for smartphones and computers, reported that they do not like online classes. Another related issue is that education is a human activity, and it works best with as much human interaction as possible. Impersonal technology cannot replace the human contact found in traditional face-to-face tutorials and seminars. Thus a piece of technology or tool can never be an alternative to expert tutors who know their students individually and act and teach them accordingly.
	To conclude, technology in education brings some important benefits and enables distance learning possible. It also becomes the only way of learning and teaching during lockdown and pandemics. However, due to the fact that it can be too impersonal for some and discourages others for their lack of technological skills or passion, it is still not the best method to teach and learn.
Essay 27:
	Technology has touched every aspect of our life today, so much so that we can not think of living without it, even for a day. The world of “teaching and learning” is no exception, and this essay will try to explain what benefits and demerits incorporating technology in this field have brought.
	Perhaps the most visible advantage of it is that it allows students to access more and varieties of information with just a few mouse clicks. Students, with the help of technology, can choose to research topics, and fill their interests and needs, much more easily than by going to a library where resources may be limited. And the best thing about it is that all this can be done in a group, freeing the teacher to attend to other individual students in more need. In other words, using technology in this way ensures that all the students get what they need, and also when they need it while allowing teachers to focus more on academically poor students.
	Another advantage is that technology helps students accommodate multiple styles of learning. For example, some students respond better when communicated verbally rather than in written words. For such students, recorded lessons, audiobooks, and podcasts can effectively be woven into their lesson plans so that they can extract the benefits.
	However, while technology has allowed both teachers and students alike to accomplish more, it is not without disadvantages. One such disadvantage is that it has significantly reduced the “face-to-face interaction” between students and teachers. This “face-to-face interaction” is very important because it helps students not just acquire facts, but also understand, interpret, and apply these facts into useful and interesting knowledge. More importantly, without such interaction, it is very highly unlikely that teachers would be able to help students build self-esteem and confidence and emotional maturity, especially, when there is so much bullying in and around the classrooms. 
	To conclude, technology is a reality of our life today, and we just can not ignore it even if we want to. Therefore, we should be judicious in using it in the field of education and learning in order to extract maximum benefits.

Essay 28:
	Some people affirm that students in male or female-only schools have better chances for academic achievements, whereas, many others point out that co-ed schools offer students better social skills for their future. This essay will discuss both these views, but the writer is in favour of a mixed-sex school.
	Admittedly, single-sex schools have fewer distractions. This is because if a school has only boys or girls, students would not be distracted by members of the opposite sex at school; hence, they can focus on their learning. But, these students still have access to the other gender after school, which means, in reality, they must meet the other gender anyway. Consequently, single-sex schools do not guarantee better academic performance and results.
	On the contrary, students studying at mixed schools have more chances to communicate with members of the opposite sex. In other words, children learn how to interact with the other gender at an early age; therefore, their social skills would certainly be fostered. Moreover, mixed schools give students opportunities to deal with conflicts with the other gender, which strengthens students’ problem-solving skills. For instance, when a boy has a conflict with a girl, both of them must learn how to cope. This lesson must be learned sooner or later; as a result, students benefit more if they can learn it sooner. Finally, mixed schools provide students with a real-life scenario where both genders co-exist. Specifically, students can learn in an organic environment in which boys and girls must know how to interact with each other.
	In conclusion, I would concede that single-sex schools have some minor advantages. Despite that combined schools certainly support students better and prepare learners to become more socially adept. Overall, I am convinced that students should go to mixed schools for better professional, social and adult life.
Essay 29:
	The debate over whether single-sex schooling is superior to a “co-educational” system has been rumbling on for decades. But, after analyzing the views and opinions from both sides in an objective manner, it would be fairly easy to conclude that the “single-sex” option is slightly better, and this essay will try to explain why that is the case.
	It is true to some extent that the “co-ed” schooling system provides students with better social skills. After all, in such a system, boys and girls can learn to behave with each other from a very young age and grow together to be cooperative. Besides, the interaction between boys and girls isolates some of the “less desirable aspects” of both sexes.
	On the contrary, a considerable advantage of single-sex education is that students in this educational system feel much more relaxed than their “co-ed” counterparts. Such relaxed feelings are cultivated in the absence of a “desire” to impress or attract the opposite sex. In other words, students in such an environment are more true to themselves and have the freedom to behave as they please, and as such, they are more willing to take risks since there is no fear of failing in front of the members of the opposite sex. As a result, the classrooms are more often dynamic, free, and bursting with ideas and conversation - all are hallmarks of a great education.  
	Besides, many studies and research suggest that boys and girls tend to learn different things differently. For example, girls are usually ahead in reading, writing and spelling, while boys are ahead in mathematics. Boys need more intensive input in these areas of literacy, so only separating them would ensure that they are getting proper guidelines and lessons in these areas.
	Therefore, from the discussion above, we can conclude that single-sex education should be a preferred option even though mixed education can sometimes provide better social skills to young learners.

Essay 30:
	The growing number of cars on the roads and reckless driving are the major causes of increasing road accidents these days. Therefore, many people, as well as some politicians, express their view that repetitive driving tests, and not just one test to get and renew the licence, should be in place. This essay outlines some advantages as well as disadvantages of the continuous testing process and opines that this has more benefits.
	To start with the demerits of repeat driving tests, this process may unnecessarily impose a burden on people. This is because they will have to prepare for the test, pay for it, and allocate time for the test in order to renew the licence. As a result, many people may tend to avoid the tests, and one day, get pulled over and fined for an outdated licence. Moreover, it will cost money to the authority as well. Therefore, it may not solve the issue easily while both the drivers and the authority will be under pressure.
	To outline the advantages, road safety in a country is a major concern and so is the obligation of legislators regarding this. Increasing vehicular movements and drivers' recklessness are two primary reasons for accidents on the roads. Drivers get outdated and more inept to new road rules and safety practices. For example, with age, many drivers may not see the traffic signals and road signs easily. As a result, such drivers may potentially hit other moving vehicles and people. Therefore, the repeat tests for driving, from time to time, will definitely improve the safety on roads. Moreover, many young drivers do not abide by the traffic rules, and continuous tests would ensure their awareness of safe driving. Finally, when people will have to take driving tests periodically, they will remain updated about traffic and safety rules.
	In conclusion, reoccurring driving tests improve people's driving accuracy, make them aware of safety and laws, and find out potentially risky drivers. So the benefits of such tests surpass the drawbacks.
Essay 31:
	Taking appropriate measures to stop road accidents is important due to their direct impact on the social environment, and forcing the drivers to take regular driving tests could possibly be one such measure. But, this measure has more disadvantages than advantages. This essay will outline the advantages and demerits of repeat driving tests, and try to explain the reasons why this had more drawbacks. 
	No doubt repeat driving tests would eventually flush some, but not all, bad, crazy, and dangerous drivers out of the system. It would also probably put some “restrictions” on those drivers who can not drive properly anymore because of their old age or some debilitating illnesses. It is also possible that regular driving tests would alert or motivate some drivers to become more careful with their driving because of the fear that their driving licenses could be cancelled at any time. 
	But, none of these advantages can be ensured or achieved without a high cost, as well as extra effort and time. After all, the state would need to employ additional resources, and thereby an additional budget as well, to take care of the additional driving examinations. In all probabilities, governments would then probably pass these additional costs or expenses on to the vehicle owners or drivers as extra taxes to cut government expenditures. These additional taxes would certainly weigh down heavily on these drivers and vehicle owners.
	Now, even if these vehicle owners are ready to carry the burden of extra tax money and time, they would not necessarily be ready to remain under constant fear of being stripped of their driving privileges because of some “one-off” mistakes during the time of regular driving testing. Essentially, the same sentiment was echoed by a former director of AAA (American Automobile Association) of traffic safety advocacy and research who said that regular driving tests had been shown to reduce mobility by way of drivers voluntarily giving up their licenses due to fear of getting them taken away rather than any legitimate concerns about their driving.
	To conclude, the disadvantages of regular driving tests would outweigh their advantages. This is why the authority should think wisely before taking such measures when it comes to repeat driving tests and road safety.
Essay 32:
	The number of automobiles on roads is increasing rapidly these days which is aligned with the number of road accidents. Consequently, some opine that all driving licence holders must take a driving test periodically rather than taking it only once in their life. The following essay will discuss both the positive and negative sides of the repeat driving test. Personally, I believe that this process has more benefits than drawbacks.
	It is undeniable that taking a repeat driving test would have some distinct disadvantages for people. One of the major drawbacks is the time and preparation it would require. In addition, people would have to pay every time to take the test. Finally, they also believe that it would cost more for the government as they must provide additional manpower, logistics and facilities in the driving test centres.
	Despite all the negative aspects, performing a repeat driving test would have some significant benefits for everybody. Firstly, by having a repeat driving test, each driver would be updated with driving regulations. Secondly, drivers would be more cautious when they drive as their license will be checked regularly. Thirdly, it will reduce the number of traffic accidents because the driver's physical condition would also be examined as a part of the test. For example, each driver's eyesight would be examined as some drivers might have poor eyesight which may cause accidents. Thus repeat driving tests will drastically reduce road accidents.
	In conclusion, conducting a driving test periodically has some drawbacks, but I do believe that it has more benefits for everybody. It is expected that regular driving tests will reduce the number of road accidents to a great extent.

Essay 33:
	Global tourism is enjoying an upsurge in popularity nowadays. However, this trend is accompanied by many complaints that similarities of the landscapes considerably reduce the delights and attractions of the travel. Globalisation, in my mind, is the greatest reason for the similarities. I also think that it has more disadvantages than benefits.
	No doubt, globalisation unifies the world in many different aspects. Girls in Shanghai can be witnessed to have the same street look as those in Paris and Milan; KFC and Pizza Hut are popular in Bangkok as they are back in California; the amazing film "2012" was premiered internationally at the same moment. Tourist attractions cannot escape from this sweeping trend. Therefore, it is quite normal to hear comments from a tourist in Hong Kong, claiming that what he or she has seen is just the same as in Tokyo.
	This phenomenon, to me, is a depressing one. People may have sacrificed too many of their cultural identities for this. Culture is our ancestors' most treasurable heritage that is supposed to be passed on from generation to generation. It would be disastrous if people could only recall those busy shopping streets instead of the traditional lanes and houses after their trip to Vietnam. And I remember how frustrated I was when I found a lot of popular souvenirs in some foreign countries that could be bought back in Ho Chi Minh City — those delicate wooden sculptures really seemed far less appealing to me.
	To conclude, since the trend of globalisation is inevitable, I suggest that both the government and the public make joint efforts in protecting and preserving their unique cultural features. Otherwise, global tourism would eventually turn to be boring and pointless.
Essay 34:
	Our world has essentially become a global village, and it is only expected that things, including sceneries in different places, would look similar in one way or another. Contrary to many popular beliefs and suggestions, I think that these similarities carry more advantages than disadvantages, and this essay will explain why, as well as the reason behind such similarities.
	Globalization is perhaps the single most contributing factor which makes cities look similar, makes western food common in distant Asian countries, and inspires Africans to wear dresses designed by European designers. For instance, the last time I travelled to Tokyo in Japan, a city that was supposed to be quite a contrast from London or New York, I could hardly believe that I was out of my homeland!
	Of course, opponents to this trend would suggest that it has more disadvantages since they are not being able to see or experience anything “new” by investing their time and money. Some would also claim that in this way, they are losing the benefits of their unique cultural identities, and the privileges that are associated with them. But, if we look at the bigger picture, we will see that such similarities are actually bringing us closer to each other, by eliminating at least some of the misunderstandings among us, as well as some invisible, man-made, cultural “barriers”, we had, among each other. And when we have a sense of more “closeness” among us, we will try harder to cooperate with each other to eradicate poverty and suffering from our world, sooner rather than later. Here we can actually dare argue that if we had such “cooperation” among us in the past, we did not really need to deal with people like “Hitler” or “Genghis khan”.
	In conclusion, we do not need some sceneries or popular landmarks to become symbols of “cultural and identity separation”, rather we want them to minimize the “difference” among us. And that is exactly what happens when we find places and sceneries to be similar to each other in different countries, even though its effects are not always visible and measurable.

Essay 35:
	How children study and learn today, both at home and school, are radically different from the past, and the increased availability and relatively low price of modern technology have been instrumental in this change. However, I feel that while modern technologies, such as computers and the Internet, are important in assisting a child's learning, this learning should be guided and directed by the experience of human teachers.
	Undeniably, computers and the Internet are extensively used in education, and they can present knowledge in a vivid and novel way. The computer and the Internet can also enable students to enhance their general understanding of how to solve difficulties in the study as well as giving them vital skills in readiness for later life. However, the problems are - the information that the computer can show has to be preprogrammed and needs constant updating. For example, the Internet may not be always a reliable source for knowledge, since there is often conflicting and fake information available when taken from unauthentic sources.
	To conclude, I do not believe that it will help students to learn effectively and in an impressive manner to overemphasising the use of computers and the Internet. Rather, I feel that modern technologies can complement more traditional teaching and learning methods without being used as a replacement for these traditions.

Essay 36:
	Young people’s approach toward hobbies is changing dramatically, and it is often influenced by technology and the modern world. At present, shopping as a favourite pastime activity is becoming extremely popular, especially among youngsters. Admittedly, shopping outlets' services, lucrative offers, rapid changes in technology, and digital advertisements are playing key roles in making this trend popular. However, unnecessary shopping is a waste of time and money, which, I believe, could be better utilised by youths.
	The modern world we live in has many new technologies, gadgets, and fashion items, and they change so frequently that it is almost impossible to remain fashionable, trendy and updated without shopping regularly. Many people, especially youngsters, go shopping regularly because they feel those items are necessary for them. Since brands release new items quite often, the young generation goes shopping frequently. Digital advertisements by big and small brands also reach millions of youngsters and constantly lure them to get fashionable items to look and feel good, and sometimes their offers and discounts are quite good to be missed! For instance, renowned brands like Nike or some small brands often give up to 50% discount which drags many youngsters to their outlets.
	Youths can use their leisure time in more productive activities and hobbies like going out and doing exercise, socialising with others, getting involved in charity works and taking part in different outdoor sports. These activities will keep them mentally and physically fit and make a far more healthy young generation without chronic diseases and obesity. Besides, they can invest time in reading, which will broaden their imagination and enhance their knowledge. For example, it is evident that students who like to read a lot do much better in exams and end up having a better career than those who hardly read books outside of their academic syllabus.
	To conclude, I believe that shopping is important when it is restricted to buying necessary items. But if it becomes an obsession by young people, it is a problem. They should better spend the money and time doing things that would benefit them in the long run.

I, however, disagree with this notion and believe that the authority should find better measures to address this rather than limiting the tourism industry with the burden of extra tax.
	The key reason why I believe that governments ought to avoid levying more taxes on flights and accommodations is that tourism creates employment for local people and makes economic movements in the region. It also brings significant foreign remittance to the country. Many countries, St. Lucia, Maldives and Thailand, for example, heavily depend on the steady earnings of their tourism sector. It also makes people tolerant of different cultures and lets them learn about diverse cultures and traditions. If more taxes are imposed on the movement and accommodation of tourists, it would bring catastrophic results for many countries. Therefore, measures which would entail a decline in tourists should not be implemented.
	To control pollution and excessive wastage, authorities can employ workers to clean their surroundings while instructing visitors not to pollute the environment. Policies to improve the manners of tourists should be implemented as well. Improving public buses and dedicating transport to foreign tourists can reduce traffic congestion to a great extent. Moreover, scientific research and engineering feats can reduce the pollution created by vehicles and aeroplanes, and money should be spent on such research works. These solutions would improve the situation on the one hand, and not deprive citizens of jobs and economic freedom on the other hand.
	To conclude, extra levies on tourist transportation and accommodation will limit the inflow of tourists, putting local citizens' livelihoods at risk, especially in tourism-dependant countries. It is expected that the authorities would find better solutions that try to control pollution created by tourists’ actions in travel destinations instead of reducing their number.
Essay 38:
	Tourism, no doubt, is important for many countries for several reasons, including its economic, social and cultural benefits. But, at the same time, we can not deny that tourism, if left unregulated, creates some problems, and governments should intervene to mitigate some of these issues by imposing extra taxes on flights and accommodation.
	To begin with, tourism, one of the 10th largest industries in the world, is important for many countries. But, it becomes worrisome when it puts some undue pressure on natural resources through over-consumption, especially, in places where resources, infrastructure and facilities are already scarce. To reduce the overconsumption of resources, the government's initiatives to impose extra taxes could work like magic. Here we can specifically mention the small island countries, like Cyprus and Malta, which struggle to accommodate a large number of tourists. Hefty taxes seems like their only solution.
	Not to mention, of course, the air and water pollution, among other negative effects, that are caused by the massive tourist transportation activities, both in air and sea, could also be controlled by imposing a travel tax. With more than a billion people travelling each year, the government needs regulations to keep the activity in check to minimise its negative effects. One way to effectively do that is to impose extra charges and taxes on accommodations and travel. Some European countries have already implemented policies to protect their tourist destinations, in quiet, non-offensive ways, by controlling the number of hotel beds, the number of flights to and from a country, and the number of tour buses allowed. No doubt, these are some good steps to control the flow of tourists, but they would yield even better results if these initiatives are supported by a tax increase on things like flights and hotel accommodation.
	To conclude, tourism is important but too many tourists and their uncontrolled movement can have negative consequences. So the government should levy taxes on their accommodation and travel to keep a check on the number of tourists, and this can be a great step towards saving the tourist's destinations and the world.

Essay 39:
	People use computers more extensively these days than ever before, and it is so widespread in our modern world that even children have access to these devices for playing games. This essay discusses the disadvantages of playing digital games on computer devices by youngsters and suggests some measures to reduce its negative effects.
	Concerning the adverse impacts of young children playing video games, the most devastating one is the addiction these games create. Millions of dollars are spent to make computer games so that they attract a large number of audiences and keep them glued to the computer screens. So they are addictive by design. And this obsession hampers children's outdoor activities, studies and even time to socialise and learn important life skills. To illustrate, many research works suggest that children who spend many hours playing computer games each day end up performing poorly in schools and avoid social events and outdoor activities. It results in physical and psychological issues including poor eyesight and despair. Moreover, violent games cloud the youngsters' judgement and make their rational thinking unstable. Oftentimes, youngsters who play violent games develop violent behaviours. To cite an example, an unfortunate shooting event that claimed many innocent lives took place in an American school a few years ago was carried out by a teenager who was addicted to shooting games.
	To minimise the severity of these negative impacts, parents must monitor what their children are doing, especially on computers. They should not be allowed to play computer games for more than a couple of hours each week, and parents can actively participate in those games with their children so that it becomes family time. An ideal example of it could be my aunt and uncle who play video games with their children, and as a result, children are also interested in doing outdoor activities with them. Finally, parents can use parental control over the digital content and games their children watch or play. These measures would deter children from downloading and playing games that are not suitable for their age.
	To conclude, computer games, when played excessively by children, have many detrimental effects. Proper parenting and monitoring seem like the best solution to solve these problems.

Essay 40:
	Technology has revolutionised the way audiences watch movies these days. With the internet, smartphones and tablets, we can now watch movies anywhere and anytime. Some people believe that this is a substitute for going to the cinema. Personally, I think that movie theatres deliver an unparalleled experience as not all movies can be enjoyed on small screens.
	On the one hand, the advent of smart devices has put the cinema business at stake as it has redefined how people can watch a movie. Recently, many people have begun relying on their smartphones to watch their favourite videos and movies at their convenience. For example, many mobile applications, such as Netflix, provide users access to millions of contents at an affordable price, including those that are not shown in theatres. This has given people a good reason to enjoy movies with their family at home. It would be costly and inconvenient if people had to watch those movies in the cinema.
	On the other hand, theatres give an unmatched experience that viewers can not get while watching movies on a small hand-held screen. For example, in movie theatres, films are projected on a large screen with a high-quality surrounding sound system and a comfortable seat, where spectators can enjoy the film to its fullest. In addition, many cinema providers have recently introduced new theatre concepts to cater to various customer segments and included a wide range of cuisines in their dine-in options. If cinemas cease to exist, movie-lovers would be deprived of such an immersive experience. Moreover, watching movies in a theatre is more than enjoying a movie, it is a great way of socialising. To give an example, whenever I watch a movie with my friends, it is more enjoyable due to the social interaction and enjoyment it offers.
	In conclusion, despite the convenience the smart devices provide for movie-watchers, I strongly believe that theatres still remain an important option, especially for movie-goers, who prefer experience over convenience.

Essay 41:
	Nowadays, the ratio of employed people who suffer from different health-related issues is increasing faster than ever and their general health condition is deteriorating. Such a cataclysm has stemmed from work pressure, lack of physical exercise and dependency on machines to do our work. Exercise, encouragement from the employer and the government to do workouts, and finally, a balanced diet are the solutions to this problem.
	One of the primary reasons for working people not to do enough or any exercise is the abysmal working condition where working life is extremely competitive and full of anxiety. For instance, employers have constant deadlines and tough targets at their offices, and to achieve them, they have to work for long hours each day. It drains their stamina, and as a consequence, they do not want to do any exercise even when they are at home. In addition, dependency on technology has deteriorated the condition. Due to technological advancements, people have exchanged the available time for exercise with browsing the internet, watching television and checking their accounts on social media websites. They also prefer to drive than to walk, and use washing machines to clean their clothes - just to give some examples. This trend, in turn, has negative impacts on their health.
	To address this problem, physical exercise is a "must". To remain fit, those workers have to stop leading a sedentary lifestyle and start moving. The government can facilitate outdoor activities so that people get out and take part in those activities after office hours. Employers have to realise that healthy employees mean better productivity and they should arrange exercise facilities at the office premises. To give an example of how sports and exercise facilities can encourage employees to do some workout, we can take offices near the parks and gyms as an example. It is evident that employees in those offices are practically more inclined to do exercise than those who are located in areas where public parks and exercise facilities are rare. Finally, the workers have to follow a balanced diet to achieve a better result, and the office can help them with that too.
	In conclusion, exercise is essential to our health, productivity and life. In consequence, workers, authorities, employers, and individuals should collaborate to make everyone's lifestyle healthier by adding more time for exercise and helping follow a balanced diet.

Essay 42:
	Music plays a crucial role in our lives and eliminates differences among various cultures and generations. It symbolises harmony and reflects humanity. So, I agree with the notion that music helps bring people from various cultures and generations together.
	One of the reasons music excretes the barriers among different nations and cultures is that people enjoy music from every part of the world, and it speaks the same language, which embodies human emotion, joy, love and sorrow. Music does not need interpretation to be enjoyed and understood as it touches our hearts and resonates in our minds. No matter what language we speak or understand, we appreciate the melody and depth of music which is why people of all ages can sit together and enjoy the same music. For instance, some viral music in foreign languages in our country signifies how it speaks our minds and hearts rather than just a human language.
	Moreover, nations influence each other with the type of music they produce and the type of musical instruments they use. This amalgamation reduces cultural differences and brings people from different cultures and ages to a common platform. To cite an example, many music genres, that we enjoy these days, were derived from multiple nations and cultures and people from all these cultures enjoy and love them.
	Finally, music is an art form which is enjoyed by all, and this helps reduce the generation and age gaps among people. To illustrate, when the national anthem is played, children, adults and elders all tune to the same emotion, which is patriotism, and their unity is stronger than ever. The same can be said when music evokes other emotions like love, sadness and so on. Besides, some music categories are loved by all, and the listeners feel a sense of togetherness in a divine way which is almost absent in other art forms. It not only eliminates age gaps but also the generation and cultural gaps.
	In conclusion, music, as a universally accepted and supreme art form, enriches our lives and strengthens the connections between us, regardless of our backgrounds, culture and age.
Essay 43:
	Music can stimulate our minds and bodies and also offer some temporary relief from mental agony and sadness. Music probably can do many other things, but it can not bring people of different cultures and ages together. And this essay will explain why we can not rely on music to accomplish such a difficult task.
	Music has some elements and qualities to bring some like-minded people within, not outside of a certain culture, country or nation closer together in a common bond because the tone and tune of that music sound so familiar to them. Many music lovers even suggest that music is the food for our soul, regardless of our ages. True that may be, but when we are pinning our hopes on music to unite people of different cultures and ages, we are becoming too much optimistic, to say the least, because culture is a very difficult subject to understand and so is “human nature”.
	Culture is not only about what we like to listen to, or what we do not for some temporary pleasure or gratification.  Rather, culture, among other things, very predominantly is also about “how we are so dissimilar to each other”, and it is essentially this “wish” or “sentiment” that helps us cling to our own ways of life, no matter how “peculiar” or “weird” that may look to other cultures. It is because of this strong “sentiment” that even though, almost all the countries in the continent of South America essentially speak the same language or practice the same religion, they are not merged into only one country. The same applies to different ages as well, and that is why we see, more often than not, that while a young guy likes some heavy rock or heavy metal music, an older person likes a more traditional or classic type of music.
	So, from the discussion above, it should be fairly clear to us that music is important for our life, but it is not a good way to bring people of different cultures or ages together.

Essay 44:
	The tremendous expansion of the metropolises and the worsening environment in such areas are major dilemmas in the contemporary world. Our classic towns and villages, with gardens and playgrounds, have turned into ugly concrete jungles, and that has led to a deterioration in people's living standards. This has primarily happened due to the mass migration to cities for better careers and amenities. The establishment of pristine societies and self-reliant suburban systems can improve the situation dramatically.
	This urban sprawl could be attributed to two primary reasons. First, the migration of skilled and unskilled workers from rural to modernized societies, seeking better jobs and higher quality of life, has accelerated it. It is evident that tens of thousands of people move to cities each year where they think they will have better careers and earnings. Secondly, city-centric education, healthcare, and other amenities have tempted people to move to cities. Take my grandfather as an example who moved to our capital city approximately 45 years ago with the hope that he would ensure better education for his children. This colossal movement of population to metro areas has increased the cost of living while declining the living standard.
	The government needs to find effective solutions to check the mass migration of people to cities, and also prevent the deterioration of these municipalities and people's living standards there. Firstly, the construction of pristine societies where environmental standards can rival what used to be in our cities in retrospect could be a great initiative. Then, the authority can encourage people to live in towns and rural areas by providing important facilities, such as health coverage, free education, and child benefits. For instance, if people in suburban areas are offered health insurance and education for free, they would not plan to move to cities where treatments and child education are generally much more expensive. Moreover, the development of the suburban area to create more jobs is also essential without compromising its green nature. This could be achieved by constructing more schools, offices, and business centres while also setting higher minimum wages in these areas.
	In conclusion, the explosion of population in municipalities kills our future and hope. So we - the government, civil societies and individuals, must tackle this crisis before it aggravates beyond our control.
Essay 45:
	Rapid developments in megacities and mass migration of population to these metropolitans with the hope of better life, career and future have ushered in a perplexing conundrum that leads to a worsening life standard, crowd and pollution in such big cities. City-centric development, better-earning prospects and amenities in large cities have primarily stimulated the development of this situation. The government needs to decentralise and focus on the development of suburban and rural areas to reverse the scenario. 
	Most megacities develop faster than any other part of the country and attract millions of people who migrate from other areas. This situation stems from the fact that the authority enables city-centric growth which makes the big cities the hub for business, trade, manufacturing, education, research, employment and so on. This city-centric development forces people to move to big cities to add more woes to the already deteriorating situation there. A large factory, for example, in a city can hire thousands of people, and most of these employees come there for a better career. Moreover, most universities, colleges, hospitals, offices and other amenities are located in the heart of the large cities, and people move there to access those facilities. A recent statistic points out that more than 80 thousand students move to our capital city each year to get enrolled in different college and university courses. 
	To solve the ever-increasing population burden and pollution in metropolitan areas, the government has to move out many offices, colleges, factories and so on to remote areas. Without relocating those, the expectation of reducing pollution and crowd in big cities is far-fetched and impractical. For instance, at least 2.5 million factory workers live in our capital city who can not afford proper accommodation, sanitary bathrooms and clean drinking water. Diseases can spread faster there than anywhere else and could risk the whole city in the process. To move those people to suburban or rural areas, the government has to decentralise. Moreover, the development focus should not be only city-centric. It should rather be properly distributed. This will make sure people have jobs in rural areas and are not forced to move to a large city.
	In conclusion, the phenomenal growth of cities poses different problems and increases pollution, and traffic congestion, and decreases living standards. Decentralisation and rural area-centric development can reverse the situation to a great extent.

Essay 46:
	Stress slays us from the inside and can lead to personal, social, physical and psychological issues that drive us to the verge of dilapidation. Stress and anxiety are far more severe and widespread among the modern generation than in their forefathers. The reasons for this crisis could be attributed to poor working conditions and the worldwide financial crisis. Several initiatives could be taken to address this problem.
	One of the primary reasons for the extensive stress-related problems in the modern era is the demanding and highly competitive work environment. Constant work pressure, deadlines, and job insecurity lead to lengthier office hours, which leave little or no family or personal time. It disrupts our relationships, social life, and sleep pattern, and fosters unhealthy diet habits and sedentary lifestyles. For instance, with the ever-increasing working hours, employees sleep fewer hours than ever before, and the majority of them do not cook healthy meals at home. The final result is a more stressful life and deteriorating health conditions.
	Another reason for this horrendous problem is the global economic crisis and rampant inflation. As a result, many people find it extremely difficult to meet their expenses and often get trapped in loans and debts. Bankruptcy is increasing, and more people are trying to get a second job to support their lifestyle than ever before. The result is more depression and distress, which even leads to suicides.
	As a solution to this social catastrophe, governments should enact laws to restrict working hours and push employers to improve the working environment for their employees. In addition, financial aid to needy people and mentorship and therapy programmes for already sufferers are needed. Finally and most importantly, we, as individuals, have to be more prudent in our lifestyle choice, expenses, savings and retirement plans, and spend quality time with our family to eliminate stress and tension. To give an example, even after having a busy professional life, people who choose to lead a healthy life often tend to suffer less from depression, anxiety and stress. So our choices matter.
	In conclusion, stress is a silent killer and impedes our performance, deteriorates our health and destroys our relationships. It is expected that individuals and governments will work hard to make a stress-free modern world for all.
Essay 47:
	"Stress" is a curse in our modern-day world, and it is the reason for some serious health concerns today, compared to our forefather's generation. In this essay, I shall discuss what causes stress, and how to deal with it.
	Stress and stress-related problems are so common today around the world because we constantly expect way too much out of our life than what our parents and grandparents used to expect. As a result of this, we try to do too many things, at once, thinking that those things will make us feel happier and better. But, of course, we are only human, and we just can not do so many things, without putting a huge burden and strain on us!
	Apart from this “expecting too much out of our life” thing, issues like finance, family and relationship problem, and work-related pressure also cause people to stress in one way or another. But, out of all these matters, financial issues seem to top the list. In fact, according to a recent survey, the majority of the study participants reported money being a significant source of stress, with 77% feeling considerable anxiety about finances. It is accelerated by our imprudent spending habits and rampant inflations.
	But, whatever may cause this menace called “stress” among us, the end result is that it is causing some serious health concerns for many of us, and that is why we need to get rid of it. And to do so, we all first need to keep in mind that we just can not have it all in our life, no matter how hard we try. We also need to communicate our problems with our families and the people around us, as frequently as we can, so that we do not feel overburdened with our problems. Finally, we also need to have some time for ourselves so that we can do some physical exercise because physical exercise can also ease pressure on our minds and help us get rid of stress.
	In conclusion, stress is a widespread problem and is primarily caused by our have-it-all expectations and financial problems. To overcome it, we need to be realistic about our expectations, spend prudently, communicate our issues with others, and do some physical activities regularly.

Essay 48:
	Adolescents face several challenges on their path to adulthood and successful career. And it becomes even more difficult for school-leavers as sorting their ways out in the employment market seems to be the immediate obstacle they encounter. Besides, other social and family issues often hurt them, and this essay shed some light on the topic.
	Regarding the problems fresh school graduates face, the most acute is the scepticism harboured by employers over hiring them. It seems to be the reason behind the high unemployment rates in many countries, especially in third-world countries where managing a job by a school leaver is exceptionally difficult. Employers usually look for experienced workers who possess practical skills and at least a college degree. Hence, school graduates with no prior experience are often placed at the bottom of the shortlist. For instance, due to unemployment, many university graduates apply for simple clerical jobs, which makes the scenario for school-leavers even more baffling.
	Moreover, limited job prospect is another big problem for them. Even the school-leavers are lucky enough to secure a job, they have to work long hours with low wages. They often do not have sufficient time and money to pursue higher academic qualifications needed for career progression. Consequently, they are trapped in lower positions with limited social mobility.
	Sadly, young people are not only challenged by employment problems. They may consistently live under the threat of political instability, social unrest, sexual and racial discrimination, and child marriage - all of which are beyond their control. These risks pose actual threats to the physical safety of youngsters in addition to their livelihoods.
	To conclude, unemployment is one of the major problems for young people, especially for school-leavers. However, the lack of safety, social unrest, and discriminations are also serious problems for them in parts of the world.
Essay 49:
	Unemployment is a significant challenge in many parts of the world today, but it is not the biggest challenge to school-leavers in most countries. So, I disagree with the idea of the essay. Here, I will also outline other serious challenges that are faced by young people today. 
	School-leavers are young people who are generally very optimistic and enthusiastic about joining the professional world, but they are also generally very inexperienced at the same time about the realities of life as well as the professional world. In many cases, these school-leavers do not also have the necessary skills, aptitude and acumen, needed to enter or compete in the job market. But, once these school-leavers receive some proper training and experience, related to the available jobs, getting a job suddenly does not remain such a big challenge anymore. 
	In conclusion, unemployment is a big challenge, but not the biggest challenge for school-leavers. Deciding on important directions in life and staying away from bad friends and bad habits are much more challenging for them.
Essay 50:
	The unemployment rate among youngsters who have recently finished school is a major concern in many countries. In my view, finding the first job is a herculean task, and the most challenging perhaps, for such youngsters just after their school graduation. As a result, many of them remain unemployed. So I agree with the opinion offered.
	To begin with, the modern job pool is extremely competitive. Employers are looking for candidates with a renowned diploma as well as considerable experience. Thus, just a school certificate and some training courses cannot guarantee employment for adolescents in most countries. This is why unemployment is still the biggest problem that fresh school graduates have to face. To illustrate, more than 66% of school-leavers in many subcontinent regions remain unemployed because they are not eligible to apply for better jobs and due to the lack of suitable jobs for them in the job market.
	Besides unemployment, school-leavers often face family pressure and money insufficiency that they cannot avoid. According to the research conducted by the Bureau of Statistics, one of the major social issues for fresh school leavers is the expectations from their family to support them, especially in needy families. The research reveals that such youngsters were ready to work extra hours or find a not-so-suitable part-time job just to support their families. But getting a decent job was tremendously challenging.
	In conclusion, youngsters face several difficulties after they complete school education, such as family pressure and the shortage of money. However, the most challenging task for them, in my opinion, is finding their first stable job.

Essay 51:
	Sound health plays an indispensable role in our life and work performance. That is why many employers seek ways to offer perks, such as gyms or sports clubs sponsorship, with a belief that healthier and happier employees will become more productive at work while many other employers simply do not invest in it. The essay will examine both sides, but I personally believe that various other motivations and rewards, in combination with this initiative, will bring effective results.
	The proponent of gyms or sports club subsidies offered by employers believes that physical and mental wellness is a prerequisite for optimal work performance. It is evident that sportive people are less likely to get sick, take fewer sick leaves and hence bring the least disruptions to daily operations in their workplace. Furthermore, sport is a good way to build team spirit and promote interpersonal skills. Thus the harmonious professional relationship that results from workers hitting the gyms or playing sports will certainly facilitate work efficacy. Moreover, sports club sponsorship by companies will implicitly convey the message that employers care about the wellness of their employees. Perhaps, employees will pay extra effort at work if they are valued. For instance, some of my friends speak highly of their employers because they feel their office authority takes care of their well-being by offering the facility to hit the gym.
	Conversely, the opponent of gyms or sports facility funding says that companies should focus on incentives that really matter to employees instead, namely job prospects, pay increments, job satisfaction, training opportunities, reasonable workloads and holidays. If employees’ performances are directly linked to their pay increments or career progression, they should have enough tangible rewards to work effectively. Likewise, if workers are able to identify meaningful goals or get job satisfaction, they should have intrinsic motivation to excel at work. To give an example, studies show that employees work more dedicatedly when they are motivated and are awarded rather than having facilities like gyms.
	In conclusion, I believe that gyms or sports clubs membership offered by the office is one of many effective motivations for some employees to work efficiently at work. But for many others, monetary or other tangible or intangible rewards are more useful. It is expected that employers will provide a range of extrinsic and intrinsic motivators that will promote productivity at work.
Essay 52:
	These days, some employers think that a healthier crew of staff means more productivity and more revenue for their business while others think that it brings no benefit to them. In this essay, I will discuss both views, but personally, I am in favour of the former view.
	On an average, workers may spend up to three-quarters of their day sitting down on their desks to get their job done as best and fast as they can except, of course, they do not know that such “marathon attachment to their desks and chairs” can contribute to a range of preventable health conditions, like back injuries and stress, depression or anxiety. Now, this information alone should be enough of a reason for the employers to motivate their employees to get involved with some sort of physical or gym activities. But, in case, if it does not, then they should consider that according to a UK government report on May 8, 2018, published by its “Department for digital, culture, media & sports, in the year 2017, just over 1.3 million workers suffered from work-related ill-health, which equated to 25.7 million working days lost.
	Of course, those, who do not care much about the health of their employees, suggest that health and fitness can not be spoon-fed. They are correct to some extent because our lifestyle is often a choice that we make. They also argue that if someone does not take any initiative on his or her own to improve his or her health, then the chances are that the initiatives on the part of a company would not also really make much of a difference.
	In conclusion, the opponents of promoting better health for employees may have a point or two, but that does not necessarily mean that employers should not try to take some sort of initiative to make their employees healthier. And the sooner, the employers take such initiatives, the better will it fare for their businesses.

Essay 53:
	The covid-19 pandemic has shattered the world to its core, and ongoing wars in different regions have brought us to the verge of a large-scale war more devastating than any time in human history. Thus the world is facing numerous challenges on top of its regular problems like global warming, overpopulation and poverty. My country, I believe, will face economic challenges and the possibility to get involved in a war in the next ten years.
	The global economy has been hit hard by the ongoing pandemic, restrictions, wars, and recessions. My country, in particular, relies on imports more heavily than its exports. As a result, the foreign currency reserve may shrink in the future, making it more difficult to import necessary fuels and goods from other countries. It will surely have negative consequences on our economy. Moreover, our job market is likely to become more unstable due to the challenges faced by the businesses. Besides, the world is watching appalling and devastating wars, and many countries, including ours, have a possibility to get involved in a war in the next few years. If this happens, the fate of our country is bleak.
	To address the upcoming economic problems of our country, the authority has to take diverse initiatives to strengthen our export industries. They can offer incentives to export-oriented companies, for example, to achieve that. They should also take measures to increase our foreign reserves so that we do not get trapped in a situation where we will fail to import necessary foods and medicines for the lack of foreign currency. One way to achieve that is to restrict the amount someone from our country can spend on a foreign tour from now on. To avoid wars and regional conflicts, our leaders have to take part in friendly discussions with their counterparts instead of their hot rhetorics. We must understand that it is not a time to get involved in a war when millions of people are suffering from the ongoing pandemic and recession.  
	In conclusion, our country has to act prudently to avoid economic crisis and wars by all means as these two are the greatest threat ahead of us.

Essay 55:
	Governments, environmentalists and large organisations, in many countries, are trying to curb environmental problems, and a part of this effort is to make people aware of environmental issues. It is surprising how our dietary habits or even the dresses we wear can all contribute to environmental problems. So, without involving ordinary citizens, government bodies and private organisations can not reverse the downward fall when it comes to the environment.
	To commence with, without creating awareness among ordinary citizens, it is impossible to achieve environmental protection. We, as ordinary citizens, are constantly contributing to global warming, pollution and climate change. To illustrate, the cars we drive exhaust carbon dioxide, the dresses we wear require a large amount of fibres and water, the plastic bags we use end up in the water, and even the diets we follow can impact the climate. Thus, if people are not cognizant of their actions that are directly or indirectly responsible for global warming, they will not fully comprehend the gravity of the intricacies and feel responsible. Climate change is so big a problem that only governments and large organizations can not work to find a solution, and a coordinated effort is required.
	It is undeniable that countries have taken serious steps to curb environmental problems, and our leaders meet frequently to discuss it. Restrictions are in place on gas emissions, fossil fuel use, plastic production and use, and alternative sources of green energy are being invested upon. But if the efforts are not made at an individual level, the magnitude of damage and pollution would far outstrip the efforts. To cite an example, scientists, engineers, environmentalists and the authority may come out with proposals and invest money in research, but they can not control the amount of plastic bags we use and throw away without recycling. Every environmental problem is related to our human lifestyle and unconsciousness, so it is high time to include the syllabus about environmental protection in our school. We have got only one planet to live on, and we must save it.
	In conclusion, whatever we do to the environment will return and affect us. So all levels of education should emphasize how we can be more responsible in protecting it. A joint approach by the authority and mass people can only make it happen.
Essay 56:
	Nowadays, environmental issues have become bigger and more crucial than at any time in the past. Some believe that authorities, large firms and manufacturers can play a fundamental role in reversing the detrimental damages done to the environment while ordinary people have little to contribute. From my perspective, although the government and large companies must take immediate actions to save the earth, people have an important role to play.
	The earth is confronting devastating threats, and it is imperative to take some radical moves by the authorities immediately. For example, authorities should dedicate a large amount of budget to improve the public transport infrastructures and enact strict regulations and laws regarding usage or ownership of private vehicles. They generate a considerable volume of greenhouse gases, which are considered the main culprit behind global warming. Moreover, it should be compulsory for companies to be based on renewable resources of energy for their productions. Also, they should limit their productions to the proportion of demand because mass production not only threatens the natural resources but is also primarily responsible for endless rubbish and harmful pollutants that overwhelmingly harm nature.
	In addition to the actions required by the government and organisations, people need to be active in saving the mother planet. Little choices they make can have a big impact. To cite an instance, the way we dispose of our household waste can make a difference. If we separate the biodegradable and non-biodegradable garbage from the origin, from homes, it will effectively reduce the recycling strain, which is profoundly time, money, and energy-consuming. Furthermore, the more they become aware of the environment and understand how crucial it is to protect it, the more sustainable and healthier the world becomes.
	In conclusion, governments and large companies must initiate immediate and radical actions for the sake of the earth's survival, and people still can play a significant role in diverse aspects of the earth's well-being.
Essay 57:
	Every country in the world is suffering from some sort of environmental crisis, which is exacerbating each year. In my view, individual effort is less significant in reducing such damages; hence, the government, international organisations and big corporations should come forward to tackle this ever-increasing global warming and environmental issues.
	Environmental damage is an intricate issue that primarily results from careless industrialisation. Most factories release chemicals into the environment without any treatment and emit CO2. So, they are liable for such devastating environmental degradation, and they should pay all the money to reinstate the environment. To give an example, according to the World Economic Forum, industrial wastes are the key reason for the contemporary ecological collapse, and it comprises 70% of the world’s pollutions. Since industries are primarily responsible for global warming, they should be made liable to invest to reverse it.
	Moreover, pollution is wreaking havoc in all countries. As countries are inextricably connected, they can not deny their duties to resolve the issue. When the iceberg in Antarctica melts, it increases the risks of floods in the lower sea-level countries like Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and the Maldives. Interestingly, 80% of global warming is happening due to excessive fuel usages in developed countries. So rich countries should reduce their fuel consumption to limit the global temperature rise so that other countries become free from any environment-related jeopardies. Governments, international organisations and large corporations have the means and capacity to tackle it internationally, and ordinary people can do little to enact international laws or take effective initiatives to reverse the damage done.
	In conclusion, the intensity of the environmental damages has reached its peak, so individual efforts cannot change it significantly. In fact, large organizations and governments should resolve the issue because they are responsible for most of the damages, and they have the means to control it.
Essay 58:
	Humans have been degrading the earth ever since we realised our capability to harness nature. As a result, we are facing environmental issues that have gone beyond our control. Despite coordinated efforts by environmentalists and governments, the downward spiral has hardly been reversed. And, environmental problems are not only the liability of the government and big organisations, but it is also everyone’s duty to protect, nurture and care for the mother earth.
	To begin with, problems associated with the environment today are getting worse, and the earth is being polluted not only because of large industries or factories but also because of us - ordinary people. Every action we, as ordinary citizens, take also has an impact on our environment. For example, the use of plastic is a common cause of environmental contamination and no matter how many times the government bans the use of plastic, the havoc it causes to the environment will not stop unless mass people stop using it. We have to realise how significant it is to protect our environment, and deciding to carry bags made from fibres or biodegradable materials could be an initial step.
	Moreover, the government can not decide to stop industrialisation as that would severely hamper a country's GDP. On top of that, large corporations are mostly after their business profit rather than caring for the environment. So if we rely on such organisations to reverse the damage caused to nature, we would only be imprudent in the long run. We need to step forward and vow to save the only planet we have for us and our future generation. For instance, large organisations or the local authority can plant trees to a certain extent, and it will not have a drastic impact unless and until people start planting trees in their spare space and on the rooftop.
	To conclude, considering the increase in overall environmental damages in recent years, the earth will become inhabitable soon. To save our planet and the human race from becoming extinct, we all should join our hands together and work towards the common goal of reducing the damage to our environment.

Essay 59:
	Fossil fuel, though extensively used, is not eco-friendly, and its usage comes with huge environmental costs. Considering global warming and climate change, and the detrimental effects fossil fuels have on the environment and public health, green fuel, such as solar, hydro and wind power, could be the answer to our future energy demand. It is a good thing that many countries have already started using these green power sources.
	The demand for fuels is rapidly increasing in many countries with the population rise. It is also associated with industrialisation, and it seems only obvious that oil, coal and natural gas-rich countries would largely use them to take the leverage of their stock of such energy sources. For instance, Russia has natural gas, China and India are rich in coal, and the USA and OPEC countries have a huge stockpile of oil. Besides, other developed countries that do not have a huge stock of such fuel, import them from other countries at a considerably cheap price. However, the stock of fossil fuel is limited and would get exhausted at a certain point. So, alternative and green sources, which is renewable, would be the main source of our energy in the future, and we should get ready for the time when we will have no new oil or gas stock. Since green energy like wind and solar energy is renewable, their use should be as much encouraged as possible from right now, and it is a good thing that the trend has already started.
	Alternative sources of power, such as solar and wind power, do not pollute the environment, have lower carbon emissions and are eco-friendly. So their use could save the planet from the disaster of global warming which is already visible around us. Wind power and solar power are in use in countries like Denmark, Germany and France, and more and more countries are joining the list. We already have an extremely efficient technology to produce solar and wind power, and the trend is quite encouraging.
	To conclude, the energy demand is increasing at a fast pace, and the stock of fossil fuels is diminishing. So we should turn to alternative green energy sources and share the technology and expertise with all nations so that the transition happens all around the world to save our otherwise dying planet due to climate change and greenhouse effects.
Essay 60:
	Every year the energy demand is increasing globally. So the strains on the current and already limited resources are high, and most of these energy resources, like fossil fuels, harm our environment one way or another. So I wholeheartedly believe that the use of alternative sources of energy is a positive trend, and their use should be encouraged further.
	To solve the global energy demand and environmental problems, we need answers to questions like how to better use the existing, limited fossil fuel resources, and how we can encourage the use of alternative energy sources. Fossil fuels, like coal and oil, are not an unlimited source of energy. Some countries are rich in oil deposits like OPEC, whereas others have coal deposits or natural gas. And a few others, Germany and Japan, for example, are completely dependent on the import of such resources. For all these countries, alternative energy, also known as green energy, should be encouraged and utilised to reduce the dependence on fossil fuels as well as to keep the global environment in balance and ‘healthy’. The trend of producing green energy is thus a timely initiative to save our planet from climate change and global warming.
	To turn the situation in our favour, we have to introduce clean energy supplies that would not harm the environment and would be feasible for most countries to produce. Wind power and solar power are at present seem to be the perfect alternatives for that. Countries like France and Norway, among others, have the advanced technology needed to produce extremely efficient solar panels to store energy from the sun or produce win power. Both kinds of power can reduce a country’s dependence on fossil fuels, so their use is, no doubt, a very positive trend.
	In conclusion, the use of solar and wind power to produce energy does not pollute the environment and in turn, helps keep the ecosystem stable. So they should be treated positively, and their mass use encouraged.
Essay 61:
	These days, the environment is being severely affected by the excessive use of nonrenewable energy resources, such as petrol, diesel, coal and natural gas. However, eco-friendly and renewable power sources like wind and solar power are being adopted in many countries, and I wholeheartedly think that it is a positive trend.
	To begin with, many nations have already made a firm decision to regain the balance of our planet. To achieve that, they have made significant modifications to their system. Firstly, the implementation of windmills and hydroelectric plants is gaining popularity at a rapid pace. This is a secure way of generating electricity that saves the environment and money and leads the way to a future when clean energy will be predominant in the world. For instance, Croatia is setting an example for its neighbouring countries by generating seventy per cent of its energy from solar power. It is a very positive development that other countries can follow to make the world green again.
	Additionally, the major advantage of utilising these alternative resources is that they greatly reduce the carbon content of the environment and make the planet more sustainable. Moreover, it is cheaper to produce such clean energy than to extract coal or natural gas which makes these eco-friendly energies affordable to mass people. A recent study by Oxford University reveals that the production of solar power is 30% cheaper than that of fossil fuel. This finding again emphasizes how important it is for all nations to opt for renewable energy sources, and how beneficial it is that many countries have already invested in generating clean power.
	In conclusion, even though we have harmed Mother Nature to a great extent by indiscriminately using fossil fuels, some countries have already shown us a better way to produce and use power. It is expected that more countries will invest in alternative sources of energy to make the planet green again and make energy affordable for all.

Essay 62:
	Personal cars have become an essential part of our life due to a variety of benefits it offers including easy access to different facilities and services, safety, freedom to travel, and comfort of the journey. However, these advantages come with a cost, and among them, environmental degradation and traffic congestion are two major concerns. We can improve the public transportation system and gradually increase fuel prices to discourage people from using private cars while also investing in eco-friendly cars.
	Problems associated with increasing car use are huge, and its environmental impacts are a great concern for many.  Automobiles are a big source of carbon dioxide emission and greenhouse effects and not to mention, air and sound pollutions in urban areas all around the world. Vehicle exhausts contribute to global warming, acid rain and many health-related problems. Climate change is already affecting millions of people's lives and hurting the ecological balance, and it is terrifying to think about what the ever-increasing vehicles on the roads would do to our planet in the future unless we do something to reverse it. Moreover, personal cars are the reason we face horrendous traffic jam almost every day which kills our valuable time and negatively affect our productivity.
	To address these problems, some people suggest that the government should impose strict restrictions on car ownership and increase the tax on car purchasing to a staggering height. However, the mobility and flexibility of personal cars are essential in our life, and I am absolutely against taking any drastic measures. Rather, we should improve our public transportation facility to a great extent so that people prefer to use public buses and trains rather than driving. Another measure could be slowly increasing the fuel price that would deter many people from using and driving cars. Moreover, car manufacturers should invest in environment-friendly solar or hydrogen-powered cars to reduce the negative impacts of cars on the environment and the government should improve the roads to reduce traffic congestion.
	In conclusion, restricting the use of cars overnight might seem like a quick and effective solution, but practically speaking, it is not a proper solution. We want to use cars for the freedom of our mobility but have to come with eco-friendly cars to reduce their negative impacts.

Essay 63:
	Access to the internet is easy in the modern era, and we can quickly get the latest news on our electronic devices - thanks to modern technology. Although I believe many journalists are honest and have genuine integrity to their responsibility and ethics, we cannot blindly trust all of them.
	In this digital age, competition in the journalism industry is fierce. In order to stay ahead in the business, some journalists may present news which they did not double-check or reports that lacks originality. It is also true that some journalists make clickbait news to attract attention from the public, which enables them to get payback from internet traffic. Therefore, how to distinguish reliable information is becoming increasingly vital for us because we cannot rely on every news or the reporter behind the news. For example, it is reported that five out of twenty pieces of news could be clickbait when we read news randomly from unverified news aggregation sites or social media.
	Having said that, we still have many honest journalists who present the truth to their readers and have courage and integrity. They take their profession as a responsibility to the people and are not scared of danger and threats. They even take risks and carry on tough jobs to show the truth to the audience. Such journalists are doing excellent jobs to make the world a better place. To give an example, journalists who travel to war-torn areas to give us the real picture of the event, or do investigative reports to publish corruption are doing commendable jobs.  
	In conclusion, we can do some cross-checking to make sure the news we read is reliable, because, in this day and age, fake news is ubiquitous. Numerous outstanding journalists are still working to reveal the fact to the ordinary public, but we should not trust every journalist as not all of them remain true to their duty and morality.
Essay 64:
	Due to the emergence of technology, we have online news portals besides the printed newspapers, and it seems like anybody can be a journalist with a dot com website which puts an already questionable profession under more scrutiny and doubts. While trusting journalists and their reports, we should always verify the authenticity of the news and use our common sense.
	Without reading newspapers and watching the news, we will be unaware of the world around us, and that is why newspapers play such a profound role in enhancing our knowledge. People who constantly work hard to bring that news and information to us are doing a tremendous job and they are often the reason we learn about corruption, global crisis, updates on an important national issue, and even the score of our favourite sports team. A responsible and honest journalist is like a soldier who fights a righteous battle to keep the citizens informed and eliminate corruption and unjust from society. However, not all of them are true to their responsibilities, and many of them put business and personal gains over ethics and responsibilities.
	When trusting a news report or a journalist, thus, we should always check the news source and the credibility of the reporter, especially in this era of modern technology where online news portals have grown and spread like mushrooms. Clickbait journalism and politically motivated news are constantly bombarding us with the help of social media, and they have primarily one goal in mind - making money by playing with our emotions and feelings. As informed readers, we must rely on authoritative newspapers and verify any news source before believing them. For example, I generally tend to believe the news I read on bbc.com, but sometimes I also check the news on other sources. Our common sense about news can be a big tool to filter out the fabricated news as we should read the truth even if it is something we dislike rather than reading false news which is exactly what we want to hear or believe.
	To conclude, we have good journalists and bad journalists, and it is our responsibility to be wary of non-authoritative news and not-so-credible journalists. We should also use our common sense to read news which is based on facts and truth.

Essay 65:
	There has been a colossal upsurge in prodigies discussing the topic of appropriate school-going age for children. While many of them believe that toddlers should start school as early as possible, others think that they should stay home until they turn six or seven. I, wholeheartedly, agree with the latter view.
	Many parents want their infants to join a school early, sometimes at 4 or 5 years old, so that they learn the fundamental things as soon as possible. Undoubtedly, this is the age when a child's cognitive development occurs at a full pace, and schools are expected to provide them ample opportunities to learn and grab new things as compared to home. In schools, these young children will learn important subjects like "Mathematics" or "English" as well as other essential behaviours and ethical aspects. It will help in shaping their future.
	On the flip side, children till the age of six or seven should spend time with their parents at home as they learn what they see, play with, or observe. In other words, they cannot distinguish between good and bad habits, and can be misguided easily at school by peers. In addition to this, pressure in schools may restrict their ability to play freely and learn from their surroundings. Schools are often accused of restricting freedom and following strict rules which is not a positive way of teaching young children. A recent survey in Washington has revealed that many school education policies put too much emphasis on formal learning and rob children of their creative abilities.
	To recapitulate, despite some benefits of starting school early, I think infants should not be sent to school until the age of six or seven to protect them from learning bad habits, while also providing them with more independence to cherish their childhood and learn naturally.

Essay 66:
	Traditionally, a library is a place that shelves many books that readers can read or borrow. However, technological advancement and its tremendous effects on the way we learn new things and share information have redefined the concept of a library in recent days. Thus digital content and technological facilities are widely used in public libraries all around the world, and I quite disagree with the notion that these amenities are a waste of resources or space for a library.
	Opposers of high-tech libraries often argue that they distract readers and costs additional money. I, however, believe that libraries with modern facilities are far more useful to readers, and allow the librarian to manage its collection in a more organised fashion. Multimedia resources offer readers a dynamic combination of images, sounds, videos and virtual tours. Thus listening to a famous historical speech or taking a virtual tour at a historical site is far more interactive and exciting than just reading about them. Moreover, multimedia facilities and DVDs in a library may initially seem expensive, but they preserve valuable resources for a longer time and contain important information for future research and reference. To cite an example, a single DVD can store the entire volume of Encyclopedia Britannica which would otherwise occupy a large shelf of a library.
	Interestingly, a public library can actually save money and space and attract more readers with the use of technology and interactive contents. When they have computers and library management software, they barely need many staff members. Besides, it takes great effort to protect books from moisture, fire and human damages but digital contents can easily be copied and preserved for as many years as we want. As for attracting young generations, a high-tech library is more successful.
	To conclude, the transformation of public libraries have made them more beneficial to readers and researchers as they now work as centres for interactive learning and knowledge sharing. It is expected that traditional libraries would start including digital and modern facilities to enhance human knowledge and experience.

Essay 67:
	Ever since we realised our power to harness nature, we have started utilising it to make our life comfortable and more convenient. However, we then began to over-utilise this authority and damage nature to an extent that is catastrophic. Global warming and environmental pollutions are threatening our very existence on this planet, but we are neglecting our obligations to protect the environment. This is primarily because we fail to realise the real consequences of it and believe that it can be dealt with in the future.
	The first reason for this is our incompetency to understand the dire consequences of climate change. Despite frequent headlines on TV and in newspapers all over the world, for instance, we are still oblivious to the fate of the world. We work hard to save some money to build a house or have a car in the future, but we cannot fathom how many parts of the world would become unlivable due to global warming and pollutions.
	Another reason we are indifferent towards environmental degradation is our false confidence that it could be dealt with in the future. As a result, we are more concerned about solving more immediate problems such as housing shortage or traffic congestion than preventing the disaster that is only predicted to happen in the future. For instance, many individuals still believe that the rate of environmental degradation and global warming is not as severe as they are reported in the media, and technology that we will develop in the future would control it easily.
	These beliefs and attitudes are obviously mistaken and we need to act now to control the damage. The youngsters must be taught their obligations to preserve nature in schools and encouraged to plant more trees. Besides, the government should adopt strict laws that would prohibit citizens from using disposable goods that are harmful to the environment. Finally, the government can encourage people to make the environment greener by offering tax incentives and other benefits.
	To conclude, if we do not want to make our mother planet an unhabitable and barren place, we need to concede the real danger of climate change and act prudently to save it for us and our future generations.

Essay 68:
	Many people contemplate their salary as the most salient feature of their job while others believe that their contributions to society through their professions hold more importance. In my opinion, a job should have ethical demands and needs to be passion-oriented. Otherwise, it would be futile to work merely for wages.
	Let us first examine why passion is a prominent part of people's professional life. No doubt, passion acts as the fuel that drives people to withstand the caustic side of their work. If people chose a job that is not connected to their passion, they will fall victim to depression and perform poorly at their jobs. On the other hand, if we examine successful people's stories, we would find that almost all of them have been in the career that they were passionate about. Suppose Bill Gates or Steve Jobs, both of them were tech enthusiasts, and therefore took technology as the means of their career.
	Besides, a job needs to be ethically demanding where people need to find something to do for humanity and society. Doing something for people not only will provide mental satisfaction but also will strengthen the purpose of their job life. Take Mother Theresa or Nelson Mandala for an example. Both of them are highly admired for their works for humanity and they did their best because they knew they were doing something for others and to make the world a better place.
	To conclude, salary is somewhat important for people to support their expenses but if they do not feel attached to their work, they will feel exhausted in their life. They will also be suppressed by the undue pressure that could have been avoided if they had the passion and ethical context in their job.
Essay 69:
	We cannot deny that we work to earn money so that we can put food on the table for the family. However, we also look for job satisfaction, growth opportunity and social recognition from our careers.
	Salary is important because without money we will not be working for a company at all. Some people are always after money and do not hesitate to change their job if they are offered a higher salary. However, to others, job satisfaction is equally important as it ensures work-life balance. Many people would not compromise their job satisfaction for the money they are offered. Many top executives, who resign from large corporations in order to work for smaller companies or run their own companies, are great examples of how much they value job satisfaction over the wages they earn.
	Moreover, "growth opportunities" is another aspect people often expect in their careers. A moderate salary and a great career growth aspect are far better than a higher salary and no career growth - according to many professionals, and they are prudent enough to envision the future than to run after only money. Finally, people often want to be in a career that is socially appreciated and valued. For example, a few of my colleagues left high-paid private jobs to take government jobs only because that would give them social recognition, and I quite understand the rationale for their decisions.
	In conclusion, besides salary, job satisfaction which ensures a work-life balance is also important. Moreover, career growth and social recognition often drive us to choose a job that brings us less money than we could otherwise make from other jobs.

Essay 70:
	Electronic transactions are gradually replacing the traditional banking system and the use of banknotes is being supplanted by credit and debit cards. The transformation toward a cashless society might be slow, but steady and widespread. This paradigm shift has both positive and negative aspects, and this essay deals with both of them.
	Primarily, electronic transactions and plastic card payments are more convenient and are processed on the go. People neither have to carry a bulk amount of cash nor write a check - which usually takes a couple of days to clear the payment. The electronic payment system is global in nature and hassle-free. Consequently, the eCommerce industry has flourished and many individuals have their own online businesses without any brick and mortar shops. For instance, nowadays it has become pretty easy to shop with a VISA or a Master card, virtually from anywhere in the world. Personally, I hate standing in a long queue to pay my utility bills, and my cards let me do it from home - a time saver indeed.
	On the contrary, the trend does not come without negative aspects. Although we can use these cards due to technological advancement, the risks of using plastic money, however, pertain to this technology. The primary threat to such payment mode is cybersecurity and hacking. For example, once a credit card is cloned or its sensitive data is hacked, the owner would suffer a great financial loss. A technology giant like Facebook has failed to protect its user data, for example, and the misuse of user data is a global concern. The same goes for plastic cards and online payment systems that have the same vulnerability.
	To conclude, despite some adverse effects, the use of plastic money for making and receiving payments is the need of the hour. It provides a plethora of advantages but we have to be careful of its use.

Essay 71:
	Many people believe that handwriting skill is no longer important in this era of technology, and children do not require investing time to hone their handwriting, especially when they will most likely type instead of writing for the rest of their life. Unfortunately, this opinion is misguided. I strongly believe that handwriting skill is important even in today’s digital world.
	Good handwriting is important because when children learn to write clearly and concisely, they also learn how to express themselves properly. This leads to better academic and professional performance. I reckon handwriting is much more than simply putting letters on a page; it is a key part of learning and expressing ideas. Scrawls that cannot be read may be compared to speaking that cannot be understood. Handwriting is also important because children are required to use it daily in school, and those who struggle with the mechanics of handwriting may have trouble taking notes or completing their schoolwork. This can affect both their self-esteem and their attitude toward school. Good penmanship means better grades as studies show that the same mediocre paper is graded much higher if the handwriting is neat.
	More importantly, handwriting proficiency inspires confidence despite some people's belief that handwriting is not related to better academic performance. The more children practise a skill such as handwriting, the stronger the motor pathways become until the skill becomes automatic. Furthermore, handwriting aids memory. For example, if a person writes a list or a note and then loses it, he is more likely to remember what he wrote than if he just tries to memorize it.
	In conclusion, computer and digital data have no way replaced the necessity of handwriting skills. They are even more prevalent in this era of technology where good handwriting is related to academic performance and success, on the one hand, and inspires confidence, on the other hand.
Essay 72:
	Handwriting skills involve craftsmanship and an artistic way of presenting letters, and require a great deal of time and practice. Since students are more likely to type rather than write on paper for the rest of their life, I do not believe that this skill is prevalent in this modern era where computers are used both in the academic and professional arenas.
	To begin with, neat handwriting was a criterion for academic success in the past, but not anymore in this digital era. Assignments, classwork, tests and other school activities are mostly done on computers and this is why a student needs to grasp the skills of computing and typing more than presenting immaculate letter formations on paper. To illustrate an example, I  submitted three assignments during my last term and all of them were submitted to my teachers' emails, and not a single one was handwritten. Besides, time invested in honing excellent handwriting can be better utilised in mastering more important subjects and skills.
	Moreover, the use of computers and the Internet in offices is a common trend. An employee is expected to be an expert computer user, and immaculate handwriting is not a requirement to be hired by a company. Ironically, better penmanship has little value in a world surrounded by technology. Considering the future, when computers would be more predominant, parents and teachers should focus more on teaching technology to students than instructing how much a letter should be stressed or curved!
	To conclude, academic activities and professional needs, in this era of technology, compel students to have skills in computers and this is why it would be more practical to enhance their technical skills rather than handwriting skills- which have already become less important.
Essay 73:
	Good handwriting of pupils is one of the essential skills for their academic success. The dominance of technology has changed many people's views on teaching students the art of writing. But I personally disagree that modernisation and the use of technology have made handwriting skills obsolete.
	To begin with, good penmanship leads to better school performance in most cases. Also, it puts a solid impression on the readers or examiners. To exemplify this particular impression, 71 per cent of learners who have clear and nice handwriting, have good academic records and a reputation among schoolmates and teachers.
	However, considering the contrary point of view that good handwriting by children is useless could be justified as the predominant use of technology where most of the writing is done on computers. Moreover, skills in technology should be one’s goal rather than only giving preferences to handwriting.
	Nevertheless, only reading and speaking skills are not enough for better academic performance. Practising the topics by writing them on paper could be a much more efficient way to learn. For example, in mathematics, it is helpful to practice the problems and learn the formulas by writing. Additionally, writing is also a pivotal part of communication and this skill is necessary because research shows that when children learn how to do it, they also learn how to express themselves.
	To conclude, it can be summarized that learning to write is indispensable and should be taught to children. Amid the sea of typed materials and digital data, handwritten materials have their own dominance, hence, handwriting skills should not be ignored.

	Ever since the dawn of industrialisation, the ethnic landscapes of many developed and developing nations have changed remarkably, and several western nations these days have a more heterogeneous population than ever before. It is often cited that this diversification of nationalities makes a country more appealing and leads to expeditious advancements. I completely agree with this view, and this will be shown in this essay by analysing the copiousness of the culture brought in by different nationalities and how a country can utilise the distinct strengths of people from different races and nationalities.
	To begin with, the more diverse the nationalities in a country are, the richer its culture becomes. For instance, people from more than a hundred nationalities reside in Dubai and this leads to the availability of hundreds of different cuisines throughout the country. As a result, Dubai is called the ‘food capital’ of the Middle East. This, in turn, attracts tourists from all over the world who come to explore this richness in culture in Dubai. Hence, the contribution of having an amalgam of diverse types of people makes the culture of a country more intriguing.
	Besides, many researchers agree that people from different countries have different strengths and weaknesses. For example, Singaporeans and other Asians are generally better at math, while Africans are known for their strength. Countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom have harnessed these strengths of people from different races to become global leaders. Therefore, the benefits of having a mixture of citizens in a country’s workforce are obvious.
	To conclude, having a mixture of nationalities leads to the enrichment of cultures and faster advancement of a country. It is expected that more countries will benefit from this phenomenon in the future.
Essay 75:
	Cosmopolitan societies are thought to be more attractive to international tourists due to their diversified cultural aspects, and they are often considered to have a strong economy that develops faster. However, as far as I am concerned, a mixture of nationalities in many countries is still problematic.
	Admittedly, a culturally and ethnically diverse country attracts tourists from all over the world as the amalgamation of different cultures and their traditions, foods and lifestyles give birth to a truly cosmopolitan society. As a result of tourism development, the local economy grows to a certain extent.
	However, countries that include populations from different nationalities and cultures often experience social issues which lead to civil and political unrest and hatred for each other. People from different backgrounds view things differently and have their own opinion about "values". If not dealt with properly, it may cause ethnic conflicts. Iraq or the United States, for example, experienced such hatred for decades. Even worse, in some countries, it divides the nation as citizens start possessing discriminatory attitudes towards minors. If such a situation prevails, the country will soon lose international tourists who might be the main driving force for their economic boost.
	Moreover, the heterogeneous population in a country bring their own culture and thus the country loses its heritage and century-long tradition in the process. As a result, the country can no longer proclaim itself as a unique cultural landscape. For instance, many large cities in the world these days look almost the same and have no distinctive cultural identity.
	To conclude, multi-cultural societies are prone to create many social problems and the government should give priority to solving such issues whenever they emerge so that it does not lead to social unrest and ambivalence situations.
	Essay: A country becomes more interesting and develops more quickly when its population includes a mixture of nationalities.
	To what extent do you agree or disagree?
Essay 76:
	Global migration of people began with soaring industrialization and due to the major global wars. As a result, many developed nations experience the amalgamation of different cultures and traditions. It is often argued that this diversification of nationalities and cultures makes the country more attractive and helps the nation progress faster. I totally agree with this viewpoint.
	First of all, in a country with cross-cultural integrity, public areas, facilities and tourist spots are designed considering all inhabitants including expatriates. Shopping malls, entertainment centres, beaches etc. public places become more appealing and usable. The cities become global towns and bear the mark of truly diverse traditions and cultures. For example, in several countries many nationalities reside together and taking this in mind, a global village is designed for them. Such a global village attracts thousands of tourists around the globe and it claims to be the world's tourism, leisure, shopping and entertainment destination.
	In addition to this, cosmopolitan societies are better for the overall progress of a country. That is perhaps why nations such as the USA, Australia and Canada, which are primarily multi-cultural societies, enjoy greater prosperity, stability and harmony. The transaction between immigrants and residents would quicken the currency circulations and increase the demand for consumption - two essential elements of economic development. Thus a country with different ethnic groups and a diverse culture enjoy quicker progress and cultural richness.
	In conclusion, counties with different cultural backgrounds and nationalities are much more intriguing. It is undeniable that cultural diversity in a country should be considered a welcoming trend for the attractiveness and faster growth of a nation.

Essay 77:
	The most viable solution to the ever-growing traffic problem in urban areas, according to some, is to minimize the citizen's need for travel to workplaces, shopping malls and schools. However, I disagree with this viewpoint.
	First, all professionals can not work from home. Doctors, engineers, bankers, nurses, sales executives and many other professionals have to visit their workplaces and meet people to execute their responsibilities. Similarly, if we shop online, dispatch staff will still be on the road to deliver products. In addition to this, many professional courses require field studies and laboratory work and an online course cannot provide such facilities. Online courses cannot be compared with classroom teaching and the quality of the products cannot be judged just by the pictures on a laptop or a phone. Thus people need to get outside to do their daily work. Furthermore, if somebody is confined to one place for a long to avoid being outside for their daily needs and professional duties, he or she may develop physical and psychological problems.
	To truly tackle traffic congestion, we need more realistic solutions than restricting people's movement. One such solution can be improving public transportation. The convenience of public conveyance would discourage many to use their private cars, which is the primary reason for bad traffic in many cities. Furthermore, the government can encourage people to use an eco-friendly mode of transport, like the bicycle, by dedicating a separate lane for them. Many European and Asian cities, for example, already have separate cycle lanes and this has been truly effective in promoting environment-friendly vehicles and reducing traffic congestion.
	In conclusion, in order to minimize traffic jams, the authority should enhance mass transportation facilities and encourage people to use eco-friendly transport rather than planning to restrict people's movements.
Essay 78:
	Urbanization has brought the term traffic congestion into existence. A school of thought believes that traffic can only be controlled by limiting daily commuters' need for travel. However, I am not convinced that this is the only or the best way. Though it has some impact, other measures are required.
	Apparently, reasons that substantiate the claim that "the less frequently people travel in a city, the fewer traffic jam they create" - require thorough analysis. Firstly, city dwellers commute daily primarily for their study, business, job, shopping and social needs. Some of these could be done from home as the advancement of technology has made it possible to learn, work and shop online. This will reduce traffic to a certain extent. To illustrate, a survey conducted by the Australian Traffic Authority outlines that 75% of commuters in private cars travel for shopping, job and education, and it is clear that if people can work from home, do online shopping and enrol in online courses, traffic congestion would be reduced, if not solved.
	However, working from home is not permissible for a great number of professionals such as nurses, builders, doctors, police and so on. Therefore, they must travel to and from their workplaces daily. Moreover, online learning cannot replace the classroom-based education system, and online shopping is yet to substitute the traditional shopping method. Thus it is evident that controlling the necessity of travel for the day-to-day activities of citizens is not the only way to manage traffic problems. Improving public transportation, carpooling and encouraging pedestrians and cyclists could be some great solutions.
	To conclude, limiting city dwellers' needs for their daily commute may help control traffic problems to some extent, but other measures should be in place. The government should encourage people to use eco-friendly transportations to tackle both bad traffic and pollution.
Essay 79:
	Traffic congestion is perhaps a curse in many cities, and it kills valuable time on the one hand and degrades people's overall productivity and economic progress on the other hand. Since the main reason for traffic gridlocks on the roads is the overwhelming number of people who commute daily, limiting it to a reasonable extent is conceivably the best solution to curb the bad traffic.
	Admittedly, the government and city administration cannot ask citizens to stay indoors and arrange the "work from home" facility for every professional as making it a regulation would create confusion and discontent. Moreover, people need to get outside not only for their professional, shopping and educational needs but also to socialise. Thus restricting people's need to commute daily seems like an unrealistic idea to many.
	However, there are ways to implement it without creating confusion and dissatisfaction among citizens and curbing traffic problems at the same time. Since we need to reduce the number of commuters and vehicles on the road, which is the only viable solution to traffic problems, we can sort out the professionals who can work from home and then distribute the facilities like shopping centres, parks and banks to all residential areas so that people can get them within walking distance. For instance, IT professionals, lawyers, bookkeepers, customer service representatives, instructors and similar other professionals do not need to travel to their office daily as they can execute most of their responsibilities from home with the help of technology.
	Moreover, improving some facilities and digitalising many services can deter people from unnecessary daily commuting. For instance,  many parents travel to their children's school daily to drop them off and pick them up. If schools offer safe and convenient transportation facilities, parents would rely on such facilities rather than travelling daily. Similarly, banking, utility bill payment and help desk should be digitalised so that we can complete our tasks from home rather than visiting those offices.
	To conclude, traffic congestion in many cities is so big a problem that the authority is struggling to keep it under control. A large number of commuters and the vehicles they use are the primary reason for that, and it is expected that the government would facilitate people so that they need to commute less frequently.

Essay 80:
	Museums and art exhibits have long been at the forefront of preserving and representing cultural values and histories, being utilized by almost all countries throughout the centuries. However, whether they should mainly represent local cultures or display an international collection is open to dispute. I personally believe that traditional museums should focus on outlining the cultural aspects and artworks of the country while having separate museums with items from other countries does not hurt the national feeling.
	Educating people about the history and traditions of a country is the primary reason we have museums in the first place. They conserve important cultural specimens, artefacts, artworks and other items to boast about our past and help researchers dig deeper into history. Such museums, which primarily signify our tradition, should comprise things we, as a nation, can be proud of, rather than having internationally acclaimed artworks or sculptures. For instance, many national museums in Europe solely focus on preserving artefacts and artworks from the country and they are quite popular among international tourists.
	Having said that, the concept of a museum, in the modern era, has changed to a great extent. We now have aviation museums, war memorials, motor museums, computer museums, archaeological museums and the list goes on. To make these types of museums popular and useful, we have to have international collections. For instance, the Motor Museum in Australia has a collection from more than 20 countries and they serve their purpose just fine. Museums with international compilations often attract tourists and can be a great way to promote tourism.
	To conclude, national and traditional museums should focus on nurturing national history and heritage but we also need museums with international collections to make them more functional and famous. One does not necessarily diminish the necessity and usefulness of the other.
Essay 81:
	Museums and art galleries help visitors better understand the role of history, showcase important artworks, and preserve important collections at the same time. But many people opine that the collection should include only the artefacts and artworks of the host country. I disagree with this opinion since art is a medium to express thoughts and ideas beyond boundaries, and the history of nations is interconnected.
	Admittedly, museums and art exhibits exist to foster a better understanding of the importance of historical artefacts and arts in our lives and that is why national pride and archives should be emphasised to teach people their national history. But art is an important medium of free expression, and history extends beyond the border. So the collection of a museum should not be confined to geographical boundaries. For example, "Mona Lisa" is a legendary artwork by Leonardo Da Vinci who was an Italian artist in the 15th century. Despite being Italian, Da Vinci is an iconic genius for the whole world. Mona Lisa is now preserved at the Louvre Museum in France, and having this artwork and many other famous international paintings and sculptures, France can only boast of its fine collection that showcases masterpieces, great artworks and world history to the global audience.
	Moreover, history is not confined within boundaries and if this was the case, we would have taught our students only our national history. The fate of nations was interconnected throughout history and it still is. So when we want to teach our children about our history, we must teach them about international events. Since one of the primary objectives of museums is to teach people about history, they must have artworks and collections from the international arena. Finally, when we display artefacts and works from foreign countries, we are connecting nations all over the world. Each culture has something new to teach and the cultural richness of a nation depends on how they accept a new culture. From this perspective, having museums that comprise collections only from the host country is a bad idea.
	To conclude, museums and art galleries that have international artefacts and artworks besides having national collections are far rich and practical in exchanging cultural aspects and showcasing history.
Essay 82:
	Museums and art galleries essentially showcase significant histories and artworks to the general audience both to educate them and to preserve important artefacts. Though some people advocate for an international collection in such important places, I firmly believe that local works and national history should always get the highest priority.
	To begin with, a single museum can not represent all the important histories of the world due to space and budget issues, and the organisers of public art galleries need an exorbitant amount of money to display famous foreign artworks or sculptures. Thus, a museum should focus on becoming a place where people would learn about their own history and culture rather than being a place where they would wonder what the collections are all about. Visitors of a museum or an art gallery, which even include schoolgoers, should be able to relate the items they see so that they get inspired to foster nationalism and learn about their country, heritage and culture.
	Moreover, museums and art exhibits are frequently visited by foreigners who want to get a glimpse of the local culture and history rather than seeing items that they have already seen in other museums perhaps in some other countries. So museums and similar other places become more acceptable when they conserve local culture and present national history. For instance, most of the tourists in my country find the national museum more interesting than other museums we have because our national museum offers a true insight into our past and heritage. Finally, preserving national history and artefacts in a museum and encouraging aspiring local artists makes more sense.
	To conclude, museums and art galleries have significant roles in teaching people about their past and nurturing the talents of enthusiastic artists. It is more important that they have local collections and not foreign relics and arts which have little or no meaning to people who visit them.
Essay 83:
	Some people insist that museums and art exhibitions ought to focus on showing local works to visitors instead of artefacts and artworks from overseas. I, however, disagree with this notion and believe that exhibitions of a wider range of artworks, including foreign ones, are quite beneficial to local people and culture.
	The primary reason I disagree that museums and art centres should concentrate mainly on displaying local artworks is that it restricts the opportunities for spectators and artists to watch, enjoy and learn about diversified global artworks. Diversification helps citizens learn and appreciate various artworks which eventually enrich the culture of a nation. Since local museums are perhaps the most accessible venues for residents and aspiring artists to learn about arts, their collections should be as rich as possible.
	Another rationale behind my view is that art galleries would offer more benefits when they display artworks created in other regions. This is because exhibitions of galleries could thus let children comprehend brilliant aspects of different nations and their cultures. Art galleries are one of the most common destinations of school trips and the impressions that students get from these galleries may broaden their horizons. Thus, displaying diversified arts is imperative to develop children’s knowledge and understanding of other cultures.
	To conclude, a variety of artworks and artefacts in museums and art galleries would have more positive influences on cultural advancements and developing global perspectives of children and people alike. It is expected that museums and art centres would focus on these important issues when deciding the type of collection they are going to have.

Essay 84:
	Undoubtedly, cricket is the most popular sport in subcontinental countries because there is hardly any part of this region where cricket is not played and relished. Though they have their national sports, cricket has gained far more popularity. Hereby, I will throw some light on some of the possible reasons behind this phenomenon.
	The predominant reason for cricket being so popular among subcontinental nations is that this sport was introduced to them by the British during the colonial period. Most countries in this area became familiar with the rules and regulations of this game and started playing it and then ultimately became proficient in it. Moreover, these developing nations have imitated English culture for a long, whether it is style, language or sport, and the importance of the English language in these countries is convincing enough evidence of the fact that whatever was introduced by the English in their occupied countries continued to be flourished.
	Moving further, national sports like hockey, Kabaddi, Volleyball and so on have limited international tournaments, whereas cricket has various events like ICC Cricket World Cup, IPL, Ashes Series, ICC World T20 and many more. Therefore, cricket gets a lot more media coverage than any other national game in these countries. As a result, everyone has a special affinity towards cricket and cricketers as well, especially youngsters who have a profound passion for this sport. Teams like India, Pakistan, Australia, South Africa and Sri Lanka have been world champions multiple times while others are emerging powers in cricket. So it is only natural that they have a huge number of fans who enjoy cricket as a sport.
	To recapitulate, cricket dominates the sports world, particularly in countries like India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Australia and South Africa, which have gone through the influence of English culture during the English colonial era and where this sport is considered a part of national pride due to their success and fanbase.

Essay 85:
	People have different views about learning history and using the knowledge of history to shape the future. Although some people argue that studying history has nothing to offer, others opine that examining history has a great prospect for discovering our past and using the knowledge to shape our future. This essay investigates both views, but I am personally inclined toward the latter viewpoint.
	According to some people, learning history is a waste of time and energy. They believe that learning technology and science can bring significantly more benefits to humankind and the knowledge could be utilised for future development. History, on the contrary, has no utilisation in our daily life, according to them. For instance, science students can experiment and build helpful tools and devices, and this can lead to magnificent future inventions while pupils from history majors are imposed to memorize dates and events from the past.
	But this is not the whole picture according to many others. Learning history not only tells us about past events but also prepares us for the future. We can not expect to avoid a large-scale catastrophe if we do not know why it happened in the first place. In the 19th century, for example, Ireland suffered the blight of potatoes, known as the Irish Potato Famine, and it happened because the Irish were largely dependent on potatoes. Had they planted another crop, this could have been avoided. However, this unpleasant history has taught us a great lesson - to cultivate a wide diversity of crops. Finally, teaching history in school helps foster patriotism among the youth which is quite important for a bright future generation.
	In conclusion, people learn important lessons from experience and to build a prosperous nation, we must learn from our history which offers the greatest experience of all. Without knowledge of history, scientific discoveries alone cannot bring a wide range of advantages.
Essay 86:
	History, according to many, is the gateway to the past and a reflection of the future. Others, however, see very little value in learning history and emphasize the study and practice of more important subjects and fields like science, arts, technology, engineering and so on. I possess the opinion that studying history is not useful, and we should better utilise our time by learning technology and science, and important life skills.
	On the one hand, history offers us the opportunity to learn about our past society, civilisation, important national and global events, outcomes of major decisions, wars, social changes and so on. It helps us plan for a better future as the lessons learned from history can help us avoid catastrophes or plan for a brighter future. For instance, we can learn what triggered a major war or how a natural disaster caused havoc to people from history. Such knowledge and insights are important to prevent future conflicts and disasters. Moreover, many historical facts and findings inspire us to invent or discover new devices or theories to accelerate scientific and social progress.
	On the other hand, most students study and memorise important dates, names of people, events, causes and results of something etc. when they study history. People, outside of the academic arena, also study history mostly for the sake of learning about past events. Such studies have little significance in the practical world. Knowing how ancient people used to survive has almost zero value in survival in the modern world. So goes for the inventions as well- learning about past inventions has very little to do with inventing something novel. Moreover, human history is full of human conflicts and wars, and learning about them may discourage people from respecting our very civilisation. This is why, I wholeheartedly believe that people should invest more time learning and researching science, technology, engineering, and arts to bring about positive changes in their lives as well as in the society they live in. 
	To conclude, history can give us some details of the past which has very little value, in my opinion, to shape the future. It is more practical to learn and hone our knowledge and skills in science, arts and technology for a better future.

Essay 87:
	Universities, supreme citadels for building an enlightened generation, play a pivotal role in shaping a country's destiny. Thus the curriculum they follow to teach pupils has a profound impact on its overall outcome. Though some scholars believe that teaching a wide range of subjects at the tertiary level is far more beneficial than restraining the syllabus to a few particular subjects, I have reasons to disagree with this view.
	First of all, universities cannot teach all the subjects to the disciples and the notion of teaching them a great number of subjects is impractical. For instance, an average university has more than 40 departments or so and they are meant to specialise students in a particular field, not try to make them experts in all trades only to hopelessly produce mediocre professionals. Many public universities are already struggling to finish the course in time and if more subjects are added, that would simply make the scenario worse.
	Furthermore, a medical student, when forced to study history and poetry, would feel less connected to those subjects, ultimately ending with less specialised knowledge and skill. Similarly, a student from literature would find solving higher calculus a real challenge. The university already has its departments that pick students based on their merits and interests and the course offering should stick to that.
	Finally, someone does not need to excel in all subjects to do better in his profession. If an engineering student is interested in studying history, he can always do so even if the university curriculum does not include it. Many eminent scientists had little knowledge of other subjects and that did not deter them from changing the world forever, and this can be a great example of how specific subjects at the tertiary level can be more beneficial than the idea of adding a list of unrelated subjects.
	To conclude, the areas of studies, especially in this modern era, are myriad and thus adding a spectrum of subjects in every major is not a practical idea.
Essay 88:
	Some people advocate teaching university learners a wide range of subjects while others are in favour of making them specialised in a particular field with few subjects. I believe that teaching many different subjects make tertiary students better prepared for their career, life and society. This essay will outline my perspective.
	It is true that when university pupils have fewer subjects to focus on, they can learn those subjects better as they get more time to master the concepts of those subjects. This is why many universities around the world have introduced many majors like creative arts, robotics, fashion design, and genetics, to name a few, that have fewer credit hours and hence, fewer subjects to study. And it has produced some talented professionals who have excelled in these fields over the years.
	However, university education, I believe, is not meant to produce just skilled professionals who would work better in their respective job fields and make huge money. Rather, it should aim to create enlightened and knowledgeable individuals who would lead the nations in the future. This is why a doctor should learn the history of the nation so that he never forgets that his primary aim is to serve the nation and not make money. Similarly, if a software engineer has no knowledge of accounting, the financial sector would struggle to have useful software for their automation. I wholeheartedly believe that a university builds a strong foundation for a person to become a responsible and qualified individual and the more subjects they study the stronger their foundation becomes. 
	In conclusion, studying fewer subjects in a university seems like have some benefits on the surface but it does not serve the true purpose of university education - to create leaders and an enlightened generation. So it is expected that universities would introduce a spectrum of subjects to most majors to reap the maximum benefit.
Essay 89:
	It is often suggested that disciples of tertiary institutions should have a wide range of subjects in their curriculum rather than a few particular subjects. I, however, disagree with this viewpoint primarily for two major reasons.
	First, universities aim to provide specialized knowledge to their pupils, not enhance their general knowledge. Students are offered admission to universities after they complete many years of academic studies on various subjects. They are in a tertiary institution primarily to gain specific knowledge related to their field of interest. Giving redundant pressure by imposing subjects unrelated to their field can become a hurdle in achieving the required goal sets in their life. For instance, there is little relationship between sociology and mathematics. Mathematics majors will get confused while learning various aspects of sociology and similarly, sociology students will be reluctant to solve complex mathematics.
	In addition to this, many universities are already trying hard to maintain their recognized status and some are providing only specializations in a few subjects. The addition of more subjects to each faculty will add unnecessary weight, and as a result, there will be discordant opinions and actions among them. For example, 'Indian Institute of Technology Delhi' is among the top universities in India and provides specialization in scientific research and technology. If they are forced to add Arts related subjects to their science majors, they will soon find themselves struggling for their excellence.
	In conclusion, universities are meant for specialization and students should study subjects related to their major or which they feel interested in. The urge to add a spectrum of irrelevant subjects will detriment the true purpose of university education.

Essay 90:
	Distance learning, a modern phenomenon, has become widely popular, especially after the invention of the internet. In the pre-internet era, it was confined to posts and TV and could attract a nominal number of learners. Despite a boom in home-based learning trends due to technological advancements, it is not as beneficial as attending a formal educational institute, as far as I am concerned.
	To begin with, university education is not restricted to some textbook lessons as it also focuses on creating an enlightened generation through a favourable environment where students learn to interact with each other, discover the diversity of cultures, and learn to face real-life challenges. Some video scripts and printed documents cannot teach them how to use those in the practical world. For instance, someone who learns a skill online finds it difficult to implement it in the real world. Thus their poor performance in professional life is imminent.
	Moreover, instructors have extensive experience in dealing with students from different backgrounds and modify their lessons according to the capacity of the students. This is completely missing in the distance learning method and thus the single-package-fits-all model is less productive. Taking an online course to learn to play the guitar could be a classic example. A recent study by the University of Sussex reveals that nine out of ten online guitar learners fail to master it due to the lack of motivation and this is where formal education comes in - motivating students. Taking distance learning courses for learning a programming language, or how to cook a cuisine can be useful for many but this can never be an alternative to the education we receive from colleges and universities.
	To conclude, we attend educational institutes to learn and become enlightened citizens, not to memorise lessons and pass exams. While distance learning can be a bonus to our already enlightened minds, it can never be the same as studying at a college or university.
Essay 91:
	Distance learning programmes and online courses have gained huge momentum after the invention of the internet and it has become a major tool for education during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite some people's claim that it can never be as beneficial as the classroom-based education system, I beg to differ with the notion.
	The classroom-based teaching system has some distinct advantages which some people fail to achieve when they enrol in a course offered on a TV, or even on the internet. In such distance-learning courses, teachers do not directly interact with the learners and cannot assess the individual progress of participants. Assessment of learners' exam papers is also not always accurate as there is a possibility of cheating in the exam. This is why some people never consider online or distance learning as fruitful as the traditional face-to-face learning method.
	However, the global coronavirus pandemic, and restrictions due to this, forced us to adopt an online-based learning system to such an extent that people never imagined would happen. It has not only made learners get used to online learning but has also made teachers more adept at conducting online classes and exams. People now realise that online learning is a highly advantageous and less expensive way of learning and gaining skills. New tools like better LMS (Learning Management System), communication tools, exam tools, and assessment tools have revolutionised the whole concept of distance learning. It has also opened our eyes that technology has much to offer than just conducting online classes. For instance, during the corona pandemic, my younger sister's college adopted an online education and exam portal which they still use as the main method of assignment submission and conducting exams.
	Finally, online learning platforms enable people from any age group and any region to enrol in courses and develop their skills at a very affordable price. For instance, a housewife from India can take a graphic design course offered by a teacher or a group of skilled graphic designers from the USA. This proves how online learning is going to replace many traditional learning methods due to its immense possibility and global accessibility.
	In conclusion, the aspects that we have always believed online and distance learning methods can not offer have been achieved by technology and adopted by teachers and learners alike. Online learning is now mainstream and going to be as beneficial, and in some cases even more beneficial, as the traditional education system.

Essay 92:
	Modern medical facilities and research in the healthcare sector have brought miracles to the world. We have cures for deadly diseases, and researchers are working with our genes to prevent diseases even before we are born - marvellous indeed! As a result, people these days live longer. This is an alarming trend according to some while I firmly believe that longer life expectancy offers far more advantages than demerits.
	Many people opine that higher life expectancy increases the ratio of the older population and shrinks the active workforce. Thus they believe supporting the old generation is a burden for the country. But, this opinion is misguided and not backed by facts. With an increasing life expectancy, people these days remain more active and contribute to society even in their old age. As the government has raised the retirement age, old people are no longer a burden, rather an active workforce. To cite an example, professors, researchers, lawmakers, writers and many other professionals have vast experience and could contribute even more in their old age. Thus, when a physicist discovers a groundbreaking theory in his or her 70s, we should thank the enhanced medical research and treatment.
	Finally, as the number of working parents is heightening, grandparents are the last hope for young children. Older people are doing us a favour by taking most of our family burdens. Besides, people who we consider no longer useful to society due to their age, have gifted us the world we live in today with their hard work, tax money and love.
	To conclude, thanks to the enhanced medical facilities for which we now live longer and be part of the progress. This enhanced life expectancy is a blessing for the human race.
Essay 93:
	Technological advancements have not only attributed to many new scientific discoveries but remarkably improved medicine and medical science also. This century is sanctified with comprehensive medical care, and the lifespan of people has enhanced and still increasing through modern medicines and treatments. I believe the result has blessed human civilisation and the disadvantages of increasing life expectancy are ignorable.
	Ultra-modern facilities and advanced medicines have transformed medical facilities and cured many deadly diseases. With an improved lifespan, people can contribute more to society. Early retirement plans let them start another profession as they are more active these days. For instance, many professionals these days start their own businesses after their retirement. This trend welcomes freshers to have jobs and eradicates unemployment to a great extent while also contributing to the national economy.
	Moreover, as a direct result of improved life expectancy, people can spend more time with their family and grandchildren. Working parents can leave their children in safe hands while at work. The way grandparents care for their grandchildren is incomparable to the attention they would receive from a daycare centre. So, we need our elder parents to be with us more than ever before. Finally, the way many see the elder generation as a responsibility to society is no longer true. These elder people can share their experiences that we can use to build a better and safer world. Older politicians, bankers, writers and researchers, for example, have far more to offer than their young counterparts.
	In conclusion, an improved lifespan profoundly benefits the family as well as society. We should feel obliged to treat our ancestors as they did for us when we were children. They are no longer a burden, but an asset to the country.
Essay 94:
	The global population will be eight billion soon, a staggeringly high number than the ideal population that the world can support, and advanced medical care has, on top of that, increased people's life expectancy, making the situation graver than ever before. Higher life expectancy, as a result of modern medical care, though thought to be a blessing, actually has more negative consequences on our economy and society. 
	The first advantage of increased life expectancy is that it allows people to live longer and let them share their experiences with the younger members. These senior members can also look after the children and contribute to developing their ethical and moral characteristics. Moreover, they can sometimes remain active and contribute to the national economy. For instance, many elders start a shop or a business after their retirement and it has a positive contribution to creating jobs.
	However, the disadvantages of a higher proportion of the aged population are profound and widespread. As the proportion of senior citizens increases in a country, the economy has to take more strain to support their living and healthcare. Moreover, higher life expectancy keeps more aged people in jobs and thus reduces career opportunities for younger people. The social consequences of this trend are also very high. Since young people are busy with their jobs, they have little time to care for their aged parents and grandparents. As a result, those people do not get enough time from their family members that they need. The youngsters also suffer from guilt as a result. This is leading us to a more selfish societal situation that we should avoid by all means.
	To conclude, advanced medical care has blessed us with higher life expectancy but has also created profound economic and social problems. I believe the disadvantages of higher life expectancy far outweigh its benefits when we judge things from practical, economic and societal points of view.

Essay 95:
	Gone are the days when shopping malls were purely for selling different merchandise, and people went there for buying and selling products. However, with the advent of modern shopping complexes, the trend has shifted, and many people spend their free time in shopping malls for various reasons. It has several positive impacts despite a few negative outcomes - I believe. This essay argues how this trend has enhanced people's shopping experience and enabled people to socialise. 
	To begin with the negative aspects of spending leisure time in a shopping complex - it makes people lethargic and forces them to avoid outdoor activities. For instance, people who meet others in a park, swimming pool or playground get involved in group activities which is a good way of doing different physical exercises. On the contrary, when people meet friends in a shopping mall, they either eat fast food or watch a movie - both of which lack physical movements. On top of that, those people usually avoid outdoor activities as they prefer air-conditioned indoors more.
	However, modern shopping malls have enhanced our shopping experience to a great extent. All the goods are available under a single roof, and they have a cosy environment and superior security. We can buy whatever we need at a completive price, eat our favourite dishes, try exotic menus, watch movies, play games, and even hit the gym located in such shopping complexes. Not to mention, meeting friends and relatives would be quite a cumbersome process had there been no modern shopping malls. Thus this trend is enormously beneficial to all of us. 
	Moreover, most modern cities, especially those in populous countries, hardly have parks, swimming complexes, or playgrounds. This is why people can meet others at a shopping complex, and it helps them remain social rather than spending too much time online. For instance, whenever a few of my friends from university plan for a get-together, a nice shopping complex in our city comes to our mind because it makes the gathering and experience enjoyable. 
	To conclude, the old notion of a shopping centre - just for buying and selling products - is no longer applicable in modern days since our expectations, lifestyles, and the availability of outdoor amenities have changed a great deal. So, spending free time or meeting others in a shopping mall should be treated as a welcoming trend due to its usefulness.  
	The establishment of modern shopping plazas in every nook and corner of the country, especially in cities, has inspired many to enjoy their spare time with friends and family, do some shopping, enjoy movies, and have meals together. Shopping for basic needs is an old trend, but it is changing rapidly and shopping malls, these days, are primarily recreational places for many. I believe this trend has an adverse effect on the young generation and frequent shoppers.
	Modern shopping centres play a quintessential part by offering various products under a single roof ranging from the smallest to largest and the latest equipment and gadgets, costumes, ornaments, all types of fruits, vegetables, beauty products, kitchen appliances and so on. Besides, these shopping complexes have movie theatres, coffee shops, kid's corners and food courts to attract more people to spend their free time. However, people, who frequently go there, knowingly or unknowingly are becoming shopaholics, consuming junk foods and spending unproductive time. This has a detrimental effect on people, particularly on young minds. They often skip their classes to meet friends at a shopping mall, have aerated drinks, eat junk foods and avoid participating in different outdoor sports.
	Furthermore, people's urge to purchase things they do not need creates a monetary asymmetry and put them in debt. When parents should take their children to a park or to a museum, they are actually taking them to a shopping mall and feeding them fast food. This will invite a disaster in terms of our future generation's health and education.
	To conclude, I believe that killing a great deal of time in shopping centres will become a stagnated issue in the future. I strongly feel that shopping malls should be used as a place for purchasing essential commodities rather than a place for leisure activities.
	To what extent do you think this is a negative trend?
Essay 96:
	Shopping malls, these days, are considered major recreational spots by many while most people used to visit them for necessity in the past. This new trend has many negative impacts on people and society as a whole. This essay will argue why it is completely unnecessary for people to spend their free time in the marketplace and how this is a negative trend.
	To begin with, modern shopping complexes offer many amenities and shoppers tend to enjoy roaming around different markets both for purchasing what they like and socialising. For instance, many pupils prefer to meet up in a shopping mall, watch a movie and later have snacks in the food court. They say this reduces the stress of the exams and makes them relaxed. Besides, with the decline of open places and parks, many families gather at large shopping malls to enjoy their holidays. However, this is a negative trend and has health hazards.
	As a consequence, the young generation tends to forget the beauty of nature and the stress relief provided by the outdoor world. This, in fact, drains out the energy of the youth and makes them lethargic. For example, a walk in a park or a day on a beach refreshes the soul more evidently than a day in a mall. Besides, due to the excessive affection towards shopping, many people become shopaholics and get into debt.
	To conclude, citizens should not spend their free time in shopping malls as there are better alternatives. It is hoped that people will go to a shopping mall to do essential shopping but spend their free time outdoors to enjoy the beauty of nature and take part in open-air activities.

Essay 97:
	As an international language, English already dominates the world. From this regard, people around the world learn this language and whether learning it from a native mentor is the best approach is controversial. Though direct guidance from a native English teacher can be of great help, I do not consider it the best approach as there are other better methods to learn this language.
	However, mentorship from native tutors is one of the ways to be fluent in English, not the best way. Self-study, exposure to English-speaking people and their cultures, online language courses, devotion and extensive reading habits can be more effective in becoming a good user of English. For instance, millions of self-made writers, journalists and interpreters have had no access to native teachers. Furthermore, passion to learn a language can often make someone versed in the language as these people invest a great deal of time to learn it from books and online resources. To cite an example, I studied in a school where roughly one in five students was from English-speaking countries but most of the composition contest prizes went to non-natives.
	To conclude, having teachers who are from an English-speaking country is undeniably a great way to have better exposure to the language but this is not the best way to become versed in English. Self-study, passion and digital resources can be more helpful in most cases.
Essay 98:
	The saying "if you want to learn the language, learn the culture first" is indeed true when learning English. From native teachers, we can learn the language in the best possible way because they can ingrain the culture of the language among the learners while also showing us the context of a word, or expression and helping us with the correct pronunciation.
	To begin with, native educators use the language in their everyday life, and they know the contextual meaning of a word or expression. This is why learners comprehend words and expressions with their contextual meaning - which is perhaps the best way to learn English because, in it, the same word can mean several different things based on the context. For instance, only a native teacher can explain what the word "terrific" means when used by a British. Furthermore, teachers, whose first language is English, can teach students the culture and history associated with words and sentences, and it is a proven way to enhance vocabulary and master language skills. To cite an example, a teacher from London, who taught us literature at our university, explained a couple of Shakespear's writing which, despite reading before, most of us had no idea about. 
	Moreover, a native teacher can teach better pronunciation than a non-native teacher. During my university days, I was surprised to find out how erroneous many of my English word pronunciations were. Thanks to a couple of native teachers who helped me with that. Finally, native mentors, unlike non-native teachers, focus more on the practical aspects of the language rather than forcing learners to memorise hundreds of grammatical rules. It makes learning more interesting and functional.
	In conclusion, the English language could be learned in many different ways, but when someone has the opportunity to learn it from native instructors, this is definitely the best possible way to master the language and use it in everyday life.

Essay 99:
	More than one-tenth of the global population suffers from some sort of psychological issue and yet mental illness gets far less priority than it deserves. Minor psychological issues are often ignored by the family while severe cases are inappropriately treated only to tag them as madmen.
	There is no denying that mental illness, compared to physical diseases, does not get proper care and acceptance from society all around the world.
	To begin with, the number of general hospitals and the specialist doctors and nurses devoted to treating diseases of our body is overwhelmingly higher than the healthcare centre and staff allocated for mental complexities. Someone just needs to walk a few blocks to notice a hospital in any city. However, this is not the case for clinics that deal with patients’ mental issues. This is huge discrimination when World Health Organization clearly outlines the number of patients who need psychotherapists, mental support and treatment for their psychological intricacies.
	Moreover, societal views towards a physically sick child are different than an autistic child. When the parents openly discuss the sickness of the former one, the latter tries to hide their children. This raises a serious question of moral integrity and social norm towards people who need special care. Due to the astigmatism of our social and healthcare system, we have so many cases of mental issues which go untreated. When each county increases its budget to research deadly diseases, there is scarcely any budget allocation for preventing suicides. For instance, the USA allocate a lion's share of its budget for the healthcare sector, but there is no separate allocation for preventing self-destruction, as this is not considered an illness at all.
	To conclude, the time has come for us to change the old dogma about psychological problems and understand that proper treatment for psychosocial patients is as much important as treating physically ill people.
Essay 100:
	Mental illnesses can significantly impact an individual's ability to function in their daily life, yet they are often invisible and harder to understand than physical illnesses. This can lead to society being less accepting of people with psychological illnesses compared to those with physical issues, and this essay completely agrees with this view. 
	While it is true that psychological conditions can be just as debilitating as physical illnesses, it is also important to acknowledge that physical illnesses are often more obvious, life-threatening and easier to diagnose. Furthermore, physical illnesses often have a clear cause and treatment plan, whereas psychological illnesses can be more complex and difficult to diagnose.
	However, it is important to note that the invisibility of psychological illnesses does not make them any less real or severe. People with mental illnesses often struggle with daily tasks and may experience a great deal of pain and suffering. This invisibility can also make it difficult for individuals to receive the support and resources they need to manage their illnesses. Society's lack of understanding and acceptance can also lead to stigmatization and discrimination, further exacerbating the struggles of those with psychological illnesses. For instance, according to a recent article published in the Women's Health magazine, nine out of ten women - who suffer from mental illnesses, think of ending their life at some point. This is quite disturbing considering the high percentages of such cases.
	Moreover, the number of hospitals, diagnostic centres, doctors and healthcare service providers that we have to treat our physical ailments is far greater than the number of psychologists or mental therapists we have. The discrimination is even more severe in poor and developing countries where people do not have adequate means to seek medical help when they are ill, let alone talk to a psychoanalyst about their mental issues. This discrimination clearly outlines the societal biases towards our physical illness than our physiological sufferings.
	In conclusion, it is crucial to raise awareness and educate people about psychological illnesses while also offering mental help when needed. This can help to reduce the stigma and increase acceptance and understanding of mental problems as they are not less severe than physical sickness.

Essay 101:
	In this era of "freedom of speech and democracy", restricting information for the sake of vague public security and national importance seems quite irrational to many when others opine that information should be available only when the authority deems them suitable for access. Both parties have their reasons for arguments, and I personally believe that scientific studies, the academic arena, and businesses can be greatly benefitted if the information is made open to them without restrictions.
	To begin with, sensitive information, that could penetrate state security, lead to public outcry, hand over technologies to terrorists and facilitates corporate monopoly in the trade sector, deserves to be scrutinized before making them public. In this digital era, information spread like wildfire and for the sake of maintaining global peace, it should be delimited, according to many. For instance, if nuclear technology is shared with all nations for scientific studies, the world will soon stand on the verge of obliteration, despite the inconceivable possibility this technology possesses to facilitate the citizens' energy demands.
	On the contrary, scientific research largely depends on available data and previous findings. If valuable information and past findings are not shared openly with academics and researchers, global progress will become a standstill. For instance, the Internet is probably the most significant invention the modern world has produced and if this technology had not been shared by the US military, we would still be living in the pre-internet era. Moreover, clandestine information has no value if it is not implemented in the real world and thus curbing them is like slaughtering the potential for progress. Finally, world history suggests that the human race has advanced due to discoveries and inventions shared with the world as each finding went through profound modification and advancement. I thus personally favour the ideology that supports "free information for all".
	In conclusion, information has limited value when it is constrained and not shared with great minds. For true global progress, restrictions on valuable information should be debarred and let people know the truth instead of keeping them in dark.
Essay 102:
	Some people favour sharing information for research works, business development and academic needs without any filters or restrictions. Others, however, feel differently and opine that sensitive and valuable information should not be shared in any case. Both parties have their reasons, and this essay opines that not all information should be shared even for scientific, research and business purposes. 
	It is understandable that when information is made available to organisations, scientists, researchers, and academics, they are best utilised. Since, those people work to bring innovations, restricting them to access important information can hinder progress. For instance, if expert economists are denied access to the state's financial data, they would neither be able to guide the nation for a better financial future nor can alert the nation in case of an imminent financial crisis.    
	On the other hand, some information should never be shared because it is undeniable that unfiltered access to all information can sometimes be catastrophic. For instance, if a state allows businesses to have unrestricted access to all the data related to citizens, the organisations would start violating citizens' privacy. They would start using the data for their business gains while also selling the data to other companies. Moreover, nations have intelligence and defence agencies, and if their findings are shared with academics and researchers, they would end up falling into wrong hands and thus compromising the state's sovereignty and power of defence. This is why, I personally believe that a state should share information that can bring innovation and help the nation progress, and at the same time, make some data restricted so that rough people do not have access to such critical and sensitive data.  
	In conclusion, information is immensely important when they are properly utilised and could also be destructive if they are misused by the wrong people. This is why the information should be shared for the betterment of the nation but some sensitive data should never be shared.
Essay 103:
	Some people advocate for making all information available in science, business, engineering and research as they believe that sharing information in such fields to the fullest extent possible will ultimately benefit society as a whole. Others, however, think that some information and state secrets are too sensitive to be shared freely. This essay explores both perspectives. In my opinion, important sectors in a country should have unrestricted access to important and useful data.
	It is important to consider the benefits of making information available for sectors that bring innovation and development to a nation. It is undeniable that by sharing new findings and useful data, society can progress and prosper faster. For example, after the discovery of the first antibacterial drug was made public, it allowed the entire world to benefit from its use as an effective medication against infectious diseases. Additionally, sharing valuable and meaningful information can lead to collaboration and progress in research, as well as the development of new technologies and products for a nation. It is also apparent that a society, where people have limited access to information, is less likely to become pioneers in technology, invention and research.
	However, there are also some valid arguments against sharing all information considering the sensitivity of the information in question. Intellectual property rights are an important consideration here, as inventors and researchers invest both their knowledge and significant amounts of money to achieve their goals. Publishing their findings prematurely can prevent them from fully reaping the rewards of their hard work. A good example is "Apple Inc." which invented different ingenious technological devices, and if the research data were published, it would not be able to earn profits as there would be competitors who would use the findings and compete in the market.
	In conclusion, it is important to appreciate the rights of individuals and businesses to protect their intellectual property, the progress and prosperity of a nation should get more priority, and ultimately, the sharing of information can lead to greater advancements and benefits for all.

Essay 104:
	Today's world is staggering under conflicts, terrorism and cross-border wars that make global peace a distant reality. Even in this gloomy moment, many people think that international sporting events can play an essential role in restoring to global peace and harmony. I agree with this viewpoint primarily because I believe that global sporting events have the power to bring people and nations closer, and promote the message of peace.
	It is sometimes observed that major sporting events create tensions and bring unfavourable outcomes like controversy, heated debate and misunderstanding. In such events, it may seem that such international sporting events make nations hate each other rather than bring them closer. However, such controversies are short-lived, and they are sparked among die-hard fans and online discussions while most viewers tend to enjoy the game and remain out of conflict.
	There is no denying that sports on such an international scale bring people together. Regardless of race, religion, nationality and gender, sports fans share the same passion and enthusiasm. And when they gather in a venue, they tend to learn from each other and see the human side of people. It brings them closer and gives them an extraordinary opportunity to share their sportsmanship quality and compassion for all people in the world. For instance, the Olympic Games event gives a perfect opportunity for athletes from all around the world to gather and display their athletic prowess to a global audience where people appreciate their performance and talents and forget their dissimilarities.
	Moreover, such global events promote the message of peace as the spirit of games overcome the barriers and conflicts nations have. This is why millions of people become one when their national team performs to bring glory to the nation. They forget the differences in their ethnicity, background and class, and it helps positively promote nationality; thus paving the way for peace and unity. For instance, when players of two rival nations like India and Pakistan, or Iran and the USA, show amicable behaviours on and off the field, millions of audiences learn to appreciate their relationship with the people of the rival nation. This is immensely helpful in paving the way to maintaining global peace.
	To conclude, major global sporting events not only bring people from different parts of the world together but also ease tensions and promote the message of peace. 
Essay 105:
	Major sporting events are meant for athletes and sportspersons to perform and bring glory to their nations while also positively promoting global harmony. However, it is a cruet reality that such international events fail to promote global peace and accord, and are often subject to controversy and conflicts. This is why, I disagree with the opinion that such international sporting competitions contribute positively towards global stability, peace and unity.
	To begin with, when players display excellent sportsmanship in a major sporting event, the global audience tent to enjoy the performance. Friendly relationships among players from rival nations also set examples for spectators. But, it has little impact on the politics of two rival nations and has very little to do with lasting peace among nations. For instance, millions of people enjoy when players of India and Pakistan perform in cricket stadiums. It often brings citizens of these two countries together, but it has failed to make any positive impact on the political relationships between these two nations.
	Moreover, major sporting events are the stages for competitions, and there is always a winning and a losing team. The same decision made by a match referee is welcomed by the fans of a nation while vehemently opposed by the supporter of another team. It is not a conducive approach to supporting peace, unity and brotherhood among people from different nations. Rather, it sparks argument and controversy. For instance, after most World Cup competitions, people have diving opinions about the decisions made by referees, and they never tend to agree with the opposing supporters. It has even sparked fights and conflicts in and out of the stadium.
	To conclude, international sporting events are great events to bring people of different nations to a common platform, but due to their competitive natures and controversies, they fail to help promote peace and harmony among nations.
Essay 106:
	Sports, in the past, used to be considered a juvenile activity confined to parks and indoors only. But sports, these days, have pushed the boundaries and attracted national and international players and audience by bringing people closer. So, there is no denying that sports have the power to unite the world and maintain global peace, and I completely agree with this viewpoint.
	Undoubtedly, sports at the international level play a sterling role in diplomatic relations among different nations. Owing to historical or political reasons, not all countries are at peace with each other. Admittedly, sports evoke similar pleasure and satisfaction as a victory in a war does, but it brings nations together. Moreover, global sports events can be icebreaker as competitors from nations create a common platform for global leaders, organizations, and athletes to interact in a more convenient and sophisticated way. A good illustration is the Olympic games in which the whole world can be brought together and this has a positive impact on maintaining global harmony.
	Furthermore, sports evokes high nationalistic passions towards the country along with providing a platform for patriotic emotions to be released. It is a constructive way to exhibit one's patriotic emotions. Even, international sporting events such as Commonwealth games bring recognition to small countries. For instance, it is difficult to know about the West Indies and Nepal, however, they are well-known countries just because of their cricket teams. By and large, the sport is the only activity that delivers a clear message of peace and paves the road to building world harmony.
	To reiterate, sports is a positive activity that kills negativity and brings peace and joy to the world by bringing people and global leaders together.

Essay 107:
	Crimes, in many countries, have gone beyond the tolerable rate, and it is a common practice to incarcerate convicted people. A segment of society opines that not all crimes are equal and the repercussion of harsh sentences for all offences is uncivilised. They outline the need for unpaid community service as punishment for mild offenders and youngsters, and I also believe that certain offenders should be given non-custodial sentences.
	The predominant reason for me to believe in voluntary community service like cleaning streets, planting trees, and working for charity instead of the prison sentence is that many offenders are not born criminals, and circumstances often push them to commit a transgression. Besides, when such unpremeditated convicts are expelled from society, they incline to re-offend in isolation as there is none to accept them. Apart from this, juvenile delinquents should be rehabilitated by indulging them in community services. A recent study reveals that many youngsters who had been in prison for a long time often end up becoming even bigger criminals.
	However, brutal offenders who commit heinous crimes like premeditated murder, vandalism, abduction, hijacking, rapes and so on should be punished to set examples in society. Thus, the background of a criminal and the motif of a crime should be considered. For instance, if a teenager steals food from a store as his mother is starving is a completely different crime than someone robbing an old lady and stabbing her violently. The former deserves a second chance while the latter should be imprisoned.
	To recapitulate, someone with no previous record of crime and a sensible reason for minor misconduct should be treated differently than a serious offender. The objective of the law is to maintain peace in society, not to punish people. Thus unpaid community service is a great option to let some convicted lament their crime and do something good for society.
Essay 108:
	Some people may commit a crime for self-defence or for a reason that can be justified when considered from that person's point of view. For example, many people speed drive because they have to reach a hospital quickly. In such cases, a prison sentence, especially for first-time offenders, seems a rather vicious penalty. The same can be said for someone who fails to pay a government fee due to financial problems. On the surface, they seem a crime, but not so severe when judged by the person's circumstances.
	However, our judicial system works in a systematic manner and considers the intent of committing a crime. Thus a drunk driver who crosses the speed limit and someone who does so to reach a hospital to treat an ill elderly are not treated equally. And light offenders are always given a chance to defend themselves. They are often just fined an amount of money rather than being behind bars. Since we already have a system to punish serious offenders and just reprimand light offenders, we do not need to award community work to certain criminals.
	Moreover, community work, as an outcome of a crime, fails to rehabilitate a convict mainly because such works are too light to make the offender regret his or her actions. The jails are made to reform someone when that person is considered a threat to society. And if they are not isolated, properly counselled, and given the time to repent, they will most probably commit even bigger crimes over time. For instance, according to a recent study, almost 30% of juveniles who are just given community or voluntary work for their minor offences often end up committing bigger crimes.
	To conclude, our law and judicial system consider the intent and circumstances of a crime and award punishments accordingly. So we do not need community work for crimes because this approach lacks the main objective of rehabilitating criminals.

Essay 109:
	Historical buildings are valuable treasures for a country and should be preserved even if the government needs to spend hefty amounts on them. I completely agree with this viewpoint and my position is outlined in this essay.
	First of all, old and traditional buildings are of great architectural importance. Their sublime design attracts tourists and locals alike and is quite rare in modern structures. These historical edifices also give us an opportunity to learn about the glorious past. For example, the Roman Colosseum in Rome not only shows how awe-inspiring the ancient architectures were but also points out a massive arena used as a stadium for gladiators' fighting and has space to house around 50,000 spectators in tiered seating. This structure is a predominant representative of Roman culture and civilisation that modern historians cherish profoundly.
	In addition to this, historical monuments also serve as tourist magnetism in many countries. In today's world, many people plan their vacations in places of historical importance as they are curious to know more about the culture and traditions of the past. Many nations are benefited from these tourists, and as a result, they possess a booming tourism industry. For instance, millions of tourists including international tourists visit the Taj Mahal in India every year. This provides the government with a huge profit and also employs many locals, thus assisting the government financially.
	To conclude, I believe, it is worth spending money on ancient buildings as they not only possess historical importance but also a financial kernel for many governments.

Essay 110:
	First impressions, without a doubt, have great importance, but they do not always reveal the true characteristics of a person and I believe that first impressions are not always accurate. This essay discusses why first impressions may often be deceptive and less important in judging someone.
	To begin with, first impressions often reflect a great deal of information about a person, especially if we meet this person all of a sudden. We can judge him from the way he dresses, speaks, starts a conversation and expresses his views. This is often the true reflection of a person's character. But this can often be ambiguous. For instance, my experience has taught me that people who become friends very quickly are less serious about a long-term friendship though they give an opposite impression on their first meet.
	Moreover, people try to behave modestly, act friendly, show compassion and exhibit their positive sides when they meet someone for the first time. Only a long-term observation can express their true nature and intention. From this regard, I would not agree with the view that my initial impressions about someone are always right. I believe we can learn many things about a person only when we spend time with the person, and can understand their true colour when we see and meet them closely.
	To conclude, people are one of the greatest mysteries in the world and judging someone at the first meet is kind of irrational. No doubt a great deal about someone could be learned from the first encounter, but this is not always right, at least not in my experience.
Essay 111:
	Two lines of thoughts exist when it comes to the significance of first impressions, and for many, they form the basis for judging a person’s personality and background. I believe that first impression is important to some extent; however, my support is in the favour of knowing the person better instead of establishing the judgments just on looks and dress-up as I support the more holistic way of getting to know people.
	To begin with, I believe that first impressions give just a glimpse of somebody’s character. There can be a variety of underlying factors and reasons for which the person might behave in a particular way. If someone, for example, does not initiate a conversation and does not smile at a party where it is required to mingle, it could be because the person is ill or have some sort of personal crisis going on. Judging by first impressions, that person can be easily labelled as arrogant and unfriendly. However, if someone makes an effort to know the person and the reason behind being a recluse in the party, the former judgment is entirely reversed. In addition, outer appearances change and evolve but the inner personality remains almost the same. People who form their perception on the basis of fleeting outer appearances are often mistaken.
	On the contrary, in some instances, for instance, a job interview, first impressions are of foremost importance. Recruiters are specifically trained to sort potential employees based on the first impression. The first impression not only includes the way of dressing, but also the way a person speaks and carries himself.
	To conclude, although there are instances where first impressions matter and needed to be taken into account, I strongly believe that it is always prudent to get to know a person better before jumping to a conclusion.

Essay 112:
	It is irrefutable that a country's growth largely depends on how educated and healthy its citizens are. The burgeoning population and the lack of funds often make it harder for the authority to bear the expenses of their needs, especially in education, housing and treatment. I believe that an effective solution would be to divide the expenditures between the government and the individuals.
	To begin with, education, nowadays, plays a vital role in the development of a society. Not only it creates job opportunities, but also help people become aware of the socio-economic issues of the country. Making education free till the age of 18 would encourage the pupils to finish at least their secondary education. For instance, the percentage of student enrollment in schools in 2011 in my country increased by 19% than that of 2009, and it was because the government exempted fees for students in these classes.
	Moreover, the healthcare system can also be improved by providing either health insurance or schemes that cover a minimum of 50 per cent of the cost. Thus people would not feel that healthcare is expensive while the government would not need to bear the expenses alone. A healthier nation can help the country achieve greater heights as citizens in such countries are more productive. Consequently, economic growths will get bolstered and the government would be able to become self-reliant.
	To conclude, with the implementation of the said measures there would be no burden on either the government or individuals. Both the government and individuals can go hand in hand to cope with this and build an enlightened and healthy nation.
Essay 113:
	Healthcare and education are two fundamental rights of every human being, and they are essential for the development of a country. Who should, however, bear the cost of healthcare and education - the public or the government, is controversial. But, I sincerely believe that the government should take responsibility to ensure free education and treatment to its citizens.
	To commence with, the government is not the authoritarian ruler of a country, not at least in this modern era. Rather a country has an administrative system so that the country runs properly, the authority can take development initiatives, laws and orders are maintained, citizens get their basic rights, and the country stands proudly among the world nations. If this is what the management wants to achieve it must alleviate people from poverty through education and training, and offer highly effective healthcare facility, without which the country and its tradition would crumble. Giving responsibility to its citizen to take care of their education and healthcare would be the last thing a government should do.
	Moreover, without ensuring education for all, no country can achieve growth and eliminate poverty, and keep pace with the world. Education not only helps people become financially independent but also enlighten them. On the other hand, proper healthcare makes a healthy nation that eventually contributes to building a better nation. The struggling education and healthcare systems in many poor countries, for example, are the main obstacle to their development.
	Finally, the government collects a staggering amount of revenue from direct and indirect tax each year. If this tax money is not spent on educating the taxpayers' children or ensuring their proper treatment, no other policy can better utilise this money. Besides, poor citizens rely on the government when it comes to changing their fate and keeping them well. Without ensuring education for their children and offering them healthcare services, the government fails to keep its promises.
	To conclude, healthcare and education are fundamental rights of citizens, and the government must ensure these two rights to them to fulfil its obligation to the nation and to help the country develop.

Essay 114:
	How much responsibility a child should take and whether modern children are less interested in executing their duties and obligations is disputable. While offsprings in some countries still take many responsibilities, a great number of them, in other countries, are busy with their education and hobbies. I believe that the way children take responsibilities has changed over time, mostly as a positive development, and to what extent a youth should carry out these liabilities should be determined by the family and social condition.
	To begin with, the social, economic and family structure in the past, in most of the countries, forced parents to distribute responsibilities among children and it was common for many young children to work hard and take care of younger family members besides their education. These young children learnt how to manage budgets, share with other family members and take challenges in life. Those important lessons, according to many, are no longer spread among the modern young generation and thus they become more selfish.
	However, with the change in the family structure and social norm, people these days want their children to excel in education and other creative fields rather than taking care of the family and finishing house chores. Joint family predominated society and parents had more children in the past. With the rise of the nuclear family and one-to-two-child-family policy, parents now focus on children's education, unlike in the past. In my opinion, blaming children for not taking responsibilities is an impartial judgement as modern children have far more pressure from schools, society and parents. They are not expected to earn money or do household works in a well-to-do family. With the increasing literacy rates, gender equality, women empowerment and a better lifestyle, the trend has more positive outcomes, without a doubt.
	To conclude, these days, we want our children to be the best scorer, best athlete, and outshine in everything they do unlike the past when parents wanted assistance from their offsprings to support the family. Thus the changes have brought numerous developments, and the move was inevitable with the paradigm shift of social structure.

Essay 115:
	Commemoration of important national events is a part of a nation's pride and a way to show respects to its tradition and history. Such events are instrumental in motivating the new generation to be patriots and bestow tribute to people whose contributions are unforgettable. Thus the amount spent on such celebrations is justified.
	To begin with, public ceremonies are important in terms of spreading nationality, giving mass people a reason to forget their differences and improving public relations. The amount spent on such events is often disputed by many, but this opinion, is in no way, practical and the importance of observing national events is unparalleled. These celebrations, for example, teach us who we really are, how much our ancestors had sacrificed to give us a better country and how we are all connected as a nation. In my early childhood, I did not show an acute interest in the history of our country until I noticed the way people observe Independent Day and how the whole nation remembers the sacrifices of the martyrs from our country. We need to celebrate our significant national days to pass the history to the next generations.
	Now getting back to using the fund on more important things - a government already has a plan in place for disaster recovery and using funds for important sectors. Each sector in a country already gets a share of the national budget and we need to focus more on prudently using the fund for true development, not switching fund from one important sector to another. Finally, festivals are people's fundamental rights and a government should always support such public festivals including religious and national galas to prove that the authority works for the public, not against them.
	To conclude, public celebrations and a government's role to organise it and using the national fund to support it has a great influence in fostering nationality, showing a government's support to the people and this is why the amount spent for such events is essential.

Essay 116:
	Online education is a comparatively new trend and thousands of educational institutes have already embraced this method to offer their courses. While some negative aspects of this development could not be ignored, the advantages of it far outweigh the demerits.
	To begin with, many universities in developed countries offer online degrees and short courses, and they have started doing so only after proper research. The research proved that Internet-based courses are advantageous both for the students and teachers. The intuitive and methodical lessons offered by an online course is planned by several university teachers and technology experts and hence they maintain a rigid quality. The widespread use of the Internet makes it handy for people to enrol in a course without considering time and distance. This trend has attracted thousands of professionals, housewives and elderly people to continue their education or take courses of their choices. For instance, as many as twenty-five thousand housewives in the USA complete their preferred online courses and diplomas in a year. Attending traditional classroom-based courses were impossible for this large number of housewives and busy professionals.
	Moreover, Internet-based courses are easier to follow and someone can retake the same lessons over and over again, unlike traditional classes. Thus many students have reported the Khan Academy, Linda, and Udemy, renowned Internet-based online course websites, to be their preferred learning tools. Many skill-developing online courses, for example, have assisted thousands of young people to pursue their career in technology and this has all been possible with Internet-based learning.
	The downside of this trend is the cost and lack of proper supervision by a teacher. Courses offered by prestigious universities are often far too expensive for a poor student to bear. Teachers' guidance and motivation often play a great role in a pupil's success and the online course cannot be a suitable substitute for the motivation teachers can offer.
	To conclude, technological advancements in education, especially online education, is a great leap towards a world without illiteracy and unemployment. Hence, this is such a positive development though it lacks a teacher's motivation and direct supervision.

Essay 117:
	Choosing a place to live in and whether to rent it or own it is a big decision to make. Many people prefer to own a house rather than living in a rented apartment while others choose to do exactly the opposite. I believe that owning a house has far more advantages than renting an apartment.
	To commence with, people often rent a house because purchasing a property requires a great deal of money and the skyrocketing price in big cities makes it impossible for many to own a house. These people naturally rent an apartment. There are certain advantages to living in a rented apartment. First of all, the person does not have to pay a huge sum of money at a time and does not need to pay housing taxes and bear the costs of maintenance. Moreover, such people can change the living place based on the location of their workplace and children’s school. The renovation of the apartment is the landlord’s responsibility and the tenants do not need to worry about it.
	On the contrary, owning a house gives a sense of personal achievement that tenants cannot enjoy. A house is a permanent asset and with time its price increases. The landlord can rent the house and this can be a steady source of earning for him. Furthermore, being the owner of a house means there is no one over the shoulder to watch what someone is doing and no sudden notice for evacuation. For instance, we had to vacate our apartment all of a sudden at least thrice until we purchased our own house a decade earlier. This is some sort of freedom that only house owners enjoy. Besides, the owner can construct and design the house the way he likes and enjoy open space, garden, and other facilities in the house.
	To conclude, renting a flat has some benefits but the overall freedom and monetary compensations house owners enjoy are far significant, and this is why every tenant dreams to own a house someday.

Essay 118:
	According to the traditional belief, men are the breadwinners while females are caregivers and responsible for taking care of the family. This belief, along with some old-fashioned views like boys are good at mathematics while females are not, is the primary reason for many parents to encourage their sons to study science while daughters art-related subjects. I wholeheartedly believe that this trend should change.
	To begin with, it is generally believed that boys are good at science-related subjects. This view is rooted so deep in our society that many females have already accepted it. This is more prevalent in developing countries where parents expect their sons to have a career while daughters become moderately educated and finally get married and have a family. Strangely, studying in science majors require more money in most countries, and this is why parents naturally select their boys to study science. Females, on the other hand, need to take many responsibilities of the family even during their student life and prefer to have subjects that do not require a great deal of study, as they consider it.
	Men and women have similar capacities and hidden potentials. Given the equal opportunity, many women would excel in science-related subjects. Great scientists like Marie Curie, Ada Lovelace, and Emilie du Chatelet have proved that women are no less capable than men when it comes to science. The heinous trend of gender discrimination, even in the education sector, should stop. The good news is that women in many engineering and technology subjects are already occupying half of the seats in many prestigious universities. Thus the day is not far away when the social custom or emotional aversion of parents would accept that their daughters are just as talented as their sons are in any area, including science.
	To conclude, women empowerment is quite an essential factor for the overall development of a nation, and that is why females should get a fair chance to participate in any subjects, including science majors, in schools and universities. This trend would bring more positive outcomes than restricting their fields of education and work.

Essay 119:
	Parenting is perhaps the greatest responsibility of our life and mistakes and wrong decisions as parents can ruin a family as well as the future of a child. Since many young people become parents and the number of nuclear families is on the rise, many experts emphasize the importance of parenting courses for both fathers and mothers. I personally agree with this notion as I believe that such sessions would be immensely helpful.
	To begin with, proper parenting requires a great deal of knowledge and dedication. Sometimes minor negligence and lack of knowledge can lead to catastrophic outcomes. For instance, if busy parents forget to vaccinate a newborn, that would jeopardize the offspring’s life. Similarly, many parents believe in silly superstitions that influence them to make bad choices. If those parents attend a course where experts share their opinions on different aspects of child fostering and proper parenting, they would be highly benefitted. For example, my cousin Paula, who became a mother a few months ago believed that her child had a problem with digestion and need medical attention. However, it was revealed that the way she fed her daughter was not correct. I believe that a suitable course that brings out different aspects of upbringing a child, both moral and practical aspects, would prove out to be important for newly become parents.
	Moreover, the increasing trends of single parents and nuclear family lack the expert opinion of the grandparents, unlike in the past. This is why the need for such parenting sessions has risen even more. Such sessions bring parents together, let them share their views, forms a social relationship and help people learn the real facts about their personal prejudices. This is a great way to educate the "to-be-parents", and "newly-become-parents" to learn more about the practical aspects of parenting. It also makes a better society, in a broader sense.
	To conclude, being informed and educated parents is an important aspect to become good parents. Since parenting courses help people in a diverse way, it is indeed a good idea for people to participate in such courses.
Essay 120:
	Raising a child is considered a beautiful experience by parents and newly become parents often find it difficult. Though some parents feel that training classes on parenting will help them nurture their child properly, I believe otherwise. This essay will argue why it is unnecessary to undergo parenting training sessions in order to nurture one’s child.
	In today’s fast-growing world, parents believe that coaching on parenting and professional advice will help them responsibly raise their child. The reason parents feel the need for such courses is mainly because of the busy lifestyle and the growth of nuclear families. They neither not talk to their parents and get advice, nor are they confident enough in their ability to look after their child. For instance, in India, certain institutions provide full-time classes on parenting and their demand is increasing. Distance from other senior members of the family is the main reason so many parents turn to such institutions.
	However, being a parent is a natural and wonderful experience that does not require any training. As soon as a couple enters the phase of parenting, the ability to raise their child is naturally born in them. It’s just the confidence that is required and rest is attained gradually. Parenting needs are not the same for all and thus a predefined course is insufficient for many couples.
	To conclude, the parenting ability is naturally inbuilt in every individual and one has to just figure that out in order to raise their child and this has to attain through expertise, not from theoretical courses.

Essay 121:
	Perhaps the greatest threat to the world is not the atomic bombs, the regional conflicts, terrorism, an outbreak of population or political instability but the climate change and environmental degradation. If we do not address this greatest danger properly, we will be responsible for our own extinction, and I do not believe that we should let it happen by doing nothing about it.
	To begin with, the rising temperature, Arctic ice melt, deforestation, uncontrolled industrialization, air pollution and depletion of the ozone layer are all connected and would lead to a single event- the destruction of the world. We have already harmed the environment to a great extent and the time has come for all nations to work together to reduce the environmental damage. The sudden flood in the USA, intense storm in Asia, unpredictable droughts in Africa are all resulting from climate change and this change is occurring rapidly than ever before. If we let this continue, the future would be even more perilous. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, consequences of climate changes include the increased intensity of storms including tropical cyclones, increased risks of drought and, wetter Asian monsoon, and, possibly, more intense mid-latitude storms. According to a recent report, global warming would cause sea levels to rise up to 4 feet by 2100 and many countries including some South Asian countries would suffer greatly from that.
	The last thing the human should do to turn a blind eye to this imminent problem and learn to live with it, of course, unless we want the termination of the human race, that would be a whole different issue. There is a lot to do and we should start implementing regional cooperation right now. Every individual should contribute by emitting fewer fumes and planting as many trees as possible while the use of fossil fuel should be globally prohibited. Industrial countries have more responsibilities as they contribute more to environmental degradation and an international panel should be formed by giving it a supreme power to make any legislation to kerb the environmental damages.
	To conclude, for our existence on Mother Earth, we should take immediate actions both at individual and international levels to check climate change. Otherwise, we will fail to save our planet and future generations.

Essay 122:
	School curriculums may vary from school to school, but their primary objective is the same everywhere which is to educate and enlighten students. However, some people claim that school should focus more on job-oriented subjects rather than teaching traditional ones like arts and history. I personally disagree with this view and believe that traditional subjects are just as important as skill-oriented subjects are.
	To begin with, ‘job-oriented subject’ is itself an inexplicit term. Some would say that subjects that enhance practical skills like computing or gardening are job-oriented subjects, but no one can assure that all students in a class would become computer engineers and specialists in planting and gardening. That is why forcing pupils to study subjects that they do not feel interested in would bring negative results.
	Furthermore, schools are meant to nurture young students’ creativity, foster their talent to let them explore their true potential. From this perspective, imposing job-related subjects is like killing the inner soul of the future generation. Finally, if schools can bring diversity among students and inform them about different perspectives of life, the students would themselves choose their career and transcend in future. So there is no need to create a robotic generation with a particular skill only.
	Arts and history are as much important as any science and technical subjects are. The study of history empowers us to be prepared for the future and learn from our past mistakes. Similarly, arts and other traditional subjects allow us to learn to appreciate life. We revere Van Gauge and Leonardo da Vinci as much as we admire Sir Isaac Newton and Einstein. The world needs great artists and historians no less than it needs scientists and technicians.
	To conclude, schools should equally focus on traditional subjects and skill-oriented subjects and nurture students’ hidden potential to prepare the future generation to become leaders, not corporate slaves.
Essay 123:
	The curriculum for schools has become a matter of great concern as it directly influences the quality of education. Some people opine that academies should focus on job-oriented subjects that prepare pupils for a good career whereas others think that learners should be cognizant of their ancient path, tradition and heritage through learning arts and history besides their career preparation. This essay argues why it is necessary to emphasise traditional subjects, which are just as important as employment-oriented skills.
	Many schools primarily concentrate on subjects that help students improve their skills and get ready for jobs. This is mainly due to the present competitive world where people face cut-throat competition in securing a job. So people assume that developing practical skills from a younger age will help students perform well in professional life. For instance, some schools in India have adopted certain subjects that focus mainly on attaining a medical degree and thereby become a better physician in the future.
	However, it is essential for students to learn history, arts and similar subjects along with skill-oriented materials. Knowledge of culture and history allows students to become leaders than becoming corporate robots. For instance, the contribution of an explorer, leader and social worker is no less than that of a doctor or an engineer.
	In conclusion, the primary objective of education is to prepare the young generation to build a better world through their diverse contributions, not just become money-making machines. This is why arts and history are just as important as skill-related subjects in the national education curriculum.

Essay 124:
	To begin with, online shopping enables consumers to get a service or a product from home. They no longer need to travel a long distance or wait in a long queue to pay their bills or withdraw cash. With the widespread use of hand-held smart devices and the Internet, shopping is just a few finger taps away. This saves valuable times and enables people to use plastic cards which is more secure. Moreover, online banking, ticket booking system, e-payment and online subscriptions facilitate mass people to avoid traffic congestion and help maintain a green environment. From a business owner’s perspective, online shopping permits them to run the business 24x7 and without the need for any extra staff, utility bills and so on. This permits them to offer products at a more competitive price.
	Furthermore, consumers enjoy great freedom to purchase global products from renowned websites like eBay and Amazon and compare the quality and price of a product before making a purchasing decision. Perhaps the most noticeable benefit of this trend is the unparalleled opportunity it has brought for ordinary people to open their own online shops and run small businesses online. This would never have happened without the growth of online business trends.
	Among the drawbacks of online shopping, identity theft and digital scams are more common. Careless use of a credit card or sensitive personal information can often invite intruders and hackers to harm someone. Finally, online shopping does not allow someone to physically inspect a product before buying it and this often leads to customer dissatisfaction. However, these demerits can easily be avoided by being cautious and relying on reputed brands.
	To conclude, the overwhelming benefits that online shopping offer far outweigh a few demerits it has. I personally am an online shopper and I believe that this has immensely improved our freedom of shopping and lifestyle.

Essay 125:
	Many young students drop out of schools, sometimes to earn to support their families and sometimes due to other reasons, and this has a severe consequence to their future and society. Sometimes those students are to be blamed, but oftentimes, the system is responsible for it. The state should revise the way it runs schools and arranges re-schooling facilities while the school authority should provide some paid jobs to needy students to mend this situation.
	To begin with, many young pupils leaves schools without completing their education mainly to earn a wage to support their families, and this is more common in developing countries. According to a recent report, more than 30% of students leave schools in South Asian countries due to financial hindrance. The government in such a country should focus on developing the conditions of parents who have school-going offspring. Education should be free, and some subsidies should be provided to poor students. Besides, the government's initiatives to create more jobs would also improve this situation. However, the greatest step the government can take is arranging re-schooling facilities for those disarrayed pupils with some incentives and job provisions.
	Moreover, the school authority should make education more fun in school to retain young students. For instance, some Japanese schools use interactive and fun methods to teach young minds, and this has increased students’ school attendance dramatically. Such initiatives should be welcomed and more widely used. Besides, the school authority can arrange some clerical jobs for needy students to help them continue their studies.
	To conclude, education is the most important pillar for the development of a nation and the state and school authority should help students stay in schools and finish their academic years. Without having an educated nation, crime and unemployment would skyrocket to push society to complete chaos.
Essay 126:
	Education can change the fate of a nation, and educated citizens are the most important resources that a country can have. When a country has a large number of school dropouts, it struggles to develop, and it affects society negatively. The state must take necessary initiatives to improve the situation by encouraging young students to finish their education and establish enough night schools for working-class young people who want to continue their education.
	To begin with, young students often find it hard to continue their education either for their financial conditions or for their lack of interests in schools, and oftentimes, for both. To help them continue their education, the government must adopt a policy to support their families financially. Incentives should be given both to needy families and to meritorious poor students. School authority, along with the support from the government, can implement it to improve the situation. For instance, free-education and scholarship policies adopted by the authority in many Asian and African countries have reduced their illiteracy rate significantly over the years, and it has improved their employment and social conditions.
	Furthermore, education has to be interactive and fun for young students so that they enjoy going to school. A friendly school environment, sports and entertainment facilities, delicious and healthy meals, and support from teachers can be crucial factors to attach students to their school activities. Surveys reveal that when learners show interests to continue their schools, parents try their best to support the costs. Finally, the government should build many night schools so that young students who have not finished their education get a chance to continue their education. Those schools are vital to give school-leavers a second chance to improve their qualification while also keep them away from activities that are subversive for society.
	In conclusion, when young students leave schools prematurely, it not only affects their future but also the whole society. To reverse this unfortunate situation, the government and schools authorities are expected to work together. Only then we can expect the true progress of our nation.

Essay 127:
	With the ever-increasing competitions and demands in life, a child’s family, school and society, as a whole, expect too much from the child. While it is important to excel in schools, sports, social activities and in other aspects of life, those children should be shielded from the mounting pressures by maintaining a balance in their life. Otherwise, the expectation would act as a boomerang and hamper the development of a child.
	The world has become far more competitive than ever before. For instance, I did not have to compete with anyone to get admitted to my primary school but my nephew had to take an entrance exam to get enrolled in the same school, and just one in every twelve applicants was successful. Besides, we had plenty of time to enjoy in schools while this is different for today's young pupils. They attend classes, take extra coaching, go to music and art schools and read many books and all these activities are meant to fulfil their parents' dream and school's expectations. Parents want their children to be top scorers in school, math geniuses, as well as great soccer players and renowned artists. The problem is that it is not a rational and practical expectation. Moreover, the commercialisation of products which targets young children is another problem we need to address.  
	We have to draw a line in our expectations and find out the true potentials of a child rather than pushing them constantly. The state should discourage having an entrance exam in elementary school and have sufficient funds to ensure proper entertainment and sports facilities in academies. Teachers should not pressurize children to do homework every day, and they should try to make school a place to learn in a fun way. Furthermore, social perspectives to prepare every boy or girl to become a doctor, engineer or a higher-wage-earning professional should change.
	To conclude, children today are being pushed beyond their limits to achieve academic, social and professional success, and this has unfathomable negative consequences. Parents and teachers should find the hidden talent of a child, not try to make them something they are not meant to be.

Essay 128:
	Developing a sense of discipline among children is an important responsibility for parents as it determines a child’s future and the overall social condition. However, many parents can not share quality time with their children due to career pressure and those couples, oftentimes, fail to teach children moral values. This has undeniably lead to some juvenile delinquencies including disciplinary problems. I firmly believe that parents should spend more time with their offsprings and teach them through examples to reverse this trend.
	To begin with, when children, as a whole, in a society, become disruptive, they are not the ones to be blamed. Parents are the first teachers and perhaps the most reliable ones in times of a child’s joy and vulnerability, and they have to spend time with their children. Ideal parents teach their children good rules and set examples to meet the expectation of parenthood. Lessons learned from parents shape a child’s character and this is why psychologists emphasize so much on good parenting. Career and social status are important, but not more than the future of a child and this is why parents should maintain a balance in their professional and family life.
	Once a child becomes rogue, the parents are the persons to suffer the most. Due to the relationship between upbringing and the future of a child, fathers and mothers should instil good moral values in a child in the early stage of their life, not regret when it is already too late.
	To conclude, many parents leave their children on their own only to miss their chance to make them ideal citizens of the society. No matter how alluring the career prospects are, good parents should always make time to share with their boys and girls and teach them important lessons about life, including the importance of discipline.

Essay 129:
	Technology, globalization, tourism and open trade policy have brought nations together and some people dream to have a world with no cultural and communication barriers. The expert opinion of having a new single international language for all nations thus has developed. Despite its appeal, I believe that it would be a futile step as the world already has an international language- English.
	The increasing conglomeration of nations, the upsurge of globalisation and the widespread use of modern technology have tremendously increased people’s need to communicate with each other and thus some linguistics express their view on introducing a new global language. However, the real picture is quite different from the expectation as linguistics have already failed to establish an artificially formed universal language despite their efforts and arguments several times.
	Moreover, English, the most widely used language for international communication, is already in place and has many rich features. Besides, some people use other international languages like Spanish and French, and except some culturally biased people, all have accepted English as their mean to communicate with people from other countries. This model is already working pretty well and the idea of patching an already functional system would add more distresses.
	Over the last millennia, English as an international language has already infiltrated the territories due to geopolitical reasons and cultural encouragements. A language is not merely a collection of letters and words; rather it is a result of the evolution of society, constant research and experience of mass people. Thus no matter how easy the newly introduced language is made, it will lack the fundamental quality of a rich language. People in favour of presenting a new global language often opine that the new language would be culturally neutral and morally correct to be the common linguistic ground for still divided humanity. As fair as it may sound, such an opinion lacks rationality. English is already doing fine and inventing a new language and having it functional would bring unnecessary distress and effort, and it will more likely fail as it did in the past.
	To conclude, the world needs a unified language for many reasons but introducing a new one is the least ideal solution of all. The natural flow of English as a global language has already filled the gap and we no longer need to add unnecessary misery to people to experiment with a seemingly ineffective idea.

Essay 130:
	Traditionally people get married to someone of the same culture, religion and country. But marrying in a different culture has become common and socially accepted these days. Technological advancements, changes in social belief, and freedom for choosing a life partner among young have accelerated this trend and many of these cross-cultural marriages indeed are working too well.
	To begin with, people, these days, use technology to make friends across the border. An increasing number of people also study abroad and live in a cross-cultural environment. This has broken their outdated social belief to a great extent, and they have a broader perspective of life and marriage. Moreover, young people have greater freedoms in choosing their life partners unlike in the past when parents primarily picked a bride or bridegroom for someone. Modern society also seems to have accepted this freedom and welcome marriage beyond the known boundary.
	Cross-cultural marriage has several benefits. People have different inherent features and strength based on their culture, race, geographic location and family and it is often noticed that children of such cross-cultural couples are stronger and have diverse capabilities. Two people from totally different cultures, when get married, take time to understand each other and this often strengthens their conjugal relationship. They learn about other’s tradition, culture, belief, language and this opens up an entirely new world for them. Such marriage often teaches people to become more tolerant of other races, culture and custom and it often helps people to discover themselves from a neutral point of view rather than the biased view of inherent culture and tradition.
	This type of marriage has some disadvantages too. Family, friends and relatives often have misconceptions of such couples and keep their distance. Mixed marriages often force people to accept an alien way of life that they cannot completely cope with. Children in such families often find it hard to adhere to a particular culture and end up adopting a pseudo-cultural identity. Finally, such marriage often ends in a bitter experience as couples fail to understand each other properly.
	To conclude, mix-cultural marriages are nowadays more accepted in our society than in the past. Social changes, technology and people’s freedom to choose a life partner have greatly made it possible. Despite some problems, this type of marriage is working too well to consider it a mainstream trend.

Essay 131:
	Differences between nations in terms of their lifestyle, food habit, fashion, choices and traditions have already reduced to a great extent with the effects of globalisation, technology and international agreements for open trade facilities. Since most of the international products are easily accessible globally, people have far more choices and freedom which have enhanced people's lifestyle besides narrowing the gaps among nations. I postulate this trend as a positive development and the reasons are explained in this essay.
	To begin with, the availability of international brands like Apple, Google, Nike, Pepsi, Johnson's, Samsung, Nestle, Unilever, Amazon, Toyota etc. in a country enables consumers to purchase quality products. For instance, someone in India can use the same technological products from Intel and Microsoft that an American uses and it facilitates reducing gaps between these two countries. 'Barrier & gaps' among nations was a predominant reason for conflicts and with the advancement of technology and mutual trade agreements, nations now know about the foreign cultures more than they did ever before. This diminishes the world tension and helps prevail the peace. Furthermore, affluent countries have created a vast market for consumer products and this has helped them establish offshore offices and factories in developing nations. This is a mutually beneficial agreement that helps both parties.
	Furthermore, local consumers are not trapped with the low-quality local products and wider freedom lets them enjoy a better lifestyle. With the competition, local manufacturers are forced to produce quality products at a competitive price. With this development, some local companies have gained international recognition as a manufacturer.
	To conclude, barriers and gaps among nations divide people and create a master-slave relationship as we have already witnessed in history. The present era has plummeted this heinous trend to a great extent and the similar lifestyle and availability of international products have helped this to happen.

Essay 132:
	How much freedom should be granted to children on everyday matters is controversial. People who are against allowing boundless liberty to children believe that it would create selfish individuals in our society. Others, however, think freedom is necessary to nurture the creativity of children and it creates self-reliant individuals. I believe that parents should neither give absolute privilege to their children nor restrain them in every matter - there must be a balance.
	On the one hand, permitting children to do whatever they want and letting them chose everything they like would convince youngsters that they can do whatever they like. This is detrimental to the mental growth of children and those children would likely become selfish and self-centred when they grow up. Scientific research reveals that someone’s childhood experience has a permanent effect on his personality and thinking pattern. This is why parents should make important decisions for their offsprings and deter them from doing things that are harmful to their psychological and physical growth as well as for others.
	On the other hand, psychologists express that if parents do not allow their children to pick certain things on their own and restrict them on everything, the children would become fragile-minded and definitely lack confidence. If children cannot choose things they like and do not have any freedom of choice, would end up being less creative than those who were given the freedom to make their own decisions.
	To conclude, our society needs more creative and selfless people and that is why we should allow freedom to our child, but there should be a boundary between this liberty and freedom of choice. The balance can bring the best possible results.

Essay 133:
	People, in some countries, prefer to have a fast and extensive rail transportation system while others think that improving the existing road transportation system is far more important and that is why more budget should be spent on roads. This essay discusses both views. Personally, I am in favour of developing and enhancing both.
	On the one hand, people in favour of having a speedy and reliable train communication system mainly base their ground on the fact that trains can carry a large number of passengers and goods at a time and can remarkably reduce traffic congestion. Rail communication is safer, faster and can connect cities and towns that build a better connection than the conventional road transport system, according to these people. Furthermore, locomotives are already famous in many countries and have greatly improved communications there. Due to such advantages, people often opine that more money should be allocated for constructing new fast train lines. For instance, the train system in China and Russia both have a groundbreaking contribution to improving their overall communication systems and many countries have started adopting this model.
	On the other hand, the public transport system plays an essential role in interconnecting the different parts of the cities and most people use this system to travel to different places. Though trains can improve the city transport facilities, it is not an alternative to the existing road transports. That is why many people believe that the national budget should be utilised on improving public transport for the sake of better communication for mass people. For instance, the train line in the UK has always contributed to a great extent to the overall transport system in the country. Nevertheless, public transport has always been the main commuting mode for UK citizens.
	To conclude, I believe that the national budget should be fairly distributed for the improvement of the fast and new rail system as well as public transports for the overall expansion and improvement of the transportation system in a country.

Essay 134:
	The education system, in most of the countries, is mainly supported by the government while private schools are expensive as private organisations maintain them. Some people opine that parents who send their children to private schools should be exempted from paying tax for state education. I, however, disagree with this proposed policy.
	First of all, the government does not force people to send their children to private schools. When people decide to send their children to private schools, they accept the higher fee willingly. From a practical point of view, affluent citizens send their children to private schools, and they are higher taxpayers. If they do not support state education, the government would have a hard time managing the state-supported education system. Besides, a double standard in tax would create an outcry among the populace. Secondly, all citizens should spontaneously pay the education tax to fulfil their duty to the country. The money collected through tax is used to run the education system of the country, and that is why taxpayers have a natural obligation to contribute to the state-run education system.
	Finally, not all citizens utilise the services provided to the public by the taxpayers' money. For instance, many city-dwellers always turn to private health care services despite they pay taxes for the state-owned medical facilities. This is why dual tax policy for individuals who send their offspring to a private school would deteriorate the whole tax collecting system.
	In conclusion, I strongly support that every eligible citizen, no matter whether they send their children to public or private schools, should pay the tax. This is the best way to keep education free for poor parents and affordable for middle-class people.

Essay 135:
	Cities offer many conveniences and opportunities that are not present in rural areas, but these things do not come without a cost. Higher living costs, pollutions, loosely relationship among people and frantic competition often make cities difficult to live in. The government has a lot to do to improve the lifestyle of the city dwellers.
	The overwhelming expense is the main problem for anyone who moves to a city from a small town. The cost of education, treatment, house rent, food and daily commodities are far higher in a city. Pollution in cities is the second most severe issue and it makes metropolitan areas less suitable for children to grow up. People in big cities live in a contaminated area where the CO2 emission, the presence of carbon and other toxic elements in the air is higher. Another drawback of living in a city is the social classification and gap between rich and poor. Social discriminations in city areas are far higher than in the other parts of the country.
	Moreover, people in small towns and villages have an exceptional connection and they know each other very well, which is quite the opposite in a city. Moreover, municipal life is full of competition and it makes people’s life miserable. Someone has to compete to get in a public car, wait for his turn to meet the doctor, wait several hours in the traffic jam and fight hard to get a decent job. The competition is so high that even a child has to go through a tough fight to be accepted into a school.   
	In conclusion, the government should take initiatives to improve people's living standard in cities and make sure rural areas and towns have plenty of job opportunities to reduce the pressure on big cities.

Essay 136:
	Waste recycling is a widely discussed issue around the globe, but even after numerous global initiatives and continuous announcements, people seem to react whimsically to this. Many opine that people tend to abide by something only when there are rules and legal obligations. This is why waste recycling should be made a law and mandatory to adhere to, in my opinion.
	To begin with, waste recycling help save the environment and the process reuses many valuable materials. Some household garbage contains detrimental ingredients and can cause harm to the environment. If every homeowner takes the responsibility to participate in waste recycling, waste management as well as preserving a green environment would become easier. However, this is not the case and many people still ignore this. Thus comes the question of whether making it a law would force people to participate more and save the environment. I strongly believe this will.
	Naturally, people have a tendency to ignore many important tasks - be it for themselves or society as a whole. They are sometimes as careless as crossing the busy streets instead of taking the overpass or underpass, though the latter one is safer. On the contrary, when legal obligations and punishment for an act are in place, the number of participants seems like increases dramatically. For instance, when crossing busy streets instead of using the underpass in some cities have been made a legal offence, the number of road accidents decreased significantly over time. Similarly, when the government would make recycling mandatory by imposing laws, people would participate more in this. This is so sensitive an issue that this should have already been a part of the law.
	In fact, the main objective of the law is to deter people from doing something bad and punish offenders to maintain a peaceful society. Since waste recycling is directly related to our environment and the well-being of our future generation, we should make it a legal responsibility so that people do not ignore this important task.
	In conclusion, law and rules exist to encourage and somewhat force people to follow the good trends and avoid bad practices. Since people are not spontaneously participating in waste recycling and the amount of garbage they produce is increasing, the government must have defined rules and legislation to control it for the benefit of all.

Essay 137:
	The proportion of elderly people in some countries, like Japan, is considerably higher while in some other regions, including some Asian and Western countries, young people comprise the highest percentage of the total population. Having a larger proportion of youth is considered to have more advantages for a country, and I think that a country should have more active youths for faster development.
	To begin with, the young generation is dynamic, energetic, and can contribute to the job sector which has a huge positive impact on the economic development of the country. They come with fresh ideas and are free from old superstitions and traditional beliefs. It gives them a competitive advantage. The educated young generation is the best resource a country can have, and their contribution to the country is significantly higher than the participation of children and elder people. The contribution of the older people, however, could not be denied and they have already done their part for reforming the country. They have vast experience and wisdom that are vital for decision making. They are often considered a better fit for the decision-making positions.
	Moreover, children are the future of a country, and the elderly have already played their roles. On the contrary, the young generation is the active workforce and can lead to the overall growth of the country. They are active citizens in society while children and senior peoples are dependent on others. The young generation can learn things faster and can share ideas, and this is why they are better leaders. The ICT sector, for instance, is full of fresh minds and is globally led by young minds. The ICT sector is considered to be the most prominent sector for the development of a country, especially in this technological era, and it highlights the importance of young and fresh minds over elder people in a country.
	To conclude, older people should not be considered a burden for the country, however, the young have more to contribute to society and the country as a whole. This is why it is more beneficial for a country to have an active workforce than dependent senior citizens.

Essay 138:
	Fish population in seas, lakes and rivers are falling sharply and over-fishing is the main reason for this. Many Asian and European countries had plenty of fish species, but these days many fish species have become numbered. Overall, this has terrible impacts. Without imposing strict laws to stop uncontrolled fishing, while also investing money in improving the natural habitats of fishes, we will bear great losses.
	Fishes, in many parts of the world, are caught early and they do not get time to grow and reproduce. Without the government’s initiatives and proper policy, the condition will deteriorate as the greedy fishers would not spare any fish from their nets. As a consequence, marine life would lose its balance and many fish species would get extinct. To prevent it, the government must have strong surveillance to stop catching baby fishes.
	As a direct result of over-fishing, many popular fish species have become very expensive and rare. For instance, Hilsha, the national fish of Bangladesh, is facing an acute threat of over-fishing and have become numbered. This has a negative economic impact as the country used to export this fish to many western countries. Besides, due to the exhaustive and indiscriminating fishing, many rivers, lakes and canals are void of fishes and more fishermen are finding it hard to live by fishing. Many governments have already taken steps by declaring many rivers, sea areas and canals restricted and marking commercial fishing prohibited in certain seasons, and this is making the livelihood of many fishermen even harder.
	In conclusion, over-fishing must be stopped now and the government must decide to bring changes to save fish species. Besides, the population who live by fishing must also fish prudently and always spare the baby and mother fishes for their own benefit.

Essay 139:
	Globalisation is sweeping away all the differences and boundaries among nations. The buzzword globalisation refers to the freeing up of markets, free flow of goods and information and as a result, the traditional barriers among nations are gradually breaking down and the world is becoming closer in terms of cultural and economic relations. So, I believe that, as a natural process, the culture of different countries are blending together and a country is adopting foreign cultures faster than ever.
	These days some countries are experiencing rapid cultural changes and the culture of a dominating country is being adopted by the people of other countries. For instance, due to the spread of Indian TV channels and their Bombay-centric flamboyant Hindi cultures, many SAARC countries are on the verge of losing their century-old cultural uniqueness in the films and fashion industries. Interestingly, Indian culture is also being influenced by more dominating Hollywood.
	Moreover, in the age of globalisation, countries are seeking greater cooperation and the spirit is a greater flow of commodities, information and people across the borders of different countries. Mass media and technology have played an even greater role in promoting the norm of globalisation and people these days are aware of the cultural presence of other countries. The tourist influx in different countries is creating a mixed cultural global village where no country is unique, rather they all have a mixed culture.
	Some people treat this as a natural process while others take it as a threat to their own cultural identity. I believe that cultures are dynamic and living phenomena. Culture, what we know today, was different in the past and that is why we should not be too much wary of changes. Even before globalisation swept in, we started celebrating the 31st December and Valentine’s Day, which is completely foreign to our culture. This is the era of free information exchange and if we stop international cooperation for the sake of our cultural identity, our progress would stop overnight.
	In conclusion, free trade and the global market is such a powerful concept that it cannot be stopped anymore. Keeping the window of progress is better than keeping them close even if this means inheriting foreign cultures.

Essay 140:
	Some environmental problems are regional like cyclones, and some others are global - greenhouse effects, for instance. With the span of time, many environmental problems are becoming global issues, and I believe that global initiatives will bring the best result. It will also make the world a better place to live in.
	To begin with, environmental problems are generally caused by humans and while some of them are national in nature, most of them are global issues. Noise or water pollution at a time remain national problems but after a certain period, it would turn into a problem for the whole world. Thus if some environmental problems are left unaddressed due to its span in a country, it would soon become a problem for all nations.
	Moreover, not all nations are equally qualified to address issues of such magnitude due to their economic and political aspects and this is why other affluent nations should extend their helping hands to solve such problems. Rich nations cause more global warming and this is why they need to build a common platform to bring all nations together to fight environmental problems. For a poor country, it is quite tough to allocate a budget for saving the greenery while millions of its population are suffering from hunger and natural disaster. This is why other rich nations have natural obligations to help those poor or developing nations.
	To draw the conclusion, global environmental problems like greenhouse effects, global warming etc. have already become a concern for every nation. A collaborative effort to address these problems would be a better strategy as each nation is not equally adept to solve global problems.
Essay 141:
	Environmental problems greatly vary in terms of their magnitudes, and some of these are local, while others are definitely global in nature - the greenhouse effect or global warming for example. For the best result, these sort of problems should be addressed at the most appropriate levels, sometimes even at multiple levels.
	To begin with, some environmental problems are generally caused by a group of people in a particular region and these issues get accelerated by the rapid expansion of industrialisation in this region. These sorts of problems often include noise pollution, air pollution, deforestation, intoxicating waste disposal etc. and these are generally national in nature. It is better to address these types of environmental problems at the national level and educating people is a viable solution in this scenario. International aid sometimes can help a poor or developing country to address environmental problems but the government of the country should take initiatives to solve such national problems.
	Having said that, some environmental problems, for instance, common river, coastline or sea pollution concerns more than one countries and those sorts of problems should be addressed at a bilateral level. Similarly, if an environmental problem concerns a large region, for instance, a continent, that should be discussed and fought by the countries that are located on this continent. Some common examples of this type of environmental problems are desertification, soil erosion, aridness and floods.  
	Finally, some environmental problems pervade across national boundaries and calls for multinational or global collaboration. For example, radioactive industrial wastages in oceans, ozone layer degradation, global warming are global issues and these types of problems should be addressed by every single nation in the world. For greater success and effectiveness, I believe that the commitment of countries, especially rich nations, is quite important.
	To conclude, environmental problems should be viewed as a common problem for mankind and those global problems should be endorsed and shared globally by all nations. Similarly, rich nationals should help developing nations to fight their regional and national environmental problems for the best result.

	In recent years, many schools have included technology-related subjects while dropped traditional subjects from the school syllabus. Whether old subjects should be replaced by modern ones is a matter of great debate. I believe it is a difficult question to answer, and different schools should adopt different solutions.
	Some believe that traditional subjects should be retained as part of the school curriculum as they have great values for the students. According to them, school education is not merely a process to ensure a future job. This is rather a broader aspect, and to build an enlightened future generation, we need more cultural and arts-related subjects than technical ones. Another group of people believe that technical subjects are more important than arts and sports-related subjects as they not only ensure better learning for students but guarantee jobs in the future also. From a more practical point of view, technical knowledge is more important in life, and this is why many people and guardians support the change in the school curriculum.
	In conclusion, the school curriculum is a sensitive issue, and that should be very carefully planned. Modern subjects should be introduced, no doubt, but this should not make the traditional and old subjects obsolete.

Essay 143:
	These days we no longer completely rely on locally grown food as we can now purchase food grown in some distant land whenever we want. Though this trend has some benefits as it widens our freedom as consumers, it has some severe disadvantages which makes it a dangerous trend.
	We live in a global village, and with the introduction of the speedy transportation system, food grown anywhere could be transported to other parts of the world. It ensures that people can buy many types of local and foreign fruits, vegetables and other food items from the nearby markets. "If something is not locally grown, import it" - globalisation has made it a reality. It also fosters international trade, helps many farmers reach the international market and help countries fight their food scarcity. However, this does not come without a price.
	The transportation of food requires burning more fuel, and this is detrimental to the environment. Just to supply internationally grown fruits, we are degrading our environment. This is a price we cannot afford to pay. Another negative impact of transporting food is putting the local farmers into the competition, and they are forced to produce more items at a lower cost and hence the increasing use of chemicals. This, in a way, is declining the quality of locally grown food items.
	Furthermore, consumers are often forced to purchase imported food that was preserved and produced with the use of chemicals and preservatives. They are harmful to our health, and people are purchasing those items at a higher price. Importers cannot ensure the freshness and proper nutrition of imported food. Local sellers also preserve them for several days. This makes it less nutritious and less fresh than the locally produced fruits and vegetables.
	In conclusion, I believe that transporting food over a long distance is undesirable and have more negative consequences than positive ones. It threatens our local farmers and chemically preserved fruits and vegetables that are being imported is not a healthy choice at all.

Essay 144:
	Youth drug abuse is perhaps the most wicked and concerning issue both the poor and rich nations suffer equally. Many young talents are wasted and families destroyed due to drug abuse. Not only the illegal drugs are being misused, but also the youth's experiment with illegal substances are on the rise. Suggesting accurate remedies for that problem requires a clear understanding of the underlying reasons and this essay will attempt it.
	To note down the possible reasons for youth drug abuse, we need to consider the availability of these drugs and many corrupted law officers first. According to several news reports and investigations, the law-enforcing department has a list of all drug dealers and possible spots where illegal drugs are sold. If this is the case, why they are yet to wipe out the illegal drug business from the city is a big question! No doubt, money and corruption play a role here. Besides, some people say that family bonding in modern life is not as close as it used to be. Due to family issues and pressure, many young people start abusing drugs. Initially, they find it a relief but soon get trapped. Thirdly, the lack of proper counselling and teenagers curiosity drive many of them to try new drugs. Bad companies who are on drugs can influence many youths to start it. Finally, public advertisements, magazines and movies that depict smoking and drinking positively can attract young minds. They often try to mimic their favourite actors and this is just the beginning that ends in substance-abusing.
	Personally, I would like to suggest that the authority should try to wipe out the illegal drug businesses from the country. If the illegal drug business is closed, teenagers would not be curious to try them. Another way to tackle this issue is by having better family bonding and parents spending quality time with their children. Finally, all sorts of public advertisement for tobacco or alcohol should be completely banned.
	To conclude, hopefully, the day not far away when we will have no young drug abuser in our society and this can be achieved by us - as a parent, as a teacher, as a friend and finally as a law-enforcing officer. If we play our roles properly, we will have a better society, which is free of any illegal drugs and drug addicts.

Essay 145:
	After getting admitted to a university, students need to decide where to live, and this choice severely affects their academic performance and student life. While many disciples choose university halls, others opt to live in an apartment, and it has both benefits and demerits. This essay examines both advantages and disadvantages of living in a separate apartment than living in a university residence. Personally, I would prefer to live in a university residence.
	Living in an apartment offers many distinct advantages, and privacy is one of them. While a student in a dormitory has little privacy, someone in an apartment enjoys far better privacy and freedom. Learners who live in an independent house can choose a quiet neighbourhood, and this environment is conducive for studying attentively. Furthermore, living in an apartment makes students more independent, and they can choose a better diet. For instance, one of my cousins moved to an apartment after living in a university dormitory for about six months, and he did so because he hated the food offered in his university canteen.
	Having said that, living in an apartment rather than a university dormitory has some visible disadvantages. First and foremost is the cost. In my country, living in an apartment is quite expensive while the university offers cheap accommodation. The food is also cheaper in the university dining halls. Second, renting an apartment in my city is hard for a student. The landlords prefer families over the students. Furthermore, the daily commuting is convenient from the university halls while not so easy from the apartments away from the university campus. Finally, campus staying students have better interaction with seniors and teachers.
	In conclusion, even though there are many benefits of living in an apartment than living in a university hall, I would still prefer to live in the university dormitory. The primary reason for me to be able to attend my classes without commuting through bad traffics. I hate to wait in the heavy traffic and as I do not own a car. I would also like to enjoy my university life and stay in touch with my seniors, teachers and classmates whenever possible. University life has so many things to offer, and I do not want to miss them.

Essay 146:
	The world already has an unendurable population and the highest percentages of them live in Asia and Africa. Poverty, corruption, pollution and diseases are epidemic in these parts of the world and the higher populace is the main reason for it. If the population in these two continents are not controlled, the problems would completely get out of hand and this essay suggests some ways of curbing the expansion of the population.
	The terribly higher population density, poverty, unemployment and other social problems have already made it tough for Asian and African countries to progress and the increasing population growth makes the future even more uncertain there. Higher population in some developed countries are seen as a blessing while it is not the case in most of the Asian and African countries as most of their citizens are uneducated and unskilled.
	To control the population, the first step has to come from the government. The authority should restrict the number of children a family can have, and violation of this policy should be severely punished. Countries like China have already adopted this policy and have been able to control their population to a certain extent. Besides, the citizens have to realise the negative effects of the uncontrolled population and spontaneously take birth control measures. Without the support of the ordinary population, the government alone cannot control it. Above all, international organisations like WHO, UNDP and other humanitarian organisation should work in these countries to educate people about the negative consequences of the higher population growth. Besides, they should provide funds for birth control in these countries.
	In conclusion, the higher population in poor countries is a big threat, and, oftentimes, the main hindrance to true progress. The government, ordinary people and international organisations should work together to control the rapid population growth in these countries. Without a combination of policy, awareness and a free flow of funds, it would be impossible to help those countries control their population.

The population growth in these regions is uncontrollable due to ignorance, poor quality of life, and the religious and social taboo against population control. In this essay, I will briefly suggest some issues that overpopulation causes, and then suggest some ways to control it.
	Overpopulation causes a complex set of problems that negatively affects the quality of life. It also increases crime, pollution and corruption. Increasing population creates more pressure on the already limited resources in the poor and developing countries and an upsurge in population will simply make the situation worse. Unemployment, inadequate infrastructure, poverty, malnutrition, low literacy rates and high competition already make the citizens suffer a lot, and if the population growth is not controlled, it will make things worse day by day.
	Controlling the population in a country can not be achieved overnight, and despite initiatives and educational campaigns, the result might come at a slow pace. However, proper steps should be taken to control the rapid expansion of the population. First, the authority should take initiatives and launch awareness campaigns more frequently, especially among the poor citizens, to educate them about the negative consequences of having many children. Making contraceptives available for free among the poor population should be ensured. Finally, the government must impose laws to restrict the number of children a family can have. For instance, families in China are not allowed to have more than one child, and any violation of it incites financial penalty. This may seem cruel at first but the one-child policy has already given positive outcomes to many populous countries.
	In conclusion, if the population keeps increasing at the current rate, the world would soon find itself in the verse of war for food, shelter and medicine. So the time has come to take every possible step to tackle the heinous speed of population growth, and authorities and citizens should work together to tackle it.

Essay 148:
	Developing countries have great potentials to accelerate their progress, and they want to achieve it faster, even if it means that they need to shift their economic focus. Though it is not accepted by all that a country can develop if it focuses on expanding industries rather than agriculture, I personally believe that a developing country like Bangladesh should have a well-conceived industrialisation strategy like Japan, China or Hong Kong to become a developed country.
	Agriculture, undeniably, is an important sector for a country like Bangladesh where more than 70% of people rely on it. However,  agriculture alone cannot enlist a country as an advanced nation in this modern era. The industrial revolution has taught us that manual labour and agricultural products cannot singly improve the economic condition of a nation. And a country must have an export-oriented industry or great industrial hub to progress quickly. For instance, a poor country has to export several hundreds of tonnes of grains to import only a few numbers of modern machinery. This disparity will keep on enhancing if the nation cannot become industrially sufficient. Asian economy has already shifted from farming and fishing to industrialisation and no developing country can further progress without following the same pathway, as the research suggests.
	While agricultural development should not be ignored, especially in countries like Bangladesh, industrialisation should get more priority. Diversifying the agricultural products and exports is a great power for an agricultural-based country, but this takes a long way to reach the top and with the revolution and rapid expansion of the industrial world, this has become quite challenging, in a practical world.
	To conclude, an agriculture-dependent country like Bangladesh should try to diversify its agricultural sector to become self-sufficient in its food supply but must have a long-term industrial strategy to progress and become a developed nation.

Essay 149:
	For more than a century, traditional examination to assess student’s ability was in place and this is still in use in many parts of the world. However, a more suitable and modern approach has been adopted by many schools, and this is often regarded as a better technique to evaluate a pupil’s learning ability and knowledge. I personally believe that the innovative modern assessment technique is more suitable.
	To begin with, the conventional exam system has a major flaw which is its inadequacy to evaluate the true knowledge of pupils. For instance, in the conventional paper-based exam system, students can memorise answers to a few questions and pass the exam with a good grade. Someone with little knowledge of a subject can get a higher grade by memorising answers. On the contrary, innovative approaches like group assignments, sudden quiz, hands-on tests etc. can reflect the actual level of student’s learning. This is why many educational institutions are shifting towards these assessment techniques from the traditional exam system and I really believe that this will, in the future, become the main evaluation technique in schools.
	Moreover, the paper-based exam system allows students to cheat the exam and pass it without even studying hard. On the contrary, a student would not be able to pass a hands-on test or an open-book exam where he needs to propose a solution to a problem rather than writing answers from books. From my experience, I can tell that I had to study more to pass the sudden class tests than my term-finals as I had no clue what teachers would assess on these sudden tests. Many schools have already introduced a few innovative assessment techniques due to their experience from the traditional tests and their limitations. The latest methods are in place because they are more suitable.
	To conclude, the right technique to evaluate students is an important issue, and no stone should be unturned to introduce the most effective way of doing it. Something is missing in the conventional exam system, and I believe this is where the modern methods of evaluating fits in.
Essay 150:
	To begin with, formal examinations, in many cases, do not reflect a pupil’s true ability and knowledge. Examination or any assessment criteria is meant to scrutinize a student objectively, but a formal test fails to do it, especially because it involved memorise-and-pass technique. Further, formal exams do not consider someone’s health condition on the exam date and thus is unsuitable for many. Some students take more time to produce any result and though they take a longer time, they have a better result in producing capability. Traditional exams would also score these sorts of students poorly.
	On the other hand, the unconventional assessment systems to test a student’s skill and knowledge can be quite effective and bring out a better result. For instance, oral presentation, assignments, sudden quizzes, class tests, course work, and other modern methods of evaluation can examine students from various perspectives and when the result is combined, the indication is far more accurate. These tests scrutinise a learner’s creativity, depth of knowledge, creativity, ability to use the knowledge in the practical world, and are important parameters of a student’s reasoning and reflection of learning ability.
	In conclusion, evaluating a learner accurately is important and the best method for this should be in place. No doubt the formal examination system had been used for a long but the time has come to adopt a more accurate and practical assessment system and hence the shift towards a combination of innovative assessment systems is inevitable.

Essay 151:
	To begin with, though traditional cities are initially planned to have commercial buildings located in the centre of the city, to be away from the main residential area, in a few years, the structure of the city changes and it becomes a more unplanned city than ever. It is natural that parents would prefer to send their children to a nearby school while shoppers would love to shop from around the corner. As a consequence, residential areas at a time become semi-commercial areas and traffic congestion kills people’s valuable time. In such cities, pollution increases and a few percentages of landlords get higher commercial rents while others do not.
	On the contrary, if cities have saturated commercial settings, it will assure balanced residential and commercial establishments and city dwellers would be greatly benefitted from it. The house rent would be fair and the traffic condition on the roads would be far better. Furthermore, the authority would have control over the future expansion of the area and face fewer difficulties to ensure the necessary facilities for the local people.
	To conclude, the modern city planning that supports the location of commercial entities and public services to be built in various areas of the city rather than having those altogether offers numerous advantages to the local authorities including better traffic condition, more reliable public facilities, fair rent and future expansion of the city.

Essay 152:
	We started living in a cave, as history suggests, and thanks to the novelty and advancement of modern technology that we now live in a grand apartment with many facilities which were unimaginable even a century ago. From an uncertain life where our ancestors had to deal with constant fears of darkness and lurking predators, we have a remarkably comfortable and advanced lifestyle and this has all been possible due to technological advancements.
	It is often argued by many that modern technology has given us comfort but has cost us dearly. As an example, they point out that we have become less active and more dependent on machines, especially on household appliances. According to them, this is a backward step and apparatuses cannot improve our lifestyle. What they fail to realise is that the blessing of science has eradicated many deadly diseases that had often wiped out cities and made us vulnerable like ants in the water. Advancement in technology is not a one-dimensional straight line, it is a spark of light, and without it, we would still be at the mercy of natural calamities. People may blame science for the contamination of food or the advent of fast food, but it is worth mentioning that without science, we would have a world war for the food crisis.
	The household appliances like washing machines and vacuum cleaners have reduced the manual labour of cleaning while rice cookers, microwave ovens, coffee makers and electric kettles have improved the way we cook at home. We no longer need to end our day when the sun sets as electric bulbs illuminate the world. Thus, it is easy to criticise the innovation and wonder science has brought to our life but living without them is utterly impossible. For instance, imagine what the world would be without electricity, refrigerators, TVs and the internet - unimaginable even for a day.
	To conclude, it is undeniable that modern household appliances have made our tasks easier, faster and more accurate. With this, we have a better lifestyle and more time to spend with our family members or to enjoy our leisure activities.
Essay 153:
	Innovations of science have touched the lives of billions as most homes, these days, have at least a washing machine, refrigerator, microwave oven, and air conditioner, and these tools have profoundly enhanced the way people live their life. Yet, the negative effects of this dependency cannot be denied.
	To begin with, these household appliances save a great deal of time and human labour and this is simply amazing. People no longer need to work all day long to finish their works, and as a result, people can have more quality times. This is definitely a great leap towards modernisation and a significant enhancement of their lifestyle. For instance, most women in the past century had to remain busy at home but these days they can spend more leisure time and this has all been possible due to the advents of modern household appliances.
	However, modern technology cannot ensure a better lifestyle by all means and in many cases, it deteriorates our lifestyle. For instance, TV is considered to be a wonder box in most houses. Due to our addiction to TV, we have little time to talk with other family members. This is not the desired state at all but an example of how machines can negatively affect our lifestyle. Moreover, the modern technology used for preparing food and drinks are not always safe and cannot be compared with the hygiene and food value we used to get from food when they were collected from natural sources and made manually. For instance, the burger, sandwich or ice cream made at home are not as nutritious as our grandmother’s cookies or cakes were.
	We can, therefore, conclude that technology is a blessing for us and at the same time if we do not use it sensibly, it might bring a curse for us as well. This is why, we will have to determine the limit of its usages, even at home, to make our lifestyle standard as well as safe.

Essay 154:
	The recent political unrest, war and the rise of a few terrorist groups have made many people become refugees and this is a global problem. As an immediate solution, many express their view that rich countries should allow more evacuees to enter their border to reduce the severity of this crisis. However, accepting a higher number of migrants by the developed countries is not a viable solution to this refugee crisis, in my opinion.
	To begin with, worldwide refugees and their constant sufferings are often reported on TV. It might seem that industrialised countries can easily solve this emergency and miseries by allowing more refugees to enter their countries. In reality, this is certainly not an easy solution. If we only look at the few recent catastrophic events that the migrant refugees have caused, it would become clear why the governments in developed countries are unwavering to accept more people to their countries. Besides, historically, it is evident that only granting more refugees in other countries does not solve the problem, in some cases, it deteriorates it.
	It is true that, due to humanitarian reasons, some developed countries should help destitute and needy people. This is partly a moral issue and partly because it is in the self-economic interest of the industrialised countries. Considering this, a practical way of reducing the severity of this crisis would be to accept more refugees, particularly when it is caused by a natural disaster and civil war.
	But, from a more practical point of view, mass immigrations would bring more negative effects. Solving the root cause of the outbreaks of refugees is a far better way than allowing them freely migrate to developed countries. On a practical level, homeless refugees are sometimes better off receiving aid in their homeland than suffering racism and begging on the streets in a country where they cannot speak the language.
	To conclude, rich countries should take refugees but only in extreme cases and should focus on solving the primary reason behind the refugee issue. Sometimes funds and aids for refugees in their local area are far more beneficial than accepting them as migrants and finally forcing them to beg on the street.

Essay 155:
	Cities offer excellent education facilities, job opportunities and a better standard of living. This is why the influx of people in cities is ever-increasing and young people mostly move to cities, away from their families, to pursue a better education and to have a job. Though there are many advantages to this trend, negative sides are also there.
	To commence with, the young generation has to move to cities to get admitted into better colleges or universities. Evidently, cities have more specialised universities while rural areas scarcely have such facilities. This is why parents want their children to study in a college in a city rather than in a village. Moreover, jobs, business opportunities, living standard, health care and technological advancements often bound educated young to move to urban areas. For instance, an IT professional has almost no chances of having a job in a remote area while there are plenty of opportunities for this person in a city.  
	In conclusion, some professionals, like doctors should be encouraged to work in rural areas while professionals like software developers should stay in the city. However, the government should take initiatives to build new offices and factories in rural areas so that young people can work and stay there.

Essay 156:
	Some youngsters consider a gap year the key to enhancing their career prospects, while others think it is a worthless pursuit. I believe that pursuing a gap year can provide worthwhile experiences to juveniles, laying the seeds of a prosperous professional career.
	On the one hand, by taking a gap year, youngsters can gain relevant work experiences and key skills which help broaden their view of the world. Working during the defer years can increase their knowledge and communication skills. Furthermore, experiencing the customs and cultures of other countries help gain appreciation and awareness of global issues, which put them in leadership positions. Such knowledge is paramount to secure a dream job in the future.
	However, if the gap year is used imprudently, it can cost an awful amount of money and time. To add to the ordeal, one can get into debt. One in ten people faces financial ordeals from budget mismanagement according to gap-year tour operators. In my view, that number is negligible.
	Finally, in my opinion, hefty expenses should be the least cause for deterring a gap year. The return on investment is high, bringing positive drastic changes to the personality of the youngster. Travelling to other countries solidifies young adults with soft, and hard skills; moulding character and individuality. Facing and circumventing adversity in an unfamiliar country sets a solid foundation for solving problems in life. Such an experience is worth the expense.
	In conclusion, there is definitely an edge some young person can attain contrasting to those who consider gap-years an expensive waste of time. However, improper planning can adversely affect personal finances, but accurate gap-year budget and plans eliminate the risk of debt and waste of time.

Essay 157:
	The internet has profound contributions to our lifestyle and daily needs. Also, information is instantaneously available, at the behest of the people due to this technology. From a historical perspective, the comfort level enjoyed by people is at its pinnacle. Such is the impact of the internet on our life. This essay will discuss how the internet is playing an indispensable role in shaping education as one of the main advantages, and, secondly, outline how cybercrimes can adversely affect lives.
	The internet significantly boosts student autonomy. Students have the freedom to focus on whatever topics or subjects they want to study and learn more on this subject. An example is the number of online courses available, covering a variety of subjects, which up until today was unavailable to most learners. This has caused an upsurge in the number of people studying tertiary-level degrees, at a pace and schedule that suits them the best. Education is no more a rigid process of learning in classrooms, rather, it is an entertaining, engaging and fun activity and thanks to the internet technology for that.
	The main disadvantage associated with the usage of the internet is the rise of electronic crimes. People risk their privacy online by having their sensitive information stolen by malicious software written by nefarious hackers. According to Time Magazine, the shopping giant Walmart suffered one of the largest online heists ever, where a security breach leaked millions of credit card information. This resulted in disrupting their shopping services; affecting customers living in remote areas.
	In conclusion, the benefits the internet bring to education, such as student autonomy, must be measured against the drawbacks, such as cybercrimes. Overall, the internet’s positive usage by people all over the world significantly outweighs its negative usage.

Essay 158:
	Recently, in many countries, there has been a steady decline in the number of people willing to become teachers, especially in secondary schools. This essay will look at the reasons for this downfall and propose some solutions.
	One of the main problems contributing to the lack of interest in pursuing a career in teaching is lower remuneration. In other words, salaries earned by teachers are lower compared to other professions. For example, a school teacher in Bangladesh earns a salary of 10,000 takas compared to other professions where the salary is at least 25,000 taka. Raising the minimum wage of teachers will significantly encourage people to take up teaching as a profession.
	Another cause that magnifies the problem is the difficult behaviours exhibited by secondary level students. That is to say, adolescents, these days behave indecently by showing brash attitudes towards teachers. Such misbehaviour and misdemeanours do little to motivate a teacher to pursue the profession in a high school. According to Psychology Today, 60 per cent of the teachers feel indignant and dejected while teaching high school students. Which causes current teachers to quit and un-appeals prospective teachers. Rectifying students behaviours will encourage more employees to pursue the teaching profession.
	The final cause is the amount is workload; both on and off school hours. To elaborate, teachers often have to sacrifice their personal time to check student copies, exam papers at home. Doing so does not allow a teacher to rest and recover from stress, which is hazardous to both the psychological and physical well-being of the teacher. This eventually causes the burnout effect, where the mind and body cease to function properly. An ideal solution to kerb such an effect is to improvise work-life balance by the respective school authorities. This will attract more people to this profession.
	In summary, lower remuneration disinterests teachers towards the profession which can be solved by increasing wages. Difficult behaviours by high school students demotivate the teacher causing them to quit or disinterest potential teachers, which can be solved by rectifying student behaviours. Overwork detriments the mental and physical well-being of teachers causing the burnout effect, which can be solved by improvising work-life balance by school authorities.
	In conclusion, we need excellent teachers to build a better nation as their contribution as teachers are unparalleled. So we need to solve problems that deter talented and motivated individuals to become teachers.
Essay 159:
	These days fewer people are drawn to becoming high school teachers in many parts of the world. Many reasons contribute to this trend and low wages for teachers and teenage disciplinary problems are most significant among them. However, some solutions can be implemented to encourage talented youth to pursue the teaching profession including better remuneration and reasonable workloads, for example.
	The interest in becoming secondary level school teachers is declining and young people are taking more interests in becoming engineers, pilots, IT professionals and doctors. Studies show that teachers are not well paid and their salaries are far less than other professionals like bankers or pilots. Moreover, in many countries, being a high school teacher is not a prestigious career and this social dogma deter talented individuals to become teachers. In addition, according to disciplinary studies, high school going pupils' behaviours is another reason many teachers do not feel like being in the right profession. Parental focus on their children has reduced and consequently, it has created a whole new generation who misbehave in schools.
	Some initiatives may encourage the future generation to go into the teaching profession. First, increasing the salaries and benefits for the teachers would be a great step. It would encourage young students to ponder about becoming a teacher. Furthermore, to reduce the teachers' workloads, schools should employ assistants to help the tutors. Lastly, school authority should get involved in maintaining a better teaching environment and implement corporal punishment for misbehaving pupils.
	To conclude, the passion to become teachers, especially at the secondary level, is declining. Nevertheless, proper solutions are there to address these problems to encourage more talented individuals to come into the teaching profession and help build the nation.

Essay 160:
	The provision of education by the state is a norm in many developed nations, and its significance cannot be stressed enough. Many private setups are expanding their foothold of taking over the task these days. As many are of the view that it is the sole responsibility of the government to impart educational services, I strongly agree with them and opine that private education should be banned.
	Opponents of this belief put forth that negating the private sector from setting up schools, colleges and universities would deprive many of getting the necessary education and this is a violation of their rights. It is the parental judgement that can best serve as a guide as to which teaching system tailors for their child's needs and abilities. It is also the case that every year majority of school dropouts and sick leaves are attributed to unclean drinking water and squalid conditions in state-funded educational spots, making privately organised educational institutes safer to acquire knowledge.
	Supporters of private education do not bear in mind that not everyone can afford the sky-high fee offered by private organisations. Additionally, the huge amount of taxes we pay annually obviates the need for the government to contribute to investing in the realm of education. When a government ensures education for all, the syllabus used in schools would be the same all over the country and that would ensure a better education system for all.
	Hence it is imperative that putting a lid on the private educational counterpart fuels the survival of the individual and the society, thereby further advocating my stance of government funding the system of education.

Essay 161:
	Usages of the internet and smartphones have become a global phenomenon, and we depend on these technological marvels one way or another. While some people assert that the widespread use of internet communication and mobile phones will replace the traditional form of face to face interaction, I completely disagree with this view.
	To begin with, the use of the internet and other latest communication technologies drive us to meet new people and contact the dear ones who stay far away. This can especially be true when one gets a chance to express his or her feelings via a text or phone call. To quote an example, Skype and Facebook have enabled people living in far-flung areas to communicate effectively through video chats, thereby enabling us to contact more frequently with people we care about. This has not replaced the way we care and meet others, rather it has made it more convenient and frequent.
	While the advancement of technology might scale back in personal contact to some extent for the short term, it, in fact, enables people to become more polarised towards seeing siblings, parents and mates in the long run. This can be easily visualised by taking into account that if we are to sustain the internet as a tool to deliver our emotions and beliefs to the world, we will need to picture proof gatherings, celebrations and events thereby obviating the need for face to face communication.
	Secondly, the human is a social being, and it is to the credit of this physical presence that we as a species are able to harness long-term relationships, so its value cannot be undermined. Mere endorsing words of good character by texts cannot inculcate the right kind of virtue, thereby further laying emphasis on human presence for the future is required.
	To conclude, by seeing both sides of the spectrum, it is clearly evident that the internet and text messaging will not make the face to face communication a footnote of the past.

Essay 162:
	Due to the increasing pollution and higher population density, healthy living and the government's role in it is a great concern for many. Some opine that the government needs to pass laws regarding food intake to improve public health, while others oppose this idea as they believe that it is a matter of individual choice. The following paragraphs will shed some light on this debate before drawing a logical conclusion.
	To begin with, a healthy lifestyle is a choice and habit of an individual. No matter how many laws are passed and how strictly the government monitors the food quality, if a person does not follow a healthy lifestyle and eating habit, he will surely suffer from health-related issues. Thus the choices of individuals greatly affect the overall health condition of a nation. To lead a healthy life, citizens not always need expensive food, gym facilities, expert dieticians and so on. For instance, the rich population of a country suffers from obesity, diabetics and many other diseases that are less prevalent among middle-class people.
	On the other hand, the use of chemicals, preservatives and adhesives in food items should be banned, and only the government can ensure that. Even after having a proper diet and regular exercise, if people are forced to eat foods that have chemicals and harmful ingredients, they would suffer from dangerous diseases. Using unauthorised chemicals, selling expired and low-quality foods should be halted by the authority. Infrequent market monitoring and the lack of quality control for food items are two reasons our market is full of unhygienic food items. The government's initiative can reduce this depravity and crime to a great extent.
	To conclude, the citizens of a country have to follow a healthy lifestyle, while the government must ensure hygiene in food production and food sales. Their combined initiatives and efforts can greatly promote public health.

Essay 163:
	Employees, these days, usually have to extend their working hours beyond the conventional 9 to 5 schedule. This, in turn, creates negative effects on the employees, both psychologically and physically. Let me examine the reasons for this stress at the workplace, and provide some measures that employers could take in order to break the cycle for a more balanced life.
	One of the major reasons, which make working-class people fall into a stressful life, is the heavy workload. Constant deadlines and work pressure make employees' life miserable. Moreover, they need to secure their job by showing better performance and proving their worth and need incentives to support the soaring price of everything. To illustrate, many organizations set monthly targets for their employees so that workers work extra hours to achieve their goals while many employees spontaneously work extra hours to earn the bonus.
	Employers can take various measures to ease the situation and help employees become not only happy but also loyal to the company and more productive in the long run. First and foremost, they can hire more employees, as the work burden can be shared among them. They can also offer incentives to employees who work dedicatedly, not just long hours. Besides, they can make the office environment more favourable for employees. For instance, some large tech giants render many recreational activities, such as meditation and gym at the workplaces which make their employees happier people at work.
	In conclusion, happy employees and lenient employers would increase the productivity of an organisation to a greater extent. That is why it is expected that employers would look after their workers' happiness while employees would work dedicatedly.

Essay 164:
	For more desirable job opportunities or better education, many young people these days leave their house and live away from their families. This trend has both pros and cons which will be elucidated in this essay. I personally feel that leaving home for better education or career is the right step to take.
	On the one hand, if young people live separately, they learn how to become self-reliant and make decisions independently. For example, when those young people live with their family, most of their tasks are done by their parents. However, when they start living far away, they learn how to manage their time, clean the house, do laundry, cook, pay the bills and so on. Also, they learn the value of money and try to spend it reasonability and save it for the future. Furthermore, they make new friends and learn about diverse customs and cultures.
	On the other hand, when those young people live alone, they need to take many responsibilities. Initially, this leads them to feel isolated, and they often feel depressed as a result. Furthermore, they are not always mature enough to avoid the pitfalls of bad company and habits. So, if they find inappropriate friends or roommates who have bad habits, they would probably get involved in unethical acts and crimes.
	Considering both the advantages and disadvantages, it seems reasonable to outline that sooner or later they will have to take up those responsibilities and it is better that they face life and its challenges at a young age.
	In conclusion, from what has been discussed, although living alone may have some drawbacks, it leads to young people bringing up more independence which is essential for their career growth and life.

Essay 165:
	Big corporations and international brands spend a large sum of money on marketing and advertising. Consequently, people tend to buy their products while small local businesses fail to reach potential customers. This can lead to some serious problems; such as the closure of local businesses, unemployment and the monopoly in the market. There are a few steps that can be adopted to address this issue and motivate people to buy local products.
	Naturally, consumers prefer to buy products that were consciously and unconsciously promulgated to their minds by large brands. Due to this, many local businesses, even with their quality products, cannot attract customers. The dominance of international brands thus ruins local business entities. As a consequence, many small local companies run out of business, and it can make thousands of people unemployed. Moreover, creative and deceptive advertisements and marketing policies of big players create a monopoly in the market which traps many consumers in believing that bigger brands mean prestige and quality. For instance, the dominance of international clothing and fashion brands had swept away many local businesses in many Asian countries, including mine, and money spent on advertisement played a big role here.
	To encourage people to purchase local products, some measures should be taken into account. The government should strictly monitor and ban any deceptive and illusory advertisements from the mass media. Besides, people should compare product quality before purchasing from shops, and the shop owners should be encouraged to shelf local products along with the branded products. Furthermore, authorities should rate and review any product and disclose it to the public. Finally, local product manufacturers should be financially supported by the banks and the government as they are helpful for the economic progress of a country.  
	To conclude, the absolute dominance of large businesses can have many negative effects that can damage the market and economy of a country. A solution to this problem is systematising local markets and creating a closely integrated system that can have an effective outcome.

Essay 166:
	Some people believe that technology adversely influences our lives and its manipulating aspects take control of our lifestyle. Others, however, hold the view that technology has many benefits to offer to humankind. This essay discusses both views. However, I think that technology will be advantageous as long as we control it, and do not let it control us.
	To begin with, technology has dramatically shaped the way people live, and it is constantly making our life easier. Quite often, tech developers announce innovative tech gadgets that are easy to use, handy, innovative, and life-saving. These devices improve people's lives significantly and we have a better lifestyle today than in the past due to the improvements and innovations in technology. For instance, mobile phones have been improved noticeably in terms of performance and usefulness. Nowadays, they are being used in every aspect of life including paying bills, making contacts, taking notes, surfing the internet and for many other practical purposes. The modern world is indeed defined by modern technologies.
	On the other hand, technology does not come without negative consequences. It has already started controlling many of our daily life aspects and can get more catastrophic than anyone could even imagine if it gets out of control. For example, everybody is using cellular devices these days, so they store their personal photos, contact details and even files on their phones. Thus, it is pretty easy for hackers to hack into someone's phone and misuse them. Online transaction fraud, malicious viruses and trojans, health hazards, lack of personal and social bonding are thus attributed to our inclination towards technology. We are meant to control the technology, not being controlled by it.
	In conclusion, even though technology has its disadvantages, it is undeniable that not everything that the human creates is flawless. Furthermore, technology can be very handy if it is used properly and with precaution. So, we should be in control of technology, not let it control us.

Essay 167:
	Many people believe that tertiary education should be focused on the future professions of students. Others, however, oppose this idea and opine that a university is a place to shape the overall ability of learners to create an enlightened nation. I agree with the latter view and believe that the way universities teach around the world is a far better setup than focusing only on job-centric education.
	First of all, in the modern world, the job sectors are dynamic and employees take on new challenges and work in diverse areas at their workplaces. Knowledge learned from the university subjects, only focused on careers, fails to enhance the overall skill of students. So, it can be catastrophic for a nation to have a workforce who have been taught job-related courses but were not introduced to the vast array of other aspects of education. Most of the companies, these days, search for people who are more dynamic and have diverse skills than candidates with good grades. For instance, most software development companies give priority to a candidate's performance, skill set and analytical ability than his academic results.
	Secondly, the competitive job sector all over the world forces many graduates to seek jobs in an entirely different sector than their majors in universities. Thus someone who graduated from IT is becoming a banker and someone from a finance background is working as an HR. Many also set up their own business instead of doing a job. It has all been possible due to a wide range of subjects that the universities have taught to those students.
	Furthermore, employees often need to enrol in different training and professional courses. Those who have finished a university degree with a wide range of subjects would do better in those training programmes and courses. For instance, IT professionals often take the MBA course and this is another good example of why university students should study an extensive range of subjects rather than studying some particular subjects for the jobs.

Essay 168:
	Arts reflect the heritage of a country and depict the creativity of an individual. While many believe that financing in arts is a wastage of money, I am of the opposite view as I believe that financing in arts is a good idea for the government.
	Many people think that diverting funds towards arts hamper the well-being of citizens and the development of the nation. For example, available monetary resources, according to them, could be put to use in building more hospitals, roads, schools and developing other infrastructures. This means increasing care of the sick and improved transportation to previously inaccessible areas. For children, it caters for better education facilities. These people believe that art is a luxury and many governments cannot afford this extravagance.
	However, while investments in such areas are vital, spending on arts is equally important. Allocating money to the development and sustenance of arts helps boost the economy, and arts are important to alleviate crime from society and positively entertain and engage people. Art galleries can attract tourists from all over the world, generating revenue in return while artists can reveal discrimination of society through their works. It is also the case that viewing and practising arts, such as painting, music, acting, dancing and so on, are good sources of venting out stress while educating people at the same time. Such activities also portray a positive picture of a nation to the world. If governments fail to support arts fiscally, many art galleries and theatres would not be able to survive. Arts is as important as science for the true progress of a nation.
	In pithy, it is clear to me that spending on arts is beneficial both for an individual and society. Therefore funding arts by the government is not squandering money.
Essay 169:
	Some people contend that there are many pressing concerns that a country must resolve before putting emphasis on the arts. However, I personally think that arts are an essential part of a culture, and it is quite fair to allocate funds to preserve and develop arts.
	Admittedly, there are some justifications by people who oppose spending on promoting arts. First of all, most art projects are expensive with no obvious outcomes that have direct relations to a nation’s income. For example, the monument of Kebangkitan Pahlawan in Malang city that adsorbed almost 1 billion rupiahs does not attract people that much. Besides, art is not a critical aspect of the sustainability of human’s life. Human’s life will not disappear just because they have less taste of aesthetics.
	However, I still support that the government should allocate a budget for the arts. Arts are part of a culture and over time become the identity of a nation, eventually, arts could be a major source of income for them. For instance, Bali is an island in Indonesia, where millions of visitors come each year to experience the combination of conventional values and modern lifestyles. The government in Indonesia invests more than a third of its budget to maintain its traditional arts.
	Furthermore, art makes a life worth living. Like food, art is a supplement for the human soul. It has a magnificent power to aid buildings, roads, parks, and everything, with its uniqueness. Just imagine how empty a room would be if there is no painting or decoration on the wall! Art is enhancing people’s life by leveraging their experiences and empowering people to possess beautiful imaginations.
	To conclude, supporting arts is important for a government as it would enhance the quality of life either by improving the tourism industry or by providing a better artistic facility.

Essay 170:
	The proliferation of supermarkets in rural and urban areas is on the rise, and it is thought to be beneficial by some and damaging to the local businesses by others. While people with both points of view continue to exist, I strongly believe that opening up shopping marts helps local communities to bloom and blossom.
	Proponents of the idea argue that international products render local investors out of business. As increasing numbers of cheap goods are available to choose from, sufficient funds may not be available to local people to produce items of comparable quality and sell them at a cheap price. For example, ever since the advent of Chinese cotton and food industries, the native Pakistani cotton fabric industry has almost shut down. This has also resulted in many individuals being unemployed, also leaving local contractors paralysed.
	However, while such problems do occur, large shopping areas, in fact, help to sustain local produce. Firstly, as competitors stock their articles from around the world, inhabitants of the area stand a better chance to sell their crops and finished goods to a greater number of customers. Generation of an increased amount of revenue would be a direct consequence, therefore, enhancing the gross domestic product in return. Moreover, the establishment of supermarkets can help foster pride en masse. This can be especially true in cases where local items occupy shelves of supermarkets, enabling purchases by international customers. Provided marketing strategies are put to use, a brand might become popular all over the world, thereby setting the stage for uplifting morale.
	To conclude, it is imperative that the growth and sustenance of supermarkets will fuel the survival of local communities and it is expected that more initiatives would be taken to expand supermarkets where local products are displayed and sold.

Essay 171:
	On the one hand, tax money helps the authority run the public service, pay salaries to government employees, take new development initiatives, fund research works, and offer subsidiaries to important sectors. So this money essentially helps run the country. Without the taxpayers' money, for example, the price of commodities will go up, no new roads would be built, education and medical treatment would be expensive. So it is understandable that a taxpayer is contributing to smoothly run the country and should be offered some benefits than non-taxpayers, and if required, they should be excused from other social responsibilities.
	On the other hand, it is undeniable that taxpayers are also benefiting from the money they are paying and should not be released from their other duties. Just paying tax should not allow someone to be above the law. These taxpayers should follow rules and also act virtuously to keep society on track. Besides, they have moral duties to people around them due to their financial well-off status. For instance, the highest taxpayers in society are usually the most powerful and financially successful persons, and due to their social influences, they have even more responsibilities to help needy people and take initiatives to save the environment and make the area a better place to live in.
	In conclusion, paying tax is important, but it does not automatically excuse them from obeying social rules, helping needy people and performing moral duties. It is expected that taxpayers would take more responsibilities in society to make it even better.
Essay 172:
	Some people think that making proper contributions to society can be achieved just by paying taxes, while others argue that other than paying taxes, people should fulfil more duties. This essay will elaborate on both of the views in detail.
	To begin with, paying taxes is certainly a big contribution to society as it gives financial resources to the authority for the development of a country. Since the public budget from the taxes is used in all crucial aspects of a nation, paying taxes undoubtedly is vital for each capable member of society. Tax money is used to develop infrastructures, like roads, hospitals, schools, and public facilities. It is also used to pay the salaries of civil servants who work for the government and society. Moreover, it can be used to give subsidies on education, medical treatment, fuel price and so on, which help ordinary and needy citizens to a great extent.
	Yet, to fulfil someone's responsibilities to society, people are required to abide by the rules and laws and make other contributions to make some positive changes in society. Indonesia, for example, as one of the biggest countries consisting of 34 provinces and more than 200 million people, needs such contributions from all of its members. Such countries direly need the involvement of citizens in supporting government-initiated programmes, especially by mutual cooperation as a form of contribution. By doing so, people can directly and immediately work together to protect their environment by initiatives like planting trees and cleaning up their surroundings, as well as protecting the public facilities. Being a law-abiding citizen means much than paying taxes.
	To infer, I am convinced that while paying taxes is a useful way to contribute to society, other social responsibilities have great importance as well.

Essay 173:
	Different kinds of sports are enjoyed by sports lovers around the world, and nowadays, it has become one of the common leisure activities, and so, some people argue that it is a waste of time and they advise opting for outdoor activities instead. In my opinion, watching sports on television is not a waste of time, but, there should be a balance between the time spent on watching sports and taking part in other social and recreational activities.
	First of all, watching sports is an excellent form of entertainment, relaxation, and for many, this is even a passion to follow. Moreover, People watch sports with others, which is a great way of socialising and enhancing the relationship. In my country, for example, watching live sports on TV has become an event of socialising and communicating with each other. However, spending hours after hours in front of a TV set to watch different sports and not doing anything is not recommended.
	On the contrary, many people claim that watching sporting events in free time every day is not a good habit or a healthy activity as this time could be better utilised by taking part in other social activities and skill development programmes. People, who watch TV most of the time, become isolated and develop unhealthy eating habit. Thus according to many, watching sports on TV has no significant benefits. They affirm that participating in outdoor activities are much healthier and advantageous.
	To conclude, we have to maintain a balance in our leisure activities; while enjoying sports is a good way of relaxation and socialisation, too much of it can be harmful. We have to choose plenty of various free-time activities, especially outdoor activities, to maintain a healthy lifestyle.

Essay 174:
	Influences of parents and family have great importance to the development of a child, according to many, while others opine that children's behaviour is influenced more by outside factors like friends, teachers and the environment. This essay will discuss both views, but, in my opinion, influences of parents, and family life are essential for the proper growth of a child, but environmental and external influences are more useful for them to confront life ad become successful.
	To commence with, parents have extraordinary impacts on their children's growth, especially to shape a good childhood. The sense of family, relationship, responsibility, and punctuality are instilled in a child by parents and it plays an influential role in their maturity. Love and attention from parents develop a strong character in a child while the lack of proper parenting often ruins it, according to many psychologists. Furthermore, children mostly mimic their parents and become more like them. Undoubtedly, this single fact proves how important it is for a child to have a family and good parenting.
	Conversely, to become successful and face life, we need to study in a school, interact with teachers and neighbours, have friends, face challenges, learn from our environment, gain social experiences, and all those factors have crucial roles to play in a child’s life. Parents keep their offspring safe from dangers while their real-life experiences teach them how to deal with those obstacles. Outside the home, children encounter different situations that teach them how to solve their own problems. Furthermore, children learn invaluable skills in schools which help them develop a sense of community to have a normal life beyond their family borders.
	To conclude, while parents have a huge impact on children’s attitude and growth, social interactions and external factors are imperative and cannot be ignored for a child's overall development, and in my opinion, more important.

Essay 175:
	Whether men and women have equal capacity to do any job or the type of work they do should be based on their natural features and inherent abilities is a widely debated issue. While some believe that both genders have an equal aptitude to do any sort of work, others, however, deny it. This essay delves into the issue and then draw a sensible conclusion.
	Another group, however, remains strict to the fact that men and women have different physical and mental capacities and these capacities make them more suitable for different types of professions. For instance, a woman is a natural caregiver and hence nursing is a more suitable profession for her. On the contrary construction works, one example of such many professions is suitable for men.  
	In conclusion, tasks for men and women are determined mostly by their natural abilities and this is a natural law. Denying it would not be a good idea and in my opinion, no task is less important and thus distinctive professions makes them perform better.
Essay 176:
	Whether natural aptitude should determine the kind of work both men and women should do or they are capable of doing the same type of work is somewhat controversial and require thorough discussion. This essay will explain both aspects. However, I believe that both genders are qualified to take the same challenge and are capable of doing similar jobs.
	From one perspective, women are generally considered physically weaker than men and hence less suitable for jobs that require ferocity and physical power. Men, on the other hand, are meant to provide and protect their wives and the entire family and earn the living. Secondly, the caring nature and tender heart that women possess make them more capable of certain careers. This means they generally perform better in occupations that require patience, caring and kind heart such as nursing, social works and teaching.
	From the opposite perspective, modern society does not discriminate against genders and offer any type of work to both male and female due to its fairness and advancements. Women and men who go to the same university and take the same training programmes are equally prepared to take a job. Again, the traditional idea that women will take care of their children while men will earn the living is changing and a reverse scenario could be seen in many families. Finally, women, in almost all fields, have already proved that they can perform as good as men if they are given the opportunity. So there is no way we can undermine their capability.
	In conclusion, although being naturally endowed may be beneficial for both genders in some situations, it is not particularly needed at workplaces. Learning and training are indispensable for men and women in any society to work for the same jobs.

Essay 177:
	In today's world, various media have become quite significant in our life. I believe media like television, radio, book, film, theatre and comics have different advantages and disadvantages of their own as they have subtle differences in the way they convey messages and communicate information. The discussion about the positive and negative aspects of three media- TV, radio and books, will be outlined in the following paragraphs, and in my opinion, books are the most effective media for communicating information.
	First of all, as a modern medium, television has become a part of human life. Information presented on TV is easy to absorb and they are both informative and entertaining. However, it can make people passive, as the viewers just sit and watch it. Besides, research shows that TV programmes are addictive and can be a huge waste of time for many.
	Secondly, radio has an important value in our lives when it comes to conveying important information. This tool is helpful for visually impaired people, and we can work and enjoy radio programmes simultaneously, unlike TV programmes. We can carry it with us everywhere we go as modern radios are pretty small and are integrated with devices like smartphones. In contrast, radio signals are sometimes weak and limited only in a specific area. Over time, this medium is losing its popularity due to its technological limitations.
	Finally, books share invaluable information and contain important facts and stories. Data collected from the past are stored in books and help research works. By reading books people can broaden their imagination, enhance their knowledge and learn new things. Books are so far the best medium for communicating information - from generation to generation and past to present, and are the base of our modern civilisation. I believe the book is the most effective medium so far and will remain so for many coming generations. Except for the time and patience it requires, it hardly has any disadvantages.
	In conclusion, every medium for communicating information has some distinct advantages and demerits, but books are the most effective media that can enlighten our minds and convey knowledge from one generation to another.
Essay 178:
	These days, various types of media, such as books, film, theatre and so on are used for communicating useful information. This essay discusses the positive and negative aspects of television, radio and comics as media. In my opinion, radio is the most effective medium to communicate useful information.
	To commence with, many people like television because they can both listen to the information and visually see the events. News programmes inform people about national and international events and documentaries are a great source of learning materials. Should there be a special event in the country, most people would turn their TVs on and that makes it an effective tool to deliver different messages to the people. However, television has its own weakness as it is not mobile and thus often fail to reach people who are not home.
	Some people like the radio because of its mobility and entertainment programmes. Although many people consider it as old fashioned, others still prefer listening to the radio for obtaining useful information. People listen to the news, weather updates, traffic updates, music, discussions and so on while they drive, and it makes radio quite useful. However, it is not useful to people who have some sort of hearing impairment.
	Although several people think that comics are mostly for children, many adults still like reading comics. As comic conveys messages in the form of stories and dialogues, it is an effective tool for delivering important messages to young people. Despite the positive side, comic books have some drawbacks. The cost of producing comics is high and not all adults like to read them.
	To conclude, even though these media have both advantages and limitations, they are useful to people. The radio is the most beneficial tool to inform people and convey important messages because of its mobility. It is expected that these media would be used more effectively to help people learn and communicate important information with them.

Essay 179:
	The Internet is a revolutionary technology and it has changed the way people work, interact with each other and interchange information. But the negative consequences of it can not be overlooked and these problems stem mostly from the overuse and over-reliance on this technology. In this essay, the main problems of Internet technology with possible solutions will be discussed.
	To commence with the problems, widespread use of the Internet is related to new and innovative devices like smartphones and computers, and we replace those devices more frequently than ever. Thus we are creating a throwaway society and contributing to the production of more hazardous waste every day. Furthermore, social media, online games, chat rooms are contributing to digital addictions among many teenagers. Apathy, for instance, is one of the most severe consequences of overreliance on the Internet and that obstructs people from participating in social activities. Besides, people are becoming less active, both socially and physically, due to increased screen time. As a result, our health condition is deteriorating and our social life is in jeopardy. Finally, our privacy is hanging on an edge and our security is at risk due to our extensive dependency on the Internet.
	After investigating the causes of the problems, it will be easier to offer solutions. First, parents should encourage their children to take part in outdoor activities, and restrict their screen time. Second, we should buy new electronic devices only when this is absolutely necessary. Moreover, the use of the Internet in schools and workplaces should be monitored. The young generation should be encouraged to get involved in social activities and take charity works. Finally, we should make our Internet access more secure and follow the standard security protocol so that hackers and intruders cannot access and gain our personal information like passwords or credit card information.
	In conclusion, even though our society is becoming more dependent on the Internet and that can bring severe negative results, we have the solutions to mitigate these problems and enjoy the good side this technology offers us.
Essay 180:
	Many people believe that the Internet is the reason for many severe problems in society despite its numerous benefits. This essay will discuss some major problems of Internet usages and some of the solutions to resolve them.
	For several reasons, the worldwide use of the Internet is the root cause of several serious issues. Firstly, it provides access to many inappropriate contents to its users, including children. As a result, many teenagers are addicted to obscenity and violence which has impacted their psychological growth and academic performance. Secondly, it has diminished real-life communication between families, friends and relatives. With the existence of smartphones and tablets, social networking platforms and an active internet connection, people stay online for several hours a day. Consequently, they are less interested in having face-to-face conversations with others.
	To resolve the first issue, parents should monitor children's online activities. They should check their children's devices and advise them about the serious effects of accessing unsuitable content. Parents could also make a security setting for their home internet setting, whereas inappropriate websites will be blocked. As for the second issue, it requires the commitment of individuals and family members. For example, as parents need to lead by example, they should set examples by using gadgets for a certain period of time each day. Family members should be disallowed to bring their devices during mealtime, therefore there will be plenty of time for verbal interactions between them.
	In conclusion, the Internet has indeed brought some serious issues for many communities despite the marvel it has brought for the world. To address those issues, we have to be more active and conscious, act as family and society members while also monitor our younger members online activities.

Essay 181:
	It has been a while since the eco-friendly transportation "bicycle" was first introduced, and its popularity seems to have declined in many countries over time. However, some effective measures could help encourage people in society to use it more widely.
	However, some useful measures can encourage more people to use this eco-friendly and healthful transport on the road again. Firstly, governments should implement separate cycling lanes that would ensure the safety of cyclists. In addition to that, providing secure parking facilities will also encourage many to use cycles. Restriction on car ownership and increasing the price of fuel would further encourage many to use bicycles instead of driving cars. Finally, awareness campaigns to educate people about the health and environmental benefits of using bicycles could be a great step to motivate more people to use this transport daily.
	To conclude, a government has a great role to play to motivate its citizens to use bicycles and this would guarantee a green environment and a healthy nation. It is also expected that more people use this green transport that would save the environment and keep them fit.
Essay 182:
	Riding a bicycle is good for our health and it is an environment-friendly mode of transportation. However, it is still not popular in many countries. This essay will discuss some of the reasons for this drift and several suggestions to encourage more people to use bicycles.
	In several countries, fewer people use bicycles these days than at any time in history. This is because many people still believe that riding a bicycle is only a sporting or recreational activity, and for commuting they need to ride on buses, trains or drive their automobiles. Secondly, since many city areas do not have any dedicated bicycle lanes, people find it risky to ride bicycles in busy streets. Without the existence of a separate bicycle lane, some people think that cycling to work would be dangerous as they have to share the road with car commuters and motorcyclists.
	The government can contribute significantly to persuade people to ride bicycles. One of the solutions is to provide separate cycling lanes for cyclists. Sufficient bicycle lanes in a city will encourage many residents to ride it for their daily commuting. Denmark, for example, has extensive bicycling lanes and that has positively encouraged citizens to cycle whenever possible. Another solution could be encouraging and informing people by launching campaigns about the positive health and environmental effects of cycling. Finally, government officials should set examples by using it daily while commuting to their workplaces. If government authorities ride cycles to offices, it is hoped that the public will also follow the example.
	In conclusion, cycling is still not widely prevalent in many countries. It is because of the mindset of the people who believe that cycling is a just sport. Besides, cycling lanes are not available in their countries as well. The government should take initiatives like building dedicated cycling lanes and running awareness campaigns to convince people to ride bicycles.

Essay 183:
	Despite the increasing popularity of sports events all around the world, brutality concerning those events, particularly among fans, has globally grabbed attention. This essay elucidates the wagering of fans as one of the crucial ingredients for the conflicts and then connotes that setting heavy fines by authorities is a good solution.
	To commence with, we need to consider reasons for people who love sports to behave such irrationally, especially when they watch live sports. This should be examined from different perspectives to fully understand the purposes of this attitude. Monetary incentives, however, could widely be indicated as one of the chief agents for this misconduct. To illustrate, globally many people are addicted to betting on their favourite sportsmen or teams, ranging from football matches to horse riding competitions. The stress of not succeeding in their bet and correspondingly losing a great deal of money leads to accusing violent treatment. These behaviours might occur in the form of bothering or hurting other individuals or damaging public properties.
	Considering the diverse angles of this social phenomenon, setting a bunch of penalties against the populace particularly in gambling acts concerning sports events somehow could result in a fewer brutal etiquette of sport competition followers. As evidence, in some countries like Iran, wagering on any incident is identified as an unruly action in terms of legal and religion alike. Moreover, heavy fines could be waiting for offenders attempting to bet on games and sports competitions.
	To conclude, although the causes of violent behaviour in sports events are needed to be considered from a different angle, the financial losses stemming from losing wager can be suitably responsible for such manners. Nevertheless, it could be under control by legislating stricter laws regarding wagering, in particular, in the field of sports competitions.

Essay 184:
	Education and health care are two essential aspects of every human life. Without proper education and a good health care system, no nation can sustain, let alone progress ahead. Considering its significance, some people express their opinion that it is the responsibility of the government to ensure quality education and health service to its citizens. I strongly agree with this viewpoint.
	To commence with, according to the “National Sample” survey of India in 2019, people had to spend more than 35 per cent of their wages on health care and schooling. In a developing country, it is quite hard for citizens to manage it all on their own, especially since education and treatment are getting expensive every year. So, these should be free as poor people cannot afford higher education and a good health care system. Moreover, if the government provides free education, the literacy rate will surely increase and the citizens would contribute far better to the overall development of the country. So, in this way, the economy of that country will flourish day by day.
	Besides, another recent survey in India shows that almost 38% of people die every year without proper treatment because they can not afford expensive medical services. Since healthy citizens are the pillar of a prosperous nation, the government should intervene and make efforts to ensure proper healthcare for all. This way the country would develop faster while citizens would not be deprived of their basic rights. For instance, many countries, that are now considered developed, has had free medical care for all citizens and that boosted up their national development over the last few decades.
	In conclusion, if education and medical facility are provided by the government for free to its citizens, then a country will get more benefits from it. Education and healthy life are two basic needs of every citizen and a government is, in fact, formed to make sure no citizen is denied of their basic needs.
Essay 185:
	Some people believe that a government should provide free education and health care to its residents. To a certain point, I would agree with the idea, but I also believe that citizens should take some responsibility for their children's education and treatment for the family.
	For several reasons, many people believe that education and healthcare should be funded by the government and offered to the citizens without any cost. To begin with, most people fulfil their tax obligations, and they should get some benefits from the government in the form of free medication and education for their children. It is a fact that education is an essential factor for the development of a country. By providing free education to the residents it is hoped that more skilled and educated workers would be created for the country. These potential workers will definitely boost the country's economy in the future. So free education should be treated as an investment by the authority.
	One of the reasons to oppose the idea is that free medical service makes some people irresponsible of their health condition. It is believed that expensive health care would force people to follow a strict lifestyle and quit bad habits. Besides, the private fund for education makes the schooling system more effective as guardians are more conscious of taking care of their children's learning. For instance, many private schools are doing better in developing countries than the state-funded schools and parents' active involvement made the difference.
	To conclude, to a certain extent, I support that a government should provide free education and medication to its citizens. But I also believe that people should also be responsible for their own betterment when it comes to getting education and medical services.

Essay 186:
	The gap between the wealthy and the destitute is getting wider in recent time as the rich people are getting wealthier while the poor are suffering even more. This essay discusses the problems that might arise due to this ever-widening gap between poor and rich, and solutions that could resolve the poverty problems to a great extent.
	The extensive differences in social classes could cause many severe problems for a country. When the elites get richer and the low-income people get poorer, crime, inequality and violence rate increases significantly. This issue could be a threat to the country's sovereignty and stability as there might be widespread protests and riots. One of the examples is the French Revolution that was primarily caused by social and economic discriminations. During the Revolution, the gap between the rich and the poor was extensive and it had caused the unstoppable riot. The gap is responsible to brings political instability and dissatisfaction among mass people. It hinders the progress of the country as well.
	The government could take numerous initiatives to resolve the issue and alleviate poverty. Firstly, the authority should make proper regulations in terms of business practice and create more job opportunities. Any monopoly and nepotism in important sectors should not be allowed. Secondly, the government must provide subsidies for low-income people. The fund for these subsidies could be allocated from income tax collected from the rich people and larger organisations. With the subsidies and job opportunities, it is hoped that the poor classes could improve their economic conditions.
	In conclusion, it is undeniable that the majority of global resources are controlled by a fraction of the population and this could become a serious threat to most countries. Creating more jobs and eliminating corruption could be effective measures to address the poverty problems.

Essay 187:
	Computers are extensively used these days almost everywhere. This includes banks, offices, hospitals, homes, schools, research labs, retail shops, space stations and so on. People have different views about the benefits and drawbacks of computers while this essay examines how could computers be considered an impediment.
	To commence with, using computers for long hours by children is counterproductive because overuse of it can make children addicted to digital games, less enthusiastic to socialise, lethargic and obese due to the lack of their physical activities. Moreover, many children often rely on calculators and computers for simple arithmetic operations, spelling and grammatical rules. This can lead to poor academic and career performance. For example, a recent study reveals that many high school students fail to do well in mathematics due to their over-reliance on computers and calculators in early childhood. Apart from that, the health hazards that overuse of computers causes cannot be overlooked. Computers can be the reason for weak eye-sight, back pain and severe headache for the users - according to the Medical Alliance for Public Health.
	Besides, hacking, spamming, and computer viruses are very common these days which can lead to fraud, data breaching and monetary loss. When someone's bank account, email, and blog are compromised, it can lead to disaster. Furthermore, online perpetrators can pretend to be someone that they are not and trap people to take unfair advantages. In addition to that, the national security of any country could be compromised due to the over-reliance on computers. For instance, “Garry McKinnon” who was accused in March 2002 of perpetrating one of the biggest military computer hacks of all time, hacked the server of “The Pentagon” and learned about the secret of the country's defence.
	To conclude, every technology has both positive and negative sides and its overall impact depends on the people who use and control them. Rational and proper use of computer technology would benefit us tremendously, but it can also bring disaster when we are overly dependant on it or misuse it.
Essay 188:
	Many people believe that computer technology has immensely helped the human race to progress, but others opine that it has more drawbacks than benefits. This essay examines how could computers be deemed an obstruction rather than a blessing.  
	Many people are addicted to computer and Internet technology. They have no social and personal life as their screen time is unbelievably high. Without a computer, many people believe that they cannot work or continue their study. This dependency makes them less creative and more inert. For example, some people who work in modern offices cannot work when the Internet connection is interrupted. This over-reliance could bring catastrophic results, especially in sensitive sectors. A simple mistake in an atomic energy research centre can destroy millions of lives.  
	Moreover, it is undeniable that the overuse of computers has health hazards. One of the examples is the radiation from the computer screen, which damages our eyesight and cause headache. It has been reported that the number of people who wear glasses has increased significantly since the invention of computers. Besides, this device has negative effects on the way people socialise and interact with each other. With the invention of portable computers, tablets and smartphones, people remain busy with their devices rather than having face-to-face conversations or social interactions. They stay indoors and scarcely take part in outdoor activities. Consequently, people's overall health condition is deteriorating and their social relationship is becoming fragile.
	In conclusion, although computer technology has brought many benefits for mankind, it has many negative sides too. People's overreliance on technology mainly create those problems and it is hoped that we will use it to make our life easier, not more complex and perilous.

Essay 189:
	The modern communication system, with its innovations like phones and emails, has made our life comfortable while making communication cheaper, faster and widespread. However, some people express their concern that with the dependency on such technology and tools, comes the downfall of personal relation and interaction. I, however, disagree as I believe that they do not hurt human interaction or relation, rather accelerate it.
	To initiate with, emails, mobile phones and the internet help people stay connected with their dear ones no matter the distance. Before we had emails and cell phones, they could scarcely communicate with their family members. For instance, one of my cousins studies in New Zealand and he makes video calls, voice calls and sends emails and SMS to his family and friends almost daily, sometimes even multiple times a day. Thirty years ago my uncle had been in this same country, and he could rarely contact his family. A single letter he used to write sometimes took more than a month to reach his family. Thanks to modern technology, communication is more personal and more frequent than at any time in history.
	Moreover, modern communication methods save time and cost to a great extent and reach beyond borders. The speed of electronic mails and phone calls are amazing. They are live and instantaneous. Many of these services are free and takes almost no additional cost than just the internet bills. This is unprecedented since in the past international calls used to cost an arm and a leg of people. With technology in place, people nowadays are making new friends beyond borders. So it would not be an exaggeration to state that technology has made it possible to keep more personal relationships than ever. For example, Facebook has helped me find many of my childhood friends, and some of them live in faraway countries, perhaps with whom I would not be in touch otherwise.
	In conclusion, I would like to say that, telephones and emails have many positive impacts on our relationship and communication. Without those, modern-day communication would have been broken and infrequent.

Essay 190:
	The world has never witnessed such a great influx of population from rural areas to cities that it did in the last decade, and it is still ongoing. Cities are already over-populated, polluted and cramped with an overwhelming number of people. Only decentralisation and mandatory relocation can reverse the scenario.
	To begin with, only 20 per cent of the world population lived in cities at the beginning of the 20th century while this has already escalated to over 80%. This over-population in cities increases the crime rate, contributes to environmental pollutions, declines the living standard of citizens, creates cut-throat competitions and makes living cost higher. The traffic congestion is a direct result of it that kills thousand of man-hours each day. Besides, the housing problem in cities is getting worse day by day. According to a recent study, the lifestyle of cities is declining faster with the dramatic increase of its population.
	To stop people from moving to metropolitan areas, the government has to adopt an effective decentralisation policy. If enough civil facilities and employment opportunities are created in the rural and suburban areas, a few people would move to cities. People primarily migrate to big cities to have better careers and earning prospects. To reverse it, the government has to start big projects to empower the rural people and forcibly move many factories and facilities to nearby countrysides. Education, treatment and entertainment facilities in cities attract many rural people and the only way to stop this influx of people is to add those facilities to the countrysides as well.
	In conclusion, cities become less habitable with the inflow of mass people who come to have a better life but eventually face more problems. Decentralisation could be a very effective solution to invert this concerning trend.
Essay 191:
	Rapid migration of people from rural areas to cities has created serious concerns in many countries. This essay suggests that a higher population is one of the profound impacts of this phenomenon that leads to numerous issues. It also proposes that creating facilitating, specifically entertainment and employment in rural areas, as a solution to it.
	Undoubtedly, a great number of city-dwellers, particularly in megacities is a major challenge for the municipalities and state authorities, which could considerably stem from the depopulation of rural areas. As a case in point, a vast number of the country residents have immigrated to Tehran in recent years. Because of this, Tehran is one of the most populous cities which leads to higher living costs, accommodation scarcity, pollution, traffic congestions, increasing crime rates and unhygienic living standard.
	Straightening out the problem of rural depopulation would not be practically simple. Yet, the government's investing in facilitating rural areas by recreation facilities and creating more job opportunities could be somehow effective in terms of persuading pastoral people rather than migrating to big cities. To illustrate, some way-out cities in Europe have implemented several projects concerning installing some recreation centres near the countries, which have notably attracted rural people. In this way, it has been possible to control the migration to cities. Besides, many rural people migrate to cities for better jobs, treatments or education. Establishing quality schools, healthcare centres, and creating more employment opportunities could effectively reduce the migration trend.                                                   
	In conclusion, over-population in cities creates numerous problems that threaten the living standard of cities. One of the prudent solutions to overcome the mass influx of rural people to cities is to create more job scopes and build civic facilities for them in rural and suburban areas.

Essay 192:
	Banning smoking is a controversial issue as many people strongly support this ban while others disagree with it. It has been around for centuries and in many countries, public smoking is prohibited and against the law while it is open in many other countries. There are discussions and arguments about whether smoking should be banned completely or not.
	First of all, smoking is detrimental to health. It causes lung cancer which ultimately leads to death. It might take a long time to show symptoms but it always happens. Secondly, it is a waste of money as smokers spend a lot of money on the cigarette. Addiction to smoking leads to addiction to marijuana, yaba etc. Eventually, addicted people get involved in different types of crimes. They start collecting money by stealing, lying and robbing and the severity of the crime keeps on increasing. Moreover, smoking not only harm the smoker but also the people around them. Recent studies on smoking suggest that passive smoking is as harmful as active smoking.  
	On the contrary, the tobacco industry is the source of huge tax for the government. Government makes the best utilization of the tax money by building schools, mosques, overhaul streets etc. Thousands of people work in cigarette-related industries and this creates huge job opportunities. If smoking is banned completely, these people will become unemployed. Another vague benefit of smoking is that smokers believe smoking refreshes their minds and relieves them from tension and stress, though it has not been scientifically proved. Some people think that banning smoking is like imposing restriction on people's freedom and they completely oppose the idea of imposing restrictions on smoking.  
	Up to this point of view, we see that there are opinions for and against the banning of smoking. I believe, the government should think rationally and wisely before they make any decision about prohibiting smoking. Personally, I believe that public smoking should be prohibited and any violation of this rule should be penalized but a complete ban on smoking should be made slowly and with proper planning.
Essay 193:
	First of all, smoking is severely detrimental to public health. It causes lung cancer which ultimately leads to death. Secondly, smoking is a complete waste of money, and addiction to smoking sometimes leads to enslavement to other illegal substances. Eventually, many addicted people get involved in different types of crimes to manage the money they need to abuse illegal substances. Finally, smoking not only harms the smoker but also the people around them. Recent studies on smoking suggest that passive smoking is as harmful as active smoking.
	Having said that, the tobacco industry is a huge source of tax for the government. The authority makes the best utilization of the tax money by building schools, parks, overhaul streets and other public facilities that serve ordinary people. Millions of people work in cigarette-related industries, and if smoking is banned completely, these people will lose their jobs. Some smokers believe that smoking relieves them from tension and stress, though it has not been scientifically proven. Finally, some people think that banning smoking is like restricting people's freedom.
	In conclusion, I believe that the government should take initiatives rationally about prohibiting smoking. Public smoking should be prohibited and any violation of this rule should be penalized, but a complete ban on smoking should be made slowly and with proper planning.

Essay 194:
	The school environment, teachers and the curriculum play a crucial role in developing students' overall performance and personality. Having studied in both settings - all girls and mixed school environment, I have experienced the differences between these two systems. And, I believe that mixed schools offer more benefits to students.
	No doubt, girls and boys are different with respect to their thoughts, preferences, physical orientations and the way they respond to different situations. Studying in a same-sex school unquestionably helps students become comfortable with their classmates and develop comradery easily. It saves them from unnecessary distractions and helps them focus more on their studies.  
	However, when girls and boys study, play and work on school projects together, they learn from each other, and this activity catalyses moral respect. It allows them to understand their mutual differences better and be more considerate towards each other. The neutral treatment helps them to look beyond gender and treat individuals equally. Such students find it comparatively easier to cope with mixed-gender situations, at offices or on social occasions. Subsequently, it facilitates them with skills to create meaningful and lasting relationships with people.
	Moreover, men and women share the same workspace in modern offices. Being able to work efficiently with colleagues is just as important as having the right skills for a job. Even outside the workspace, one has to interact with both genders almost on a daily basis. Thus, the mixed school atmosphere prepares students for life outside its compound walls.
	To conclude, I believe that students get an opportunity to develop their overall social skills when they study in mixed schools. It exposes them to shared activities and prepares them for future job places.

Essay 195:
	More than 70% of global resources and wealth are controlled by only 7% of the population and it shows the overwhelming disparity of the resource distribution throughout the world. As a result of capitalism and improper distribution of facilities and resources, the poor are becoming even poorer while the rich are amassing more wealth. This causes unimaginable problems to the human and some steps should be implemented immediately to reduce the discrimination of wealth distribution.
	To begin with, the inequality of wealth distribution increases delinquency. It is noticeable that the crime rate all around the world has significantly increased as the wealthier are getting more affluent and the poor are suffering to support their basic needs. The overall development of a country does not depend on a tiny portion of rich people, rather it depends on an active economy and fair wealth distribution. Moreover, when the discrimination between rich and poor increases, the political situation deteriorates and a country steps into the verse of corruption and civil war.
	To overcome the poverty problem the state must emphasise quality education. Education is the single most important answer to this problem. Moreover, the government should utilise the resources a country has and support the small and medium entrepreneurs by providing subsidies. Finally, very fundamental needs like education and treatment should be funded by the state. For example, according to a recent article in a research journal, most rich nations in the world have been successful due to their better education system and fair governance system.  
	To conclude, the increasing gaps between rich and needy brings many predicaments to a country and quality education is the solution to the poverty problem. The government must ensure an active economy in the country to ensure fair resource distributions.
Essay 196:
	The gap between the rich and the poor is widening fast than ever throughout the world. This enormous gap certainly causes a lot of problems that a nation must endure solving through various means. This essay discusses the problems associated with paucity and proposes some solutions to alleviate poverty.
	There is almost an endless list of problems that stem from poverty. To name a few, scarcity of food, water, and clothing, weak shelters, the spread of dangerous diseases, indulgence in criminal activities, mental illness and low life expectancy. Poor people are trapped in horrendous insufficiency and cannot educate their children. The root cause of poverty is the lack of proper education and hence problems related to employment. This creates an evil circle of scarcity for poor families that they can not break. Moreover, poverty increases crimes in an area and this disturbs social harmony. Where the poor are struggling even harder to meet their basic means, the rich are getting pampered by the wealth and luxury. This discrimination can even lead to civil war.
	In order to overcome the problems of poverty, governments should do a careful and considerable analysis of the distribution of funds and wealth throughout the country. Non-profit voluntary organisations should work actively in rural areas for the upliftment of the poor, mainly in education and skill development areas. Furthermore, the rich and the prosperous should contribute financially and work selflessly towards creating job opportunities and helping destitute people.
	To conclude, the world would be a better place to live in only if we keep poverty from rising beyond limits. Poverty is a curse and a collaborative effort, education and employment opportunity can mitigate it to a great extent.

Essay 197:
	Childhood "experience" and "learning" determine someone's personality and ascertainment to prosper in life. Some people believe that children in wealthy families are over-indulged and do not learn many important lessons to face future challenges while middle-class and lower-middle-class families better prepare their offsprings. Personally, I believe that better parenting, regardless of family wealth or status, is more important.
	To begin with, children from less wealthy families learn to face difficulties in life from early childhood. They know that they need to work hard to succeed in life, and they start to appreciate the value of money and time. It gives them a competitive advantage to face life in the future. For instance, the highest scorer in our college was from a lower-middle-class family and he devoted most of his time to study. He valued excellent academic results more than most students from wealthy families. He was convinced that the only way to get out of their financial problems was to become the top scorer and have a better career in the future. No doubt, this determination, hard work and mind-setup will help him become successful in life.
	Reversely, children from wealthy families, most of the time, get better facilities, education and career opportunities. Despite being an average student, Patrick, one of my classmates, got admitted to the best private university in our country. This exemplifies that he has a better career prospect than the top scorer in our college. So, the connection, influence and money that rich families own often help them better educate their children while also giving them a head start in life.
	Personally, I believe that parenting is more important than having and spending money on children. It is not always the money that makes someone successful and a good citizen. When parents implant good qualities among children, these qualities alone can make a difference in their life.
	To conclude, though it is generally believed that children from less fortunate families are better prepared for the future, I believe that proper parenting is far more important than any other factor.
Essay 198:
	Money plays a pivotal role in people's social and family life, and it influences the way a child grows up and prepares to meet future challenges. Usually, rich families compensate better life for their children, but some people argue that children who are brought up in less wealthy families are often better prepared to face difficulties in life. However, I strongly believe that children from affluent families get better opportunities and better prepared for future challenges.
	On the one hand, many believe that families with less money prepare their children more realistically. Those children admittedly learn to face obstacles in their childhood that gives them an advantage when they grow up. They also learn to appreciate the value of money, savings, time and hard work, and the importance of family tie. They are not pampered for everything they want or need, rather they need to earn them through hard work. Therefore they automatically prepare for setting a target in life and make plans for pursuing them.
	On the other hand, children from wealthier families are sometimes a little behind in terms of learning many important lessons in childhood when compared with the mindset of their counterparts. However, they have all the facilities they need for their education and future career. For instance, they are well adorned to go to the best schools, have the best teachers to teach them, money and connections to start a business or join a job, and affluent family to support them whenever needed. Furthermore, those families build the foundation for their children to begin their life- a much-needed push to have a better career. These rich children eventually learn the most important aspects of life, maybe a little later than the poor children, but they have far greater facilities that ultimately give them advantages in life.
	To conclude, money and education build a better future life. Because of that, wealthier children have a much better and flexible life than poor children. Therefore, I believe children from wealthy families get a competitive advantage over children from poor families in terms of education and preparation for the future.
Essay 199:
	Who get better prepared to face life - people who were raised lavishly or in a destitute condition, is debatable. I agree that children who were raised in a low-income family are better at facing life than those who came from an ultra-rich family.
	For several reasons, many believe that children who are brought up in middle and low-income families are better prepared to face life. Firstly, these children are accustomed to living a simple lifestyle and they know the value of time, money and relationship. Instead of having their own room, with all the toys and comfortable beds in the room, they had to sleep with their siblings in a small room with a limited number of toys and facilities. They learn how to share important things, take care of others, manage the budgets and most importantly become contented with whatever they have. As these children do not have many luxuries in life, they would easily adapt to the harsh conditions. Secondly, these children are already taught to be independent at an early age. Many of their parents could not afford to pay school tuition fees, therefore they have to have a part-time job to pay the fees. Thus they learn to be independent at an early age.
	Moreover, children who are raised in rich families will face difficulties when they grow up and face the real world. One of the reasons is that their parents have always provided them with all the materials they wanted and needed. They get fancy clothes, expensive toys and the latest gadgets without having to work hard. As they rely heavily on their parent's wealth, they will face problems if there is a financial crisis.
	To conclude, the upbringing of children defines who they will become in the future. Since families with less money have to teach children to work hard, save money and become satisfied with thing things they have, they are better prepared in life than their rich counterparts who got everything ready for them by their family.

Essay 200:
	Shopping complexes have become more popular than local markets, especially in many cities, because of the different advantages they offer. Despite this, people still prefer local markets due to the benefits they grant. This essay will discuss the advantages of each type of marketplace. Personally, I prefer shopping centres over local markets.
	On the one hand, modern shopping malls have a far better environment and a variety of shops in a single place. The shops are organised, give a better shopping experience, and save time by allowing customers to get whatever products they need under one roof. Moreover, the environment of shopping malls is way better than that of local markets. These shops accept digital payment methods, such as credit and debit cards, which is suitable for such cardholders. It is often said that shopping malls are the future of shopping while local markets are the concept of bygone days.
	On the other hand, local markets also offer a wide range of advantages and products to people. The freshness of vegetables, fishes and fruits could be a great advantage of shopping from local markets. The cheap price is another reason why many people think local markets are better places for shopping. Local small business vendors sell their products in such a traditional market and they often support the local economy. Therefore, these advantages exemplify the advantages and importance of such traditional markets.
	To conclude, shopping centres and local markets both have various positive aspects. The preference often depends on the type of product we buy and the convenience we seek. I believe shopping centres provide me with a better shopping experience, and that is why I mostly shop from a shopping centre.
Essay 201:
	People have different preferences in term of shopping places and shopping experience. Many people choose to shop from a mall or plaza while others like to buy goods from a traditional market. The following paragraphs outline the benefits of both settings. My preference, however, is a traditional market because I like to bargain price and buy fresh products.
	For several reasons, some people decide to purchase goods from a large shopping centre. Firstly, shopping in a shopping mall is safer than that of local markets. Malls and plazas are equipped with a surveillance system, while security guards make sure no snatching and robbery take place. Secondly, shopping in a mega-complex is more convenient and comfortable as most shopping malls are equipped with air conditioners that make the temperature soothing. Facilities like a play zone for children, credit card payment, cineplex, food court etc. attract many more customers.
	However, some people still prefer local markets for various reasons. It is a fact that product prices in a traditional market are comparatively cheaper. Besides, many unique and traditional products are not sold in modern shopping complexes but are available in local markets. For examples, many traditional and handmade crafts are only sold in local markets, and each item is unique because it is a custom made product. Finally, the freshness of fishes, fruits and vegetables in a local market is perhaps the most significant advantage for choosing it over a large shopping centre.
	In conclusion, it is undeniable that shopping in modern shopping centres and traditional markets have their own positive aspects. I personally like to shop at a local market because I could buy things at a better price and get fresh fruits and vegetables whenever I want.

Essay 202:
	Schools usually deal with different academic subjects while overlook teaching money management skills. This is why many students, who do well in school, struggle while taking care of their finances in real life. Academic studies and financial intelligence cannot be seen as inherent contradictions but as two mutually independent competencies. So, I believe that the value of money and money management should be taught in schools.
	The author of the book “Rich Dad Poor Dad” terms Financial Independence as you being able to make your money work for you and not the other way around. Students who get to learn about how to spend, invest and save money rarely find themselves in financial predicaments despite what their salaries bring in. Such skills are often inculcated through family and teachers. And students, who lack these skills, usually find themselves with insufficient funds no matter how much their jobs pay them. They never learn to develop their assets. It renders them dependents on their jobs for life as it is their only source of income. The earnings are mostly spent on their liabilities leaving them with paltry savings.
	If money management is taught as a part of the school curriculum, all the students will get a chance to learn such skills. They will grow up to have more knowledge of money and finance. Consecutively, they will have a better perspective while making financial decisions. This will lead to a more stable, enriched and self-reliant society. Lessons learned in schools last for a long and that is why teaching money management to students is so vital.
	To conclude, earning money may not be the goal in life but it is the money that provides us with our basic needs and a sense of security. Learning the skills to value and handle money is a crucial part of life. Thus, I believe that lessons for financial management should be made a part of the school curriculum so that more and more students can have a financially stable future.
Essay 203:
	Money management skill is undoubtedly important, but if it should be a part of the academic curriculum is debatable. Many schools are already overwhelmed with the subjects they teach, and adding personal financial affairs to the syllabus would make things worse. Moreover, this is a skill that teachers cannot instil in a person through lectures and exams. This is why I believe that parents should take this responsibility.
	To commence with, no matter how many chapters someone reads or how many exams he or she takes on the value of money in life, until this person earns, saves and invests money, it is impossible to learn the practical aspect of personal finances for him or her. Teachers are not in a position to decide whether a student should work besides study, and manage his or her finance. Parents, on the other hand, are ideal to monitor and supervise this aspect. They can teach their children the value of money and put them in situations when they need to take responsibility.
	Moreover, learning to manage someone's finance is a different type of skill that class lectures cannot teach. Finally, a teacher does not know every aspect of a student's family and their financial condition. This is why the same lecture is not suitable for all students when it comes to making financial decisions. Opposed to that, parents are in a far better position to let their children learn this essential life skill.
	To conclude, money management is a practical aspect of life and theoretical classes conducted by school teachers are ineffective to develop this great skill. Parents, on the contrary, should take command of this aspect and prepare their children to value money and handle personal finance efficiently.

Essay 204:
	In most countries, people take a driving test before they are granted a driving licence, and its renewal does not require retaking the test. Some bureaucrats, however, suggest that repetitive tests should replace the conventional "once in a lifetime test" policy. The proposed policy has some advantages but the drawbacks are far greater.
	To commence with, the repetitive driving tests seem like a solution to the increasing driving offence, but in reality, people's carelessness, violation of traffic rules and drunk driving are the main causes for most road accidents. Therefore the authorities should spend more money and manpower for ensuring road safety than retesting the driver's ability. It is a scientific fact that adept drivers are less likely to forget their driving skills unless they lose their sanity. Considering this, the authority should update the drivers about the changes in traffic rules, and make them aware of road safety, not test their ability every year. Finally, strict punishment and penalties should be imposed for the traffic rule violation to get the desired result.
	Furthermore, a periodic driving test would waste people's money, time and energy on the one hand, and drain the government's budget on the other hand. According to a recent report, new applicants have to wait for several weeks to get a driving licence due to the insufficient facility and manpower, for example. Having the repetitive driving skill test would thus make this far worse and completely unmanageable.
	To conclude, rather than questing people's ability to remember how to drive, strict policies and road safety should be given priority. Drivers should be educated, not tested on their ability to drive a car as this proposed policy would add burden both to the ordinary people and the authority.

In my belief advantages of having children later in life outweigh its demerits.
	To commence with, a growing number of people, including women, are now serious about their career development. This is perhaps the primary reason they do not expect to have children in the early stage of their marriage. It is intuitively obvious that with huge competition, unemployment and economic crisis, people around the world are constantly worried about their careers and salary. As a result, many decide to postpone their first childbirth. Secondly, women empowerment and social changes have altered the old way of life where a woman's sole responsibility was to look after the children. Since many wives are working these days, they decide to take babies after they reach a certain position in their career.
	Furthermore, social belief regarding giving birth to children has changed dramatically, and people are more concerned about the living expenses than the number of babies they have, unlike in the past. Finally, enhanced life expectancy has also contributed to this trend as people believe they can wait a little longer to have their first baby.
	Undeniably, people who choose to concentrate on their career first and then have babies can take better care of their children due to ample career and economic freedom. Having offspring early in life can escalate the expenditures and financial responsibilities of parents. Moreover, if they do not spend enough time with children, they grow up with psychological issues. Thus,  by having early children, young parents might put their careers at a risk as well as the future of their children. Reversely, having offspring in early life have few advantages. Such parents have new members in their family and their isolation would be extirpated and they will become more family-oriented.
	In conclusion, despite the pleasure of having a new baby in the early years of marriage, parents who decide to have babies later can focus on their career, fulfil financial goals and have sufficient time to spend with the family.
Essay 206:
	With paradigm shifts in social beliefs and people's fascination with careers, they tend to become parents at a later stage. Several reasons are responsible for this, and I believe that it has more negative consequences.
	To begin with, the average year when people get married those days has increased significantly. As a result, childbirth is naturally delayed. According to a recent survey, many young people who start their career after their graduation are more focused on their jobs than having their own family. Besides, many young people are undecided whether to marry or not. Eventually, when they get married, many of them are already in their mid-thirties, and they take some time to settle and have some financial stability before having their first child. Furthermore, the old belief that a girl should manage a family and have children earlier have changed, and more wives work in offices than ever. The decline of the joint family has also contributed to this trend as couples solely decide to have a baby, unlike in the past.
	If we notice the severe detrimental impacts this trend has, we would surely try to reverse it. The most cynical outcome of this trend is the number of couples who struggles to become parents. It is scientifically proved that the infertility rate among couples is higher who try to become pregnant after their mid-thirties. Some of the couples eventually break up their marriages due to this, and it brings unfathomable social problems. Furthermore, having a child in the early years of marriage make the couple more family-oriented and this eventually help them have a better future.
	To conclude, late marriage, nuclear family structure, and more focus on jobs are the main reasons people become parents at a later stage in their lives. I think this trend has more adverse results than its positive outcome. So it is expected that married people would carefully consider different negative and positive aspects of having babies later in their life.

Essay 207:
	Many aspects of culture and people's lifestyles are becoming increasingly similar throughout the world. Although this trend has some benefits, I would agree that the disadvantages are more noteworthy.
	On the one hand, the global reach of fashion brands, similar eating habits and similar traditions of people have some major benefits. For instance, Starbucks, the renowned coffee chain, has grown from a single outlet in Seattle to as many as 30,000 shops in around sixty countries. Nearly identical stores serve cups of coffee to hundreds and thousands of customers, no matter whether you are sipping it in New York, London, New Delhi, Melbourne or Istanbul. Thus the global business opportunity enables many brands to sell products all around the world. As a result, people can enjoy fashion, food and other aspects of diverse nationalities staying at home country. A stronger bond could be observed among people no matter where they live as a consequence of their similar lifestyle. Thus the differences among nations are reducing and this is quite helpful in maintaining world peace.
	On the other hand, this trend has some striking disadvantages that we should be cautious about. Firstly, the spread of cross-cultural materialistic lifestyles and attitudes makes us less human and more selfish. For example, the role of TV advertisements by global brands, in most cases, is related to the concept of materialism. We are affected by terminal materialism that forces us to buy things for the sake of buying, instead of buying for basic needs. Secondly, with the aggressive spread of market economies and communication technology, local cultures and values are in peril. The true identity and culture are in jeopardy with the influence of alien cultures and the new generation cares less about their history and tradition.
	In conclusion, it seems to me that the drawbacks of globalisation and the similar lifestyle of people due to the similar culture in the world far outweigh the few advantages it has.
Essay 208:
	The discrimination among nations in terms of people's lifestyle, access to information, eating habits and cultural aspects are diminishing with the effect of globalisation and widespread acceptance of technology. Some people see it as a threat to cultural identity, but I take it as a positive sign in terms of improved lifestyle and a better relationship among nations. Without a doubt, the merits of this exceed the disadvantages.
	To begin with, globalisation and free trade concepts, that led to the similarities among nations, were not imposed by a rich nation on the rest of the world. Rather, it was a demand of the time that has reduced the gap among countries over time. For example, someone from a developing nation, these days, can avail the same branded clothes, food, technological devices and so on a citizen in an industrialised country can have. This not only enhances the freedom of choice for people but also opens the windows of opportunity to local brands on the international stage. If countries look more similar around the globe, it means just one thing - the wealth and life standard gaps among people are declining.
	Moreover, the trend reduces the cultural gap among nations and help maintain world peace. Also, a growing number of people nowadays go to rich nations for study and work, and similar culture makes them adapt to a foreign country more easily. Freedom of the press and easy access to global information has accelerated this trend and there is no stopping to it.
	Finally, the culture and tradition of a nation change over time even without the interference of any alien influence. Hence restricting the overwhelming facilities this trend brings is not a good idea at all, especially when the world still has a huge wealth gap and animosity among nations.
	To conclude, the wealth and power gaps among nations may lead to conflicts, and this is why people should be treated as global citizens rather than citizens of a specific country. To make this dream come true, international brands, TV channels and other global facilities should be present in every corner of the world.
Essay 209:
	Differences among nations are becoming less perceptible these days as people all over the world are sharing the same lifestyle, technology, fashion, foods, advertisements, and entertainment programmes. As a result, cultural identity and traditions are in peril. The following essay advocates that the disadvantages outweigh the benefits of this trend.
	The first benefit of this trend is that international brands can produce goods on a mass scale, and the manufacturing cost becomes cheaper. As a result, consumers enjoy the advantage of buying products from global brands at an affordable price. Secondly, people all over the world share the same culinary experience, and that is why they have more food options than ever before. For example, people around the globe can now purchase food based on their preference, whether it is Chinese, Indian or Western food or brands. Furthermore, this trend reduces the cultural barrier and brings people under a common platform where people will have more knowledge and respect about other nations and their customs.
	On the contrary, the globalisation of the fashion, entertainment and culinary industries have some severe negative sides. First, many people abandon their cultural values due to this, which hurts the identity of a country. Besides, foreign television shows have negative influences on young people. Many global TV channels, for example, show programmes that are sensitive to other cultures. However, as these shows are easily accessible nowadays, many young people follow them, and as a consequence, adopt a non-acceptable lifestyle and life choices.
	In conclusion, the globalisation of fashion, advertising, culinary and entertainment products have both advantages and disadvantages. But, carefully considering both, I strongly feel that it has more negative effects than positive aspects.

Essay 210:
	Ensuring food adequacy for the entire population has been a major concern for nations throughout the centuries. Some people believe that the government should focus on producing all kinds of food while importing as little as possible to ensure food sufficiency. I firmly believe that producing many kinds of food is an inevitable effort in terms of ensuring the nation’s food security.
	Firstly, the more a country relies on imported food, the more food crisis it faces. Food import includes transportation costs, taxation and other charges that eventually increase the food price. To tackle this problem, a government should allocate more budgets to improve national production by maximising the collaboration of research centres with farmers. Related university courses and diploma programmes can create more talented individuals who would be involved in domestic food production. Furthermore, by mass production of all kinds of food items, a country can prepare for the rainy days.
	Secondly, by focusing on farming, irrigation and planting, a government can decrease unemployment problems. For example, in Indonesia, the farming sector creates the highest percentage of jobs. More than 50 per cent of Indonesians are directly or indirectly depends on the agriculture sector.
	Finally, imported food does not have the same quality and freshness as locally produced food and crops. If food is imported from a long distance, the food value degrades and in some cases, toxic chemicals are used to preserve the imported food. Thus the local production of foods would ensure better food quality and sound health of citizens.
	In conclusion, preventing the food crisis, ensuring better food quality and decreasing unemployment could be achieved if a country becomes self-sufficient in its food production. It is expected that countries would emphasize their domestic food production as it gives many competitive advantages over importing.
Essay 211:
	Every country wants to reduce its dependency on imports while maximising its exports including items such as food and crops. However, not all countries have the same geographic location, weather condition, technology and suitable lands to produce each type of crop the citizens need. This is why a country should focus more on its overall economic growth rather than using manpower and budget to become self-reliant on food.
	To commence with, soil, weather condition, available lands, technology and demographics of a county determine what crops, vegetables and fruits it can produce. Not all countries have the same geographical features and manpower, and thus, it is obvious that the country needs to import some of the items. In many cases, this is rather advantageous than producing or growing crops and then harvesting the grains. For instance, it is impossible for an Arab country to produce all types of foods due to its weather condition. If they focus on growing these food items and engage their manpower to do that, their economic growth would be hindered.
	Moreover, a country like Germany and China can focus on manufacturing and industrial innovation while import food from other countries. The ultimate outcome is more beneficial for them. However, this might not be the case for a country that solely depends on the agriculture sector and when a majority of its population are already dependant on it. They can focus on improving their productions, but this model is not suitable for industrial countries.
	To conclude, I believe that free trade and globalisation have made the world a global village. And with the speedy transportation system, food import cost has already declined. Since fulfilling the mass people's diverse needs for various kinds of food is not feasible for a country, it should focus on its true potential rather than allocating budget and manpower to become self-dependent on food.

Essay 212:
	Governments, all around the world, have visions to fulfil, and responsibilities to carry on, and they seek to achieve the overall development of their countries for a prosperous future. Thus many governments think that economic progress is the key to success while others disagree with this notion and opine that many other aspects such as green environment, security, social values, traditions and peace among nations are more important. I personally believe that the economic success of a nation is an important goal for a government but it is not the most important one.
	To begin with, many developed countries have already gained economic progress and yet they are suffering from growing crime rates, hostile relationship with other nations, corruption and outbreaks of epidemic diseases. Thus economic progress has failed to ensure a better life standard for citizens. It proves that only economic progress should not be the vision of a government. On the contrary, without economic stability, a government cannot ensure advancement in education, defence, healthcare, international trade and social safety.
	Again, industrialisation and success in trades have ensured economic stability to many western and Asian countries, and yet the environmental damage that has been caused is overwhelming. No good money would bring to a nation if it fails to build a safe and green environment for the next generation. However, many people would also argue that it is better to bestow a prosperous country to the new generation rather than leaving them a broken economy.
	Furthermore, economic progress requires industrialisations, dominance in international trade and the use of cheap labour from other countries. History tells us that wars are imminent due to irrational competition among nations. On the contrary, without economic success, a country cannot defend itself from external threats, fight epidemic diseases and cannot ensure proper health care facilities for its citizens. Finally, some would say, with the economic progress, the country will lose its old way of living, traditional values and uniqueness as a nation. But it should also be considered that change is the fundamental basis of development and if a nation worries too much about the old ways of living, it would fail to ensure progress at a steady pace.
	In conclusion, there is no doubt that economic progress should be an important goal for a government but there are still many aspects that are equally important.
Essay 213:
	The progress of a nation is often measured by economic growth, therefore many governments focus more on their economic progress rather than other aspects. However, some people, including me, have a contrasting view as they believe that political stability, security, social condition and education are equally important for the advancement of a nation.
	On the one hand, many governments pay more attention to economic development than other aspects of life as they believe that economic growth plays an important role in the development of a nation. When a country's economy develops, it ensures business ventures, new job opportunities and the government can collect more funds through taxes. This fund could be used for the improvement of other sectors such as education, public infrastructures and military services.  
	On the other hand, even though economic growth plays an essential part, governments must ensure a better living standard and a green environment. The economic condition of a country will not grow without the support of a secure social condition, better political condition and advanced educational system. Investors will not place their investment in countries that have an insecure political condition such as Afganistan or Iraq. And then, without the existence of educated and skilled workers, it will be difficult for a country to improve their industrial and trade activities. Therefore, the growth of the economic sectors should be aligned with other important sectors.
	In conclusion, it is undeniable that economic growth plays an important role in the development of a nation. However, I personally believe that besides economic progress, better education, social welfare, security and political stability are equally important for the sustainable development of a nation.

Essay 214:
	In recent years, the role of women in society as well as in job sectors has changed to a great extent. However, it is noteworthy that higher positions in firms are still occupied by men, although women account for half of the workforce in many developed countries. While some people claim that women should be promoted more to hold these positions, I disagree with this idea as I believe that higher positions should be served by deserving people and should not be allocated based on gender.
	First, recruiting for higher positions in a company should never be based on gender, but qualifications, skills and aptitudes. This is because choosing people who cannot adapt to the working conditions will make companies confront many difficulties - even this can affect the profit, productivity and the public image. For instance, in my brother’s workplace, two women were recruited in two higher positions only because they were relatives of the owner. Within a few months, the management had to replace both of them with more competent employees. Therefore, a company should always choose the best people to serve their important positions. If a female candidate seems more promising or if an existing female employee has excellent capabilities, there should not be any problem in recruiting or promoting a woman in a higher position.
	Again, if percentage or number is the most crucial factor, I believe children should also be promoted to higher positions in a company in a developing country as their percentage in factories and industries in those countries is also high. This exemplifies why qualifications should get priority over other aspects when it comes to hiring people for higher management positions in a company.
	In conclusion, I strongly believe that employees should be recruited according to their expertise, eligibilities and talent. It is therefore recommended that women who want to play important roles in an organisation should gain those qualifications and skills. They should not be favoured only because of their gender.
Essay 215:
	Women's contribution to building a nation is equally important to that of men, and given the chance, women can be equally adept to take responsibilities in higher management positions in a company. Gender equality is no longer a concept, but a proven way to accelerate progress. I, therefore, strongly believe that a portion of higher positions in companies and organisations should be reserved for females.
	To begin with, half of the world population is women and their empowerment determines the overall progress of nations and the global economy. If these women are kept away from decision-making positions, true empowerment of nations would become impossible. To cite an example, when half of the decision-makers in a large company are females, they can bring diverse perspectives and innovation to the company. Some of the Asian countries including Bangladesh and India have incorporated reserved seats in parliaments for women, and these female leaders have done a great deal to encourage women to actively contribute to the country's politics and business sectors.
	Furthermore, women in higher positions, in the police force, for example, can better understand the crimes and injustice against women and can propose better solutions to these issues. Similarly, almost every large company has a great portion of female consumers and having some female key employees would only ensure more favourable product research, planning and productions that would better serve females and ensure more loyal female customers.
	To conclude, allocating a certain portion of higher positions for women is not a courtesy to the women. Rather it ensures a balanced working environment, innovation, happy female customers and women empowerment which are the key ingredients to sustainable progress and better business development.
Link:  "https://www.ielts-mentor.com/writing-sample/writing-task-2/2439-reducing-the-working-week-to-35-hours",
Essay 216:
	To outline the advantages, 35 working hours per week will allow employees to allocate more time for themselves and spend quality time with family and friends. Besides, they will be inspired to take part in different social and sports activities, and that will surely improve their health conditions. Moreover, the reduced working hours means more time for resting and taking vacations, and proper rest and vacations refresh our minds. Undeniably, this has a relationship with the productivity of employees in their offices. Finally, many stress-related issues are caused by overwork, and if employees work 7 hours a day, they are less likely to suffer from fatigue and stress.
	On the other hand, decreased working hours would reduce the output of employees, especially in industries and that would hike the price of different commodities. Life would become even more costly due to the increasing price. Companies, on the other hand, will have to hire more employees to maintain their productivity and thus their operational costs would increase.
	To conclude, a balanced working hour is already in place, which is 8 hours per day. Employees should work effectively during office hours and leave the office in due time. Companies should not put extra pressure and engage staff for more than 8 hours a day while the government should make sure that private companies are not violating the laws regarding the weekly working hours.
Essay 217:
	Different social and personal problems due to overwork are arguably the most concerning dilemmas in the modern world, both for developing and industrialised countries. It is suggested by many to have a 35-hours workweek schedule, as they believe it would help diminish many overwork-related issues. This essay will give an in-depth analysis of both advantages and disadvantages of the proposed working hours.
	It seems reasonable that a shorter working week can boost the demand for new employment while also provide a healthier working condition. As workers are expected to work five hours less per week, the companies have to consider additional recruitment to keep up with the former productivity, thus help in lowering the unemployment quota. Moreover, studies have highlighted the importance of granting employees a greater amount of time for resting. Not only it will lead to better performance, but also improve employee satisfaction, from which the organisations can benefit a lot.
	On the other hand, there are bound to be pitfalls once the suggestion gets passed. Economically speaking, cutting working hours can severely hurt companies’ competitiveness in the market, since they are no longer as effective. The situation may get even worse if all firms suffer from the same problem. Prices are then likely to be raised so that the expenses can be covered. Ironically, the employees, who are also customers, turn out again to be the victims of the solution suggested.
	To conclude, limiting the working week to 35 hours might sound promising but there are several potential issues, which must be thoroughly addressed before the proposal could be implemented in the real world.

Essay 218:
	Waste recycling and people’s participation in it is a moot issue, and a lot of arguments could be observed among people as well as in the media regarding this. Whether people should spontaneously take part in the recycling process or the government should make it a legal obligation needs a thorough discussion. I personally believe that government should impose laws and severely fine the violators to ensure proper waste recycling.
	To commence with, waste recycling is done by the state and citizens are expected to properly divide the recyclable and non-recyclable wastages and pack them accordingly while dumping them in recycle bins. They are expected to cooperate greatly in the recycling process. However, it is a strange fact that many people do not participate in it spontaneously either from their negligence or from their lack of time to do so.
	Moreover, it is a harsh truth that many people abide by rules only from the concern of punishment or fine, not from their conscience. For instance, when the penalty for traffic rule violation went up last year, people started following them in my city. Similarly, if laws are introduced and the authority starts penalising, more people would recycle more of their wastages.
	Finally, waste recycling is a very handy process to save our environment and we already have many rules to protect our environment. While deforesting is a severe crime in my country, there is no visible law for not recycling waste. This is why people are very careless about their waste management in our country. This is why proper laws are required.
	In conclusion, most of the citizens in our country already know about the importance of saving the environment and how individual efforts of recycling can improve environmental conditions. Since many of them still do not participate in waste recycling, there is no alternative than to impose laws to have this done.

Essay 219:
	Learning a foreign language has many advantages including augmenting knowledge about diverse cultures, having better job prospects, fostering better cognitive development, developing effective communication skills and so on. While some people believe that the only reason we should learn a foreign language is to visit or work in a foreign country, many others opine that the benefits of learning a different language are not limited to the job and travel prospects only.  This essay delves into both points of view. My opinion is that learning a foreign language goes beyond travel, migration or job prospects.
	On the one hand, it is quite natural that people want to learn a foreign language only to be able to communicate with people who speak this language. Thus a large number of people learn foreign languages like English, French, German, Spanish, Russian and Arabic to travel, migrate or find jobs in countries where people use these languages. From this regard, it seems quite logical that visiting a country or working there is the main reason people learn a second language. In my country, for example, most people learn English and Spanish while almost none learn Russian. Migration and job prospects are the reason that has established this trend, I believe.
	On the contrary, research indicates that cognitive development happens faster among children who learn a second language than those who do not. Furthermore, learning a second language is mandatory in an academic syllabus and this helps us understand diverse cultural and traditional aspects. People who know more languages are capable of reading more books, and understanding the lifestyle of different nationalities. Again, learning a foreign language helps us make new friends. Thus it is evident that learning a foreign language has many other benefits as well.
	In conclusion, there is no denying the fact that people primarily learn a foreign language to travel to or work in a developed country. But it is quite evident that there are far many advantages of learning a foreign language than to work or migrate to a country.

Essay 220:
	Every government works hard so that citizens can commute safely and quickly while businesses get a solid transportation system for trade facilities. Thus when the question arises whether a government should focus on improving its railways or roads, people have divided opinions. I personally agree that the government should spend more money on the railway system.
	Fast of all, railways offer a safer commuting experience both for the citizens and traders. The numbers of road accidents and highway casualties in many countries, for example, are far higher than that of railway accidents. Thus investing in a safer mode of transportation is a much more prudent idea. Moreover, rails cause comparatively less environmental pollutions while road vehicles are the main reason for increasing pollution and around the world.
	Second, rails can carry hundreds of people and several hundred tonnes of goods at a time while road transports not built for that. Some shuttle trains are many times faster than that those of private cars and public buses. Thus improved railways would save peoples’ valuable time every day. Thirdly, rail lines are usually away from the main cities and that is why some busy cities have no other alternatives than to improve their rail transportation system. Express trains can reduce the traffic congestion in metro areas, and more investment to improve the railway is the only possible solution in many cities where population density is high.
	Finally, the population of the world is increasing rapidly, and that is why investing more money in a faster and reliable transportation system is more logical than investing in the older transportation system. Railways will be the future in the transportation sector, and investment in it is the better choice for any government.
	In conclusion, I believe that a government, either in a developed or a developing country, should invest to build a safer, faster and more reliable transportation system, and the railway, for this reason, should get an obvious priority.
Essay 221:
	Some people believe that a government should invest more in the rail system and build more railroads rather than diverting funds to improving highways and road transportation systems. To a certain point, I would agree with the statement, but I also believe that the decision of building railways or roads should be made based on the natural conditions of the area and the preference of citizens.
	On the one hand, it is understandable if some people opine that a government should expand more railroads rather than roads and streets. Firstly, it is obvious that when a country has extensive rail networks, it will positively affect the logistic cost. The selling price of many goods would be cheaper since a single locomotive could carry tonnes of crops, goods or liquor. Secondly, by building integrated subway stations in city areas, traffic congestion could be avoided. For example, as Singapore has a very good train network, called MRT, most of the people rarely drive on their vehicles. As a result, Singapore is free from traffic congestion and air pollution.
	On the other hand, it is also important for a government to do some feasibility studies about the geological conditions of an area before planning to improve railroads. It is a fact that some areas might not be suitable for railways, as those areas might have swamps or rocky mountains, for example. If the government finalise building railway networks, the investment cost might be unreasonably high. For instance, Borneo in Indonesia is one of the largest islands in the world, but most of the areas are swamps. So it is not suitable for railroads but good for an integrated water and road transportation system. Finally, the preference of citizens should also be considered before investing in construction on railroads or highways.
	In conclusion, a government should invest in building railroads where applicable, but should also analyse thoroughly before spending money solely on railways. The authority needs to ensure that their areas are suitable for rail networks and people prefer that transportation system.

Essay 222:
	Schools are considered to be the lighthouse of a nation, and if education is the backbone of a nation, schools are the place to build it. However, the main objective of academies is a never-ending debate. I agree that a school's main purpose should be to turn students into honest and good citizens and making them ready to work for society instead of turning them into selfish money-making machines by helping them individually just to be ready to get a job.
	First, the main purpose of education is to build up an enlightened nation where morality, honesty and integrity would be the key characteristics. They would keep aside their personal ambitions, and work together for the betterment of the country. Since a school is a place where pupils' education is taken care of, its chief objective should be to focus on nurturing morality and good human characteristics among the students while also preparing them for their careers that would benefit society. To exemplify, if talented and experienced doctors treat patients only for the money, healthcare for all would be a distant dream. So, to build a nation where people will help each other instead of turning into money-making machines, we should focus on our education system, especially what we teach our children.
	Second, states spend a lot of money to keep the schools and their education system running. A major portion of this spending comes from the tax money. From this regard, if schools plan to adopt an education system where teachers’ sole purpose would be to teach children how to be personally benefitted from jobs or businesses, the whole education system would collapse. We have to be very careful while educating our children. What we teach them in their early stages would shape them, and if the schools fail to teach them to become ideal citizens, it would be a great concern in the future. Moreover, personal benefits, good grades and a better career should not be the main reasons children attend schools. They should attend schools to become enlightened members of society.
	In conclusion, making ideal citizens and dedicated workers should be the true objective of our schools. The greater good of society, the bright and prosperous future of a nation, and the personal achievements of individuals are connected with the way we teach our children in schools and that is why our education should focus on morality and quality.

Essay 223:
	Technology has given people wings to fly, but along with that, it has made them lethargic. One such technological advancement is television. With different kinds of content being lined up on television, sport is one such programme which is watched and enjoyed by all groups of people, and the ongoing craze of different sports on television has inspired the young generation to a great extent. Now the question arises if this trend is supposed to be blamed for the poor health of the young generation or not. This essay delves into this issue.
	The more they watch their favourite sports on TV, the more they become addicted to watching it, whilst the evolution of sports on television was not meant to do that. The motive to promote sports on televisions was to inform people of sports activities and to instil a feeling of vigour and enthusiasm in people, particularly among young people, so that they take part in different sports. However, these days, the young generation takes watching sports on television as a leisure activity. Instead of inspiring, it has rather instilled a feeling of apathy about taking part in outdoor sports among youth by occupying their free time.
	Moreover, the young one's, these days, just love to have a gala time watching sports. They no more feel the need to go out and partake in physical activities which in turn has affected their health. According to some recent statistics, more than 80% of youths watch major football tournaments on TV, a many-fold rise than the last decade, but the actual participants in football in real life have considerably decreased than our past generation.
	In my view, there is no harm in watching sports on television sometimes. But if it exceeds the desired time limit then the alarm has to be raised. Along with watching sports, they should take part in these sports in the fields and outdoors.

	Sport has truly become one of the most entertaining and popular television shows these days. A group of people believe that these sport shows have negative effects on young people, as they prefer to watch those games on television rather than exercising or taking part in them in their free time. To a certain point, I would agree with the statement, but I also believe that its effects depend on the personality of each individual.
	It is a fact that the number of sports channels has increased rapidly in recent years. Cable channels such as ESPN, Ten Sports, Star Sports, Fox Sports and so on broadcast attractive sports and live competitions all day long. As a consequence, many young people watch television for several hours just to watch these games. The condition gets worst as they are also consuming unhealthy food such as popcorn, candies and soda when they watch these shows. Therefore, a lot of people believe that these channels have been the main cause of bad health conditions of young generation nowadays.
	Having said that, these sports programmes should not be primarily blamed for youngsters' poor health conditions as there are other factors which affect the health of young people. Firstly, many parents do not teach their children about a healthy lifestyle. They let their children watch television, play video games and chat on mobile phones for many hours a day and do not take them outdoors. The popularity of different junk foods and soda is the reason many young people's health condition is deteriorating.
	In conclusion, to a certain extent, I would agree that sports programmes on TV have some negative effects on the health condition of young people, but, I also believe that there are other equally and more important factors which can also lead to poor health situation among youngsters.

Essay 225:
	Recently, a great number of accidents on the road have caused by the careless drivers. Some people think that giving stricter punishment is the answer to tackling the driving offender problems, however, I disagree that it is the only way.
	First and foremost, even the best rules have been established and imposed it would be useless if drivers have no self-conscious in following the driving law. For example, there are harsh punishments when we are driving while drinking, but in the reality considerable road accidents caused by drunk driver still exist. Thus, the main focus of this issue is all about the awareness as a driver, not just concerning on the punishment.
	In addition, a government could help to improve the safety on the road by broadcasting the background knowledge of how important it is to drive prudently. It could increase drivers' conscious about the danger that could happen only because breaking simple policy, such as the driver might take someone's life with passing the traffic light. Then, the socialisation program is probably given in the process of making their driving license card to ensure every driver would receive the information.
	Furthermore, the private companies, such as IT companies and transport mode companies, could collaborate with the government to create a "Smart Transportation Mode". The new software will be attached in a car or a bike which is able to detect the speed limit of the vehicle and the level of the alcohol in driver's body and stops when it reaches a certain limit. The other possibility is that the software will turn off the car's or bike's machine if it is too close to other kinds of transportation modes or other things. Hence, one of the road accidents like a crash a can be prevented.
	In conclusion, giving the tighten punishment is a brilliant idea, however, I believe there are still other excellent thoughts to boost the safety on the road.

Essay 226:
	Every year a number of wild animals are being extinct and the increasing number of endangered species worldwide is an alarming issue for us. Some people are in the opinion that we should try to save all the wild animals while others believe that we should emphasise on saving some selective wild animals.
	First of all, wild animals are part of our eco-system and they have as much share as we have on this Earth. Due to exploit and overuse of natural resources by humans, many such wild animals are getting wiped out. Since we, human, are the main reasons their existence are in danger, it is our obligation to protect them. While planning and executing our steps to save wild animals, we should never select some wild animals while letting others die. In fact, it is quite unclear what would be the determining factors for our biassed selection? Many people, in this case, would argue that we should focus on saving wild animals which are fewer in numbers and have greater chances of extinction like Royal Bengal Tigers and Pandas. However, I disagree. If we take proper steps to save wild animals, that would include any wild animal found around us. For instance, if we can ensure a natural inhabitation of all wild animals and prohibit any actions that might threaten them, would actually save all the wild animals.
	When saving some selective wild animals, many argue that geological garden could a safe place for them. In fact, the reality is quite contrary. We should not put wild animals in cages and should let them freely live in their natural living place. International organisations like UN, UNESCO, WWF, Wildlife Alliance etc. sometimes work on saving endangered animals but that does not restrict their activities for saving those wild animals only. They have broader plans and several initiatives for saving all the wildlife animals.
	Finally, our won activities like logging trees, increasing use of cars, expanding cities, luxury, rampant hunting of animals etc. are the main threats to every wild animal in the world and the time has come for us to step forward and stop such activities. Saving every wild animal is a dire need not only to maintain the natural balance but also for our own well-being.
	In conclusion, we should save every wild animal that is still present in the world. Selecting some wild animals for saving is an idea we should discard as it would bring more devastating effects than positive ones.
Essay 227:
	People have different opinions about saving and protecting wild animals. A group of people believe that all wild animals should be protected while others think that we should only preserve several ones. The following paragraphs will discuss both views in detail, but I personally believe that all wild animals should be conserved.
	For a number of reasons, some people believe that not all wild animals should be preserved. Firstly, they believe that the overpopulation of wild animals could become a threat for our existence. For example, should the population of Zebra and Wildebeest in Africa is protected, then the existence of these animals might become overpopulated, and as a result, they might explore the farming areas in Africa. Secondly, conserving wild animals requires a large amount of money. They believe that these funds should be allocated for humanity issues, as many third world countries are still struggling against starvation and deathly diseases.
	However, others think that all wild animals must be protected. The main reason behind this view is that all of the wild animals plays an important role in the ecosystem. Should there be one of these animals extinct, then the ecosystem would be unbalanced and it might have a catastrophic effect on the environment. Another reason is that the existence of these wild animal is beneficial for human beings. Scientists have found out that some wild animals could be used as a medical treatment, such as the blood of a snake which can be used to heal skin diseases. There is another reason that forms the opinion that all wild animals are important and should be equally protected. The reason explains that if we protect some selected wild animals, others might get extinct and then we will damage the biodiversity of the world.     
	In conclusion, a number of people believe that we should protect all wild animals, while others think that we should only preserve some of them. Both groups have their own opinions, but I strongly believe that we should conserve all wild animals.

Essay 228:
	Without any doubt, education is the key to development for a nation and only a well-educated nation could thrive for excellence and ultimate development. However, when the discussion topic is whether education system is the only critical issue for the development of a country, I quite disagree with this view. I personally believe that citizens’ skill development, increasing export, international relationship, better life standard, better utilisation of internal resources, technological development are other important and critical factors which must be combined with the educational system of a country for its  true and sustainable development.
	First of all, education is considered to be the backbone of a nation and it is quite obvious that education system of a country has an immense role in the overall development of a country. Most of the developed countries have well-educated citizens and exemplary education system – which represents the importance of education system for the development of a county. However, there are countries like Sri Lanka with an educated nation and better education facilities and still suffering from poverty and struggling to become a developed nation. This indicates that education system could never be the only consideration for development.
	Second, only better GDP and revenue reserve cannot be the true indicators of the development. Overall life standard, healthcare facility, safety, freedom of speech and thoughts, sustainable economic growth and a healthy environment are also important for a country to become a developed one. For instance, many middle-eastern countries have a huge reserve of foreign currency and source of national income and yet their citizens suffer from war, chaos and they have little freedom of thoughts. Such a nation might have a very strong economy and superior education system, but peace is absent there. Thus I do not recognise them as developed countries.
	Japan, does not have a strong educational system comparing with many other European countries and yet they are one of the richest and most developed countries in the world. They have properly utilised their possibility, national resources and have maintained a better global trade relationship. This country is a prime example of how skilled and hard working citizens can help improve their nation.
	Finally, many Asian countries have gained prominent economic growth in the last few years by adopting latest technology and they are soon going to be developed countries. They, no doubt, have improved their educational system over the period but they have not relied on this single factor. Increasing export, international relationship, better leadership and democratic government are some other crucial factor for many other countries to be promoted as a developed country.
	In conclusion, I believe that a better education system, along with skilled population, better leadership, international trade and relationship, better lifestyle, freedom of speech, technological development, enhanced export and utilisation of internal resources can make sure the development of a nation, not alone.
Essay 229:
	Nowadays, many people give much more focus on how to create the better education system in order to ensure the country's development. A majority of people believe that the education system is the only essential method for that, however, I do disagree with that statement.
	First and foremost, even the best education system could be useless if many people still live in the poor condition. They have to work hard to continue their life consequently they prefer avoiding the education because time spent in schools could be used to earn money. Subsequently, the education system will not increase significantly like the prediction of the people. If a country fails to ensure enough job opportunities, an educated future generation will make much more problems than predicted since neither will they get involved in works like irrigation nor will be able to manage a suitable job.
	Furthermore, development of a country would probably be achieved slightly by tackling the urgent factors like famine and health care issues. Those factors are more crucial than the education system. The excellent intelligence which we have gotten through education will be of no importance if we are in unhealthy.  Nutrition, sports facilities and vocational training are thus more important in this scenario.
	Developed countries like the USA, the UK, Australia, Canada, and Japan have more educated citizens than that of underdeveloped countries. However, they can nowadays ensure proper education system only because they had been able to ensure basic human needs properly first. Countries like Sri Lanka and many others have higher education rate than many developed countries and yet they failed to become affluent nations.  Thus, before people go too far to focus on th education system, they should have covered all of the fundamentals first.
	In conclusion, education system, no doubt, is a very important factor for the overall development of a nation but this is not the only factor for the development. Many other important aspects must be considered and implemented for the real development in a county.
Essay 230:
	Many people believe that education is the most important factor for a country's development. I personally agree that education is one of the most important components for the growth of any country, but there are other crucial factors that should be considered by the government and the people. The following paragraphs will explain in details about both views and will show my position on this issue.
	On the one hand, it is true that education plays an important role in the progress of a nation. As more and more people become educated, common society issues will soon be decreasing. For example, in the past, the percentage of illiterate people in China was around 50%. Consequently, many of the people were living in poverty as most of their occupation were low skill workers with low incomes. But then the government realised these inconvenient conditions and tried to develop the education system. Some of the programs were giving free educations for the children and providing scholarships for scientists and engineers. As a result, the country has experienced a significant increase in the economic sectors, and now China plays a significant role in the world economy.  
	On the other hand, there are other factors that should be improved and one of them would be health. Countries that have a good healthcare system will have healthier residents which affect the productivity of the labours. Another crucial factor would be technology as it plays a significant role in the development of a country in this modern era. For example, agricultural countries that use technology for their farming activities will be more productive than the old fashioned ones. As they use tools such as tractors and bulldozers, they will be faster in planting and cultivating their lands compared to the traditional ones.  
	In conclusion, I disagree if education is the only factor that would develop a nation. I do believe that education plays an important role in the development of a country, but there are other factors that should be considered by the government as well, such as health and technology.

Essay 231:
	The significant rises of the population, fast paced life, crime rate and dependency on technology in the urban areas make more people become unacquainted and unfriendly to their neighbours. However, there are measures that can be taken to alleviate this issue.
	In today’s technology dependent era, people are mostly busy with their own work. Major streets in the cities are filled with busy people walking fast to reach their office or business place. They are even busy talking to their office colleagues and family members over the phone. After they return home late evening, they watch television, use computer and the Internet or spend time with family members. They scarcely have any time to socialise with neighbours. In some scenarios, people do not even know who live next door in city areas. These are the everyday scenarios in the cities where social interactions could be rarely seen as individuals have no time to socialise and much focused on their own work or personal interests.
	Again, the rampant acceleration of crimes in the urban community makes individual become unnecessarily cautious and suspicious about other people, especially with the people they meet for the very first time. Even trusting their own neighbourhood would be tough for them as they are in constant fear of being harmed. As a result inhabitants of cities tend to become isolated as they are afraid to mingle because of undeveloped acquaintance. Unlike rural areas, where comparatively fewer people live together, city areas are highly populated and it is not unlikely that several thousands of people live in a block. Maintaining social relationship with all of them is this thus quite impossible.     
	On the other hand, considering possible measures to improve a sense of community in the neighbourhood community officials must organise programmes regularly to encourage camaraderie. Secondly, building more parks, social gathering places, community centres and children’s playground in the community could be a good measure to let people socialise and know each other. This is also helpful for meeting friends, bonding with family and neighbours. As a result, people living in the community would develop a sense of friendship. Positive news and events among community members should be highlighted in media to eradicate the fear people have about unknown people. Finally, organising different community groups to help people find others with same interest and to share common passions is a very effective measure to help people enhance their neighbouring bonds and relationship in my opinion.
	To sum it up, city life and overwhelming population should not be hindrances to our sense of community and our relationship with our neighbours. It would be nicer for the community to develop a friendly environment to create a better place to live in with all the neighbours.

Essay 232:
	People have different views about grouping students in different classes- some prefer this grouping based on students’ academic skill while others prefer mixing students in a group. Although there are some good reasons to think that students with same performance level and ability in a group have more advantages, in my opinion, a mixed-ability education system should be carried out in schools.
	For several reasons it can be argued that student segregation by grades and same ability should be allowed in schools and should be grouped together. Firstly, high performing groups can be taught at a right speed by teachers. Who then would be able to plan their lecture by looking at students capability of how quickly they can absorb knowledge and new lessons. This will allow teachers to cover the course at a faster pace. Secondly, high-achievers will be more motivated if they are acknowledged as the most intelligent, talented and gifted peers. This sense of being superior will also help them to work hard and eventually become a successful, prosperous and competitive member of the future workforce. If a classroom has students of similar abilities and learning capability, they find it more interesting to perform and excel in their studies. The teachers do not need to put any special emphasis to teach them which is quite helpful for a good learning environment.
	However, I believe in the current system of mix education in schools, where students with different academic capabilities are being taught in the same class. Students in this system will be more confident and more competitive if they are not subject to grading based segregation. Less capable students would have more opportunities to interact with brilliant students if both are being taught in the same group. So it will not only encourage cooperation but also competition with their class-fellows. Furthermore, segregating less capable pupils in mid-range or lower level groups would cause resentment in them with lower self-esteem. This is because children do not really want to be seen as less intelligent or less privileged. Also, they are prone to be violent or get involved in a gang culture just to make themselves prominent in society or to satisfy their confidence. Some low-achievers might end up attaining worse grades than before since a sense of competition is less likely to be found in the class of less capable pupil. Also, comparatively less intelligent students will not get the confidence of competing in the job markets in future, if they are kept in low-quality classes.
	In conclusion, grouping pupils by their achievement level have few positive effects on high performing students but still this is a harmful way to education a nation. I would rather argue that mixed-ability oriented classes should be encouraged in schools as it will benefit all students.

Essay 233:
	Latest technological inventions like mobile phones and computers have made communication much more convenient, easier and less expensive. Some people consider it as the revolution in the communication system, while some others opine that this advancement has reduced our bonding and made our relationship less personal. There is no double that with the widespread usage of cell phones, pagers, text messages, social networking websites and Internet calling, letter writing has already become less popular but I do not agree that this it will ever disappear.
	To begin with, letter writing is a traditional way of communication among people from different parts of the world. Even until now with the dominance of technology like email, letter writing has its importance and supremacy in authoritative, official and personal communication. Letter writing is still the best way to congratulate someone, write to a government office or to write to a dear friend.
	Second, it is a formal writing and some business companies ask their applicants to write an application letter to measure their capability in communicating by means of writing. Secondly, letter writing can be a source of documentation that can be utilised as strong evidence in the court. Email fraud is common these days and someone with advance knowledge can send an email from any email address he wants. This makes an email less authoritative as strong evidence.     
	In addition, people applying for fiancée visa can send love letters to the embassy as proof of the relationship to a foreign individual as additional documentation purposes. Thirdly, individual living in a remote area of a countryside still need to write letters since the Internet is yet to be available there. The number of such areas is quite large and they rely on letter writing for communication. Thus, people prefer to use letter writing as a form of sending important messages- be it to love one’s or business transaction purposes. The personal touch, affection and sincerity a hand written letter can convey could not be found in an email or text message.
	Lastly, letter writing is the only way to improve someone’s writing skills. Computerised grammar and spell checking facilities are often the reason many modern-era students do not have excellent writing and grammatical command. On the other hand habit of letter writing enhance someone ability to write better. It will also help them become more creative and imaginative in creating a very excellent output of writing.
	In my point of view, letter writing will not be abolishing in future because it possesses a significant importance in communication, especially in measuring the ability of individual’s writing, creativity and appropriate and clever way of writing. Letter writing is entirely beneficial in honing to become an effective communicator. The importance of letter writing in offices, courtrooms, among friends and lovers will always help it to survive.

Essay 234:
	With the development of new technologies, people’s life is now more comfortable than it was in the past. In these days it is almost unimaginable that one modern household functions without refrigerators, washing machines, microwave oven, and other appliances. A rapid development of these technologies brings with itself a lot of advantages, but negatively effects these useful technological devices have on humans and environment could not be ignored.
	With today’s available consumer goods, people do not have much trouble to keep their foods or clothes in the condition that will be useful for them in every occasion. Time spent in preparation of food, washing or ironing of clothes, is far less these days than it used to be in the past, and thanks to new technologies. Just hundred years ago it was unimaginable that you could keep your meats and other food items for months, to prepare some meals in just a couple of minutes or to wash a large number of clothes in just 30 minutes. That is the biggest advantage of these consumer goods, Modern people spend far less time in doing house chores than they used to. In this way, people can save time, and time is the most valuable aspect in the modern society.
	But, on the other hand, use of appliances in such huge quantity brings with itself higher energy consumptions that lead to a higher environmental pollution all around the world. Since most of our energy is produced from the fossil fuels and coals, further increasing of energy consumption will lead to greater consumption of these non-renewable resources of energy which harm our environment. Even today the Earth is on the highest level of pollution in its history. So it is understandable why people warn on use and overuse of consumer goods.    
	At the end, modern appliances are invented to make people’s life easier and they are successful in that, but the question is- 'what cost it will bound us to pay?' I am sure that in the future these consumer goods will be more energy efficient with lesser energy consumptions for their work, and that will still make the life of people easier and more convenient like they do today.
Essay 235:
	It is a fact that more families these days have electronic households such freezers, vacuum cleaner, hair dryer, room heater, water heater and laundry machines than ever before. This trend has some positive and negative aspects but I personally believe that it has more disadvantages than advantages and this is due to the environmental damage they cause.
	It is noticed that the number of families that have consumer goods at their home has increased rapidly in the past few years. The main reason behind this trend is because of people’s busy lifestyle. They have less time to do their household activities and therefore they are relying on their electronic devices. For example, city people who are busy with their works are relying on their microwave oven and cooker for preparing their meals. The oven could be utilised for preparing instant food which would save some time for them. Therefore, some people believe that the existence of electronic household devices brings a lot of benefits for them.
	On the other hand, another group of people believe that it is not a good trend because they think that these devices could have some negative effects on the human body. For instance, devices such as microwave ovens or refrigerators produce radiation that could result a serious threat to the human body. In such cases, the usage of microwave oven has triggered serious diseases such as tumour and cancer. Another example would be about the usage of CFC as it is used in electronic products such as air conditioner and freezer. Many people do not realise that the usage of CFC has a fatal effect on the environment, as it triggers global warming. No doubt the modern electronic devices that we use daily have made our life easier and brought many luxuries in our life but the damages those devices cause is a big threat in our existence.    
	In conclusion, it is true that the number of people who own electronic household devices has grown significantly in the past few years. In spite of all the benefits, I personally believe that it has more drawbacks for our life, as these electronic products could have some serious effects on our body and the environment as well.

Essay 236:
	With around eight billion population in the world, many cities have little spaces to accommodate the growing number of population and their housing. Thousands of people are moving to the urban areas each day for better jobs, modern facilities, education and healthcare services only to increase the woes the cities already have. To solve the housing and other pressing issues due to the booming of the population, many people opine that constructions of new cities near rural areas is the best solution while others have a different view on this. The second group supports regeneration of cities rather than building new towns close to country sides. Establishing new cities in the vicinity of the countrysides has its advantages and drawbacks.
	First of all, building new cities near the countrysides would require a huge budget. Since many underdeveloped and developed countries already have a scarcity of budgets even to support the basic needs of citizens, taking such initiatives would uplift their debts only. Besides, constructing new cities close to country sides would require destroying farming lands and natural geography which will have severe consequences including deforestation and degradation of lands. Further, such cities would be far away from the main cities and if the government fails to provide every facility that the already established cities have, people would not stay there and this possess a chance of the wastage of money in the long run. Finally, many cities already have severe congestion problem and building such new cities near rural areas would make the situation worse as people’s necessity for commuting to these new cities would increase.
	On the other hand, accurate planning and proper execution of establishing new cities near rural areas rather than regenerating existing cities have many merits. First of all, this would be an excellent way to solve the housing problems many cities have. If the government can ensure proper facilities in the newly constructed cities, the pressure on current cities would decrease tremendously. This would result in less traffic congestion, decentralisation, less pollution and better life standard in both types of cities. Newly built cities would open many new job facilities and that would help the adjacent rural areas to develop as well. No doubt the constructions would require a huge budget, but the government will have an excellent opportunity to control many business sectors there to earn a steady revenue. Finally, these new cities would have modern buildings and new constructions which would fight better against the natural calamities like the earthquake.
	In conclusion, building new cities near rural areas is a plan that can bring many amenities both for the citizens and the government in a country. It can be an excellent way for solving housing and pollution problems in existing cities though some negative consequences of this plan should be taken into consideration.

Essay 237:
	Quality health care is a basic need for all citizens in a country regardless of their economic or social statuses and the government should take every effort possible to ensure superior health care facilities for all of its citizens. I quite agree with the notion that government is responsible for ensuring high-level health care service of all its citizens, no matter what their economic levels are.
	First of all, every government has a responsibility to ensure some basic needs to its citizens and health care is one of the most important aspects that a government should take care. Only a corrupted and inefficient government would discriminate among its rich and poor citizens and thus would build a country where rich will enjoy all the facilities while poor people would be deprived in every step.
	Second, in this modern era, most of the countries, specifically in democratic countries, have a government selection model where people decide who would rule the country. The participating parties give their agenda and the list of developments they would implement for the progress of the country. In most of the cases high-level health care facility gets special emphasise in their pre-election agenda and if the government fails to ensure this facility, it is kind of a violation of their promise to the whole nation.
	It is not unlikely that the government cannot offer better healthcare facilities in public hospitals while the rich people get far better treatments and diagnosis from the private healthcare facilities. This is a scenario which is quite unexpected and should not be the case in an ideal legislative system. All the citizens in a country are equal to the law and constitution and the facilities they are expected to get from the country has no way to be different.
	In conclusion, when people need to spend a lot of money to get quality health care service, then we can easily assume that the government has failed to establish a proper healthcare sector for all the people. In the same way ensuring quality health care facilities to all the citizens of a country is a responsibility no government can deny.

Essay 238:
	Many foreign universities have a dual policy in case of their tuition fees as they charge foreign students higher than the local students. International students often need to pay up to 400 percent more than local students when it comes to higher education in countries like Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the UK. This is also the case in many other countries and a government's obligation to its citizens, enforcing national privilege, tax payment by the local people and restricting the numbers of international students are the main reasons, I believe.
	To begin with, different tuition fees for local and international students gives an impression that ‘you are not equal’ and when we are fighting for the equal rights in every country, the discrimination in the university tuition fee seems like an unfair one. However, the university authority often states that this is a policy that actually ensures better educational environment and fairness in the university campuses. First reason they mention for the different higher education fees is the government’s obligation to its citizens. A government has a natural obligation to education its citizens while educating foreign students is not a direct obligation it has. This also ensures that a government is enforcing the national privilege to its citizens while using the extra money earned from the international students for the improvement of the university education. Third, citizens of a country pay the tax to the government and thus should get the privilege in educating their next generation. Finally, higher university education costs help to control the international students' flow in a country.
	To conclude, providing some opportunities to the local university students is not a bad idea but imposing up to 5x charges to the international students is an unfair policy in my opinion. It's unbelievable how far the university authorities are willing to push international students to get their pay and earn the extra money. In this age of globalisation and equal rights, this is not justified at all.

Essay 239:
	It is safe to say that robots and other powerful and intelligent machines will accompany humans even more in the future, and they will perform duties that historically belonged to us. As a result, we will enjoy more time off. To my mind, this evolution has its pros and cons which I aim to analyze in this essay.
	On the one hand, undeniably people will receive countless benefits when robots take over their usual tasks. With the massive span of free time, people can have many recreational activities that they could not fulfil in the past - like travelling for longer periods of time. This tendency is expected to come along with the development in the service industry that accounts for a high percentage of a country's GDP. Additionally, the workforce is facing contentious problems regarding their mental and physical health, once robots and smart machines come under usage, the workers will no longer be worried about such illness which will reduce the burden on the medical system as well.
	On the other hand, all the drawbacks of it can not be contained easily, it has been proven by science that humans only survive by working, while they are working on their jobs, their body parts are also working, that is what keeps them healthy and physically controlled. But if our tasks are fully done by robots, we will become lethargic and it is extremely negative for our health. People also find happiness in their jobs, which means if they have too much time relaxing, they might end up feeling bored rather than satisfied.
	In conclusion, I believe that robots replacing humans in daily tasks can be positive and negative at the same time. Humans should try to balance the amount of robot-completed work with self-completed work in order to terminate all the shortcomings.
Essay 240:
	We live in a modern world where the domination of machines is notable to an extreme extent. A wide variety of machines is already performing numerous tasks in a perfect manner and at an unbelievable speed. The sole aim of the machines is to offer us comfort, and in the future, we will have more leisure hours as machines will do most of our tasks. But this comfort and free time will come at a cost. This essay outlines both the benefits and problems of this.
	To commence with, machines are meant to ease human activities and in the future, more powerful machines will evolve to do most of our works. Usually, machines are able to perform tasks faster and more accurately than humans, and in the future, they will just do that. So, they will be considered the substitute for humans in many tasks which require arduous labour and physical challenges. At the same time, machines are great multitaskers. For instance, a computer can analyse a massive amount of data in a single second. This is why in the future, machines will be used in production, cleaning, constructions, war, research, and as a result human will have more leisure time.
	On the contrary, there are some detrimental impacts of machines doing most of our tasks, and this will be severe in the future. Certainly, machines will relieve us from repetitive tasks, but they will create some complexities too. When people will leave manual works, the risks of health disorders will increase. They may get affected with several life-tolling diseases for physical inactivity that they used to do before engaging machines for their comforts. Besides, I believe that machines will also cause severe unemployment in many sectors. When machines will be used for large-scale production in factories, many human labours will be eliminated from those jobs. The dependency on machines would be extreme and due to this a single instance of failure or wrong instruction would bring catastrophic results.  
	To conclude, I think it is imperative to deploy machines in only some specific sectors which are beyond the reach of humans. Further, the increased leisure will make life boring for us, and so we should be engaged in the ordinary tasks to enjoy a happy and healthy life.

Essay 241:
	It is true that a large number of people decide to take part in a career and earn money while the intention develops from the early stages of their life. As a result, they are happy with their working life. The view may vary but I completely agree to this.
	Frequently, the dream of taking up a career begins in early part of life. When kids are in schools, they compose essays on ‘Aim in Life’ where they mention about intentions to do in their adulthood. Consequently, they try to get into the track they cherished and most of them win the career and grow well in all terms. So, when they are in desired track, they are satisfied with their working life. The early career gives enough time for thinking or even switching career. People who start working at an early stage have better skills and better control of their professional life.
	In opposite, in my life, I have met with some unhappy people with their career path. They blame misfortune because they wanted to take something else as their career but they are to work on a completely different track which brings the sense of dissatisfaction. For instance, a science graduate who is a friend of mine is now handling banking transactions and an English graduate friend of mine is solving Chemistry problems in a lab! It really turns troublesome for them to bring satisfaction in their career as neither they were ready to deal with the matters nor they had intentions. Most of these people start their career at a later stage and become stuck to something.  
	For a satisfying working life, I believe, people would like to have some specific issues in line with their regular salaries like a cosy working environment, flexible working hours and some extra benefits etc. If they have the facilities, they would be able to focus more on the work which gradually will bring the sense job satisfaction. However, my personal experience taught me that job satisfaction for all employees ios not possible and people's expectation for their jobs vary to a great extent. Nevertheless, my personal opinion is that a contented employee would usually seek for job security, better salary and health working environment.   
	To conclude, it should be kept in mind that we work to live a happy life, and if the working conditions can enhance the living we become happier. Starting a career at an early age has several advantages and happy employees are those who feel secured at their jobs and get a better salary.

Essay 242:
	Everyone wants to maintain a perfect health but it is difficult to obtain this especially in this modern era with a changing lifestyle where people remain busy most of the time. So, the adults engage in different sports and pastimes to stay fit and healthy. But both sports and pastimes have advantages and disadvantages. A brief of the matter is discussed below.  
	First of all, tennis is preferred for its several advantages. It helps to make the body fit and reduces risks for diseases like diabetes, heart disorders etc. Overall mental health is also achieved from this sport. But the most important disadvantage is – tennis is not fit for everyone. Adults over 45 are suggested not to participate in tennis. They might be unable to stroke with the heavy racket or may not move in the court speedily. Besides, this is a costly sport as well.
	Second, walking is a very good form of physical exercise and applicable for people of any age. It helps to reduce weight, burn fats and maintain a healthy lifestyle. But it has some demerits as well. Extensive walking may weaken bone joints. Besides, walking provides a slow benefit. It reduces weight in exchange for longer times. My dad takes a morning walk every day to shed his extra pounds but the results are unremarkable. He has been walking for last three months.
	Finally, people join clubs for passing leisure hours. It offers recreational acts like playing cards, having a group chat etc. Such events develop a sense of comfort to the club-goers. In fact, a club improves mental faculties. But there are no physical benefits as it is derived from physical movements.
	At the end, I believe physical activities should be taken to maintain a healthy living and lifestyle. Only fit people may seek the opportunity to join a club as they need less physical movements. Besides, the remaining people should take sports but after their physical strength and ability.

Essay 243:
	We all dream of a peaceful and happy life but often the life is disturbed by the crime and criminals. As a result, the quality of life becomes poorer. It is more prevalent in the developed countries. There are several causes that lead to the problem and those are described in the following paragraphs in brief.
	Lack of childhood parental care is one of the leading issues for crime in the developed countries,- believe many social activists. Kids exercise violence from their high schools and it happens as they lack the right guidance and parental care. Since they are not taken care by parents, they commit different sorts of crime and there are lots of examples in Europe and the USA where the young people have been found guilty in different crime situations – even in murder.
	Secondly, I believe, insecurity and discrimination lead people to break the law. When they cannot get their rights as they were supposed to be, they try taking control of the rights themselves which consequently leads to criminal activities. A kid of a single mother or single father family is more prone to commit crimes and a 1983 study reveals that 60% of child abuse occurred in such conditions by the mother or the father which lead to a behavioural disorder among them and inspire in violating the law.
	So, solving the issue appears really daunting as the problem did not grow overnight. The corrective measures should come first from the family. When a child will know about its social responsibilities and how things work, it will behave in order. The parents, teachers and other relatives have to take responsibility for children to make them better citizens. The government must make sure that the citizens have the access to proper education and other human rights. A combination effort of both people and the government is required to tackle the crime.  
	In summary, a sense of security should be developed among adult people feeling threatened by the society and thus they could be prevented from being outlaws. I think some motivational attempts from government may be helpful in this case in line with the parental care.

Essay 244:
	When it comes to fashion and new trends, one of the most significant factors come to our mind is that many individuals excessively follow the most novel fashions ranging from outfits or hairstyles to home design. In this essay, some reasons behind this phenomenon and some serious drawbacks contributed by this habit are going to be discussed.
	People’s notion of beauty could be the main incentive for spending time and money to follow latest fashion and styles. To achieve it they do a lot of things including purchasing branded dress, shoes, ornaments and regularly visiting beauty parlours, spa centres and so on. Being beautiful and attractive is one of the most delightful feelings which human-being are keen to experience. Having updated styles in terms of appearance could widely gift such feeling. Moreover, many people believe that fashion not only could be a factor of beauty but it also helps them to obtain the individuality and uniqueness in their community, at least in visual aspects.
	Many people are heavily influenced by the famous celebrities they like and try to dress like them. Teenagers sometimes follow the latest trends without any particular reason and sometimes to be different from others. Some people are in fashion industries and they try to present their unique identity by following the latest fashion design. Finally, television programmes and advertisement have a great influence on people and these people simply want to be more attractive by following the latest fashion.  
	Despite a diversity of superficial merits of excessive attention to fashion, it seems that its obvious disadvantages strongly draw societies’ care. For one, because of the fact that acquiring the latest fashion facilities entails a great deal of money, people are impelled to spend much of their budget for fulfilling their to look attractive. Furthermore, wasting time for thinking and searching in fashion world could be mentioned as another demerit of such time-consuming activities. By the way of illustration, one of the serious complications for parents is to tackle their children wasting time in shopping centres or surfing on the Internet pursuing the newest clothing etc. Fashion and latest trends are not restricted to hair style or costumes only. Piercing, tattooing, wearing bizarre materials are some other trends that often create social and family issues in many societies.   
	In brief, possessing elegant appearance and/or trying to be matched with the community could be some of the crucial elements of surfing in fashion-world and pursuing fashion excessively could lead to multitude impacts on individuals social and personal life alike in long-term.

Essay 245:
	Industries and businesses are the primary concern in many cities as they make the city more congested and pollute the environment in one hand, while creates job opportunities and contribute to the development of the city on the other hand. Many of the enterprises are operated and promoted in bigger cities only. Encouraging them to move to regional areas is a good idea. I believe that has more benefits than drawbacks.
	There are several advantages why industries should move to the regional areas and the government should take initiatives to do so. The most important aspect is the development of the regional areas. Setting up of the enterprises in the rural area will help to develop the basic infrastructures like transportation facility, electricity and road in the rural areas. In addition, the people of this area will have the golden opportunity of employment and that would enhance the living standard as well. Moreover, the economic activity of the area will increase and that would let the government take further initiatives in order to develop this urban area. The various types of small businesses and industries like hotel, lodge, suppliers will emerge and that will support other businesses and add value to the economy of these areas.
	Regional offices are often helpful to expand businesses and to reduce the manufacturing and operating cost. Thus many big industries would be actually benefited from this. Again the pressure on the big cities would reduce and that would lessen many serious issues like pollutions, traffic jam and waste management.
	Despite this, there are several disadvantages of moving the businesses and industries to regional areas. One of the prominent drawbacks is the exploitation of natural resources. The industry will use the various kind of resources such as forest, water resources which will cause the environmental degradation like pollution, climate change and much more. The gradual increase in the number of population in such urban areas will increase the crime rate. Finally relocating an industry to a different place involves a huge amount of costs and the industries would not want to spend this amount naturally.
	All in all, comparing the good look and bad look, I think that the government must encourage the selected industries and businesses to move to regional areas where they would operate in a better fashion for the overall betterment of economy and environment and population.

Essay 246:
	There is no doubt that some young students are encouraged to work or travel a year after finishing high school. Some people assume that such a step is so beneficial to students while others oppose such ideas. In my point of view, I think this idea has both advantages and disadvantages.
	An advantage of travelling or working just after high school and before attending university is the change to learning new things and gaining valuable work experience. When young people decide to work instead of getting straight to the university, they will get accustomed to the work environment and learn about several skills upon which they can build their future. In this way, it can be definitely assumed that they will be more than ready for any future work, be it a university study or any other job. For example, my brother preferred to work when he finished high school with the aim of learning new skills. Upon completion of high school, he easily found a suitable job and impressed the employers with his experience while also attending his university classes. 
	On the other hand, travelling or working instead of focusing on the university education has some negative impacts. When young people prefer to travel just after completing their high school, they may encounter cultural shocks. For example, one of my relatives decided to travel in young age and due to his immaturity and lack of knowledge of the outside world, he was utterly shocked by the customs and the way of life there. He was unable to get familiar with that community and was completely disappointed since he was unable to stay there. Consequently, his decision was against him because he did not get any benefit from his travelling.
	In conclusion, no one can deny that travelling or working during high school has its positive and negative impacts. So, high school students are highly recommended to know their abilities and readiness before embarking on working or travelling in order not to be shocked or otherwise.
Essay 247:
	In today's modern world, many students are planning to further their studies immediately after they finish school. However, there are a handful of people who assert that young teenagers should be given a chance to travel or work for at least one year before they really attend a university. Thus, it is important for us to establish both the positive and negative impacts on young people who plan to go on a trip or start to work before starting their tertiary education.
	Undoubtedly, there are numerous benefits if young people were to work or to travel around the world after they finish school. To begin, working or travelling helps the students to gain precious life experiences which are not available on textbooks. To illustrate, when young adults come out to work before attending a university, they are actually being offered a valuable opportunity to get into contact with others. It is crucial for them to develop interpersonal skills which play an indispensable role in their studies and their prospective jobs. In addition, if they were planned to go on a trip worldwide, they would, unquestionably, learn about the cultures and traditions of the locals which may be slightly or totally different from theirs. It, indirectly, widen their horizons and may help them to reduce the experience of culture shock when they arrive in a new place in the near future.
	Nevertheless, a coin always has another side. If they decide to work or to travel for a year, they may graduate later than their peers. The statistic of recent research conducted in Columbia has shown that memorising and interpreting abilities of a student deteriorate as they grow older. In other words, it means that they are likely highly not to achieve their aspirations due to the continual weakening of the mental abilities of their brains. Besides, they may have forgotten about the foundation of certain subjects that they have learnt in secondary school. Again, it will probably lead the students who start their tertiary education late fail to gain success in their academic performances.
	In conclusion, although there are both benefits and damaging consequences if they travel abroad or work after they finish school, I believe every individual can still strive hard and achieve their set goals regardless of life experience and age. Our nation will continue to prosper and flourish in the decades to come if more educated and knowledgeable generations are being raised up.

Essay 248:
	Nowadays, it is a unanimous notion that for some people that the legislation about marriage in terms of age should be at least 21.However, the others suppose that this rule is completely based on the fallacious opinion. In this essay, I will cite some arguments and give my stance on this issue.
	Firstly, the young who are going to marry should fathom the life painstakingly. Whilst the duration elapses the egregious plight and quandaries inculcate them to learn the new experiences in the mankind. For most people, in order to underpin this learning, the age limitation is one of the most paramount prerequisites. Because the person whose age is beneath 21 cannot adapt to the certain circumstances easily. Sometimes he will have to deal with tremendous problems and as an implication of it, he will abdicate his responsibilities. Subsequently, it can be rather perilous for his marriage in the future.
	On the other hand, everything is contingent upon the person himself and if he is trustworthy, nothing can cease him from attaining the authentic pinnacle of his marriage. In such condition, the responsibility plays a major role. In spite of the age difference, at times younger people’s marriage becomes happier than those who are older. Because of it, they are so ebullient and their love is rather strong in order to struggle with the difficulties. As a result, these features bring to the stupendous fruition about their marriage.
	Taking all things into account, it seems to me that the age is not a big problem for a happy marriage. The main issue is the dearth of love and responsibility that contribute to the augmenting divorce rate.

Essay 249:
	It is true that competition is a significant attitude in a workplace which is more prevalence between young and old employees. There are numerous reasons regarding this issue and various measures can be taken by governments to improve this situation.
	Higher unemployment proportion and the incursion of the innovative breakthrough are the major causes of increased competition amongst both young and old groups. Since people have faced economic recession in the world, the unemployment rate is rising they are more willing to maintain the job they have and youngsters compete with their  older counterparts to find a great job. At the same time, due to the advanced technology, employers find young generation more knowledgeable with higher qualifications. In this regard, youngsters are more likely to be recruited by them. However, the sense of competitiveness will arise at this point because older people believe that traditional and conventional methods are far more useful and never replaced with novel ones.
	Providing greater job possibilities and utilising both young and old people to train each other are the keys to solving this problem. It is governments' responsibility to invest in creating job opportunities and employ or maintain the elderly who are skilled and experienced so as to train younger counterparts. Besides, authorities can offer training courses for old workers in order to boost their technological knowledge. As a result, older people can benefit from the younger to learn modern technology usage at work.
	In conclusion, the competition among the young and the old workers will only be tackled if both groups help each other to improve their weaknesses and providing more job opportunities in the society.

Essay 250:
	Some people believe that developed countries should permit qualified job seekers who are from developing and underdeveloped countries, however, some others argue that it does not necessarily have to impose that discretion. This is not a trivial question to answer. Personally, I agree that there should be such permission for finding jobs from wealthy regions for workers who are originally from poor regions based on national cooperation in encountering poverty and mutual advantages point of views.
	To begin with, fighting poverty is an international responsibility, thus there should be some cooperative efforts between rich and poor regions. Since unemployment may be a major concern triggering poverty in destitute areas, one solution to overcome this problem is by creating a joint-partnership with rich countries that have to allow workers who meet the requirement of skills and knowledge to work. By applying this discretion, skilled employees from poor areas can be harnessed to run work effectively and they also may learn and gain experiences of how working in a progressive area and can bring back this experience to their origin for improvement.
	Furthermore, employing required and talented people from deprived regions can contribute to a mutual advantage between prosperous and poor cities. For successful cities, this idea can help increase their regional income as knowledgeable human resources are available to operate their factory and other occupation. Meanwhile, for deprived cities, it will help coping with poverty because skilled citizens can elevate their earnings to accomplish better life ahead.
	Nature of business and globalisation require rich nations to have talented individuals from different parts of the world to better understand the customer segments of other nations and to market their products and service properly. Organisation like Google, Microsoft and Samsung already have employees from different countries and other organisations in rich countries should follow this trend as well.  
	All in all, employing skilled and qualified workers from poor regions may be a form of national understanding in tackling poverty as well as sharing mutual benefit between rich and poor countries. Life will have a balance when everything is adequate, is not it?
Essay 251:
	In today’s modern world, although there are a number of countries who have become rich and more affluent by following the development and advancement of technology, there are still some nations who have remained poor. Therefore, some people assert that rich countries have an obligation to offer jobs to talented and wise workers who come from the poor countries, which I strongly agree with.
	There are several reasons which influence my view. To begin with, the act of allowing jobs for skilled and knowledgeable employees from poor countries by rich nations is considered to be an effective way to help the poor countries and it will indirectly strengthen the relationship among nations. It is important to ensure there will not be an occurrence of war between the nations which may have negative effects on the people’s lives, for example, it may even cost many innocent lives. By maintaining the close relationship between the countries by offering jobs for the employees from poor countries, the citizens in both nations can live in peace and serenity.
	The following factor that supports the idea of offering jobs to employees from poor countries by rich nations is that it could prove useful in helping the poor countries, especially the third world countries to reduce the cases of poverty. By offering jobs to the citizens from poor nations, they are able to support their family financially when they get back to their home countries. As proverb said, kill two birds with one stone, this action is believed to be beneficial to both sides, not only it will help the poor countries to tackle poverty and starvation problems, but also will help the rich nations to continue to prosper and flourish in the decades to come. This is mainly due to the reason that the talented and intelligent employees from poor countries can contribute endlessly to the rich countries.
	In conclusion, I strongly agree with the idea that rich countries should allow jobs for the employees from poor nations who are talented and intelligent owing to numerous factors. I believe the poor nations will soon become richer as long as the rich countries are willing to lend them a helping hand.
Essay 252:
	Some people believe that developed countries should open migration and work opportunities for skilled and educated people from third world countries, while others disagree with this opinion. The following essay will discuss the statement in details before stating my own opinion and drawing a rational conclusion.
	On the one hand, some experts think that developed countries should accept highly skilled people from underdeveloped countries. It is a fact that many developed countries such as Canada, Australia and New Zealand have a lacking of skilled workers and letting people come from underdeveloped countries to work in such countries would be beneficial for both parties. These developed countries have large natural resources but fewer population and hence they should welcome extra resources from other countries, especially poor countries who have a large population. Obviously, they need a lot of talented and educated people to boost their economic development, and one of the most effective ways is to open a migration path for skilled workers from third world countries.
	On the other hand, it is true that many developed countries have opened their doors to skilled immigrants these days. This fact has a cause a serious problem for many poor countries. Many of their knowledgeable and skilled people have migrated to advanced countries since they would get higher salaries, better benefits and safer political condition. As a result, these countries face difficulties in improving their economic conditions as they lack educated and skilled people. From a different perspective, the open immigration and work opportunity often increases the terrorism in first world countries which are evident from the recent world events.       
	In conclusion, to a certain point, I would agree with the migration policy of some rich countries which accept skilled people from developing countries. However, I also believe that the policy should also be limited to a certain quota, therefore not all of the best people from the poor countries leave their nations. It is obvious that the poor countries also need their best people to develop their countries.

Essay 253:
	At recent years, most of the people started to know the cultures of other countries. It is caused by many aspects such as the ongoing growing in international travel and the continuous improvement of variation of media. Inevitably, I believe that this phenomenon is a positive development for several considerations given below.
	To begin with, people in all parts of the world will easily get familiar with other countries' way of life. They will gain acknowledgements relating to the variety of cultures, common beliefs, kinds of religions, even mindsets so they can obtain more wisdom thinking not to judge others by wrong or right. Moreover, they will understand the geographical conditions and typical rules and laws which are applied as in depth processes of learning other civilisations so they attain a complete condition of surroundings in other parts of the world.
	To end with, the economy impacts are also undeniable. The flights industry will thrive, the tourism places will be favourable; the providers of a tour guide will be profitable because people are eager to know more about other cultures by staying close to the original places. As the result, local communities will achieve more income as direct effect and will be aware of social-economy purposes as well as the need for educational capacities (for example, learning foreign languages, mastering calculations of revenues, etc.) as indirectly long term impacts. As consequences, the governments together with city councils should pay more attentions to regulate and stay focus to this economy sector.
	To sum up, the advantages of knowing how other people live in other countries are inevitable so stakeholders are supposed to take responsibilities to maximise the result both social and economy benefits.

Essay 254:
	Colour has always played an important role in the human history and according to some recent research, it affects our consciousness and mood. I personally believe that a proper colour represents a good will and shows tenderness and this is why public buildings should have proper colour and decoration.
	To begin with, we are associated with different colours from the very beginning of our life. Parents and teachers teach us different colours and scientists believe that a child’s ability to classify different colours is connected with his calibre and talent. Thus our brains associate this colours with our moods and feelings. For instance, the red light on the streets sends an immediate alert to our brain to stop our vehicle while the green colour signals us to go ahead. Thus we are trained to react and feel differently with the association of colours. From this perspective, it is important to use soothing and accepted colours in places like schools, hospitals and offices.
	Furthermore, we tend to associate colours with different events from our personal experience. For this reasons, some people relate red with blood while white with peace. Universally blue is the colour of nature and fewer people would complain about it. Besides, people in some countries relate colours with certain moods. For example, more than one quarter Americans believe that the blue has something to do with comfort and cosiness while red represents violence. Due to the influence of colours in human psychology, all renowned food and beverage retailers have their own colour schemes.
	According to an article published on the Huffington Post, a combination of slate blue mixes with olive green and soft cream has helped to foster a team environment in many organisations. This also states that it has increased the team spirit and productivity of employees.
	To conclude, people’s wellbeing often depends on psychological condition and since colour has an acute influence on our mood, proper colour schemes should be used in our homes, offices, schools and public places.
Essay 255:
	Since the beginning of the civilisation, colour is a big part of human life. Different research and experiments have been done to find the effect of colours on people’s mood and psychology and the findings show that feelings of people can be influenced by colour. Hence, public buildings are suggested to use appropriate colour for decoration to motivate people to feel better. I agree that colour can affect our psychology and that is why offices and other public buildings should have appropriate colour and decorations.
	Firstly, a public health service should be located at a nice place, have a comfortable environment and appropriate decoration so that people feel better being there. It is important for the patients who stay there for quite a while or visit there for treatments. The top priority should be the better treatment facility and skilled doctors and then the colour scheme and decoration should be set in a way so that people feel better being there. Green and white could be two suitable colours for a hospital. Colour of the building and decoration matter and that’s why the restaurants and food selling brands have invested a lot of money to find the right colour to inspire people to eat and drink. Almost every renowned restaurant has its own branding and colour to attract people.  Proper colour can keep people calm and help them feel better and that’s why it is especially important for the hospitals and other health care centres to have the right colour and decoration. From my experience, I can say that I can wait more time in a room with soothing colour and decoration than in a messy room with very bright colour.  A particular colour can trigger our brain and arouse our feelings unconsciously.
	Similarly colour and interior decoration used in an office building can affect the mood and psychology of employees. Natural and eye-soothing colours are better for our physical and mental health and directly related to our stress level. Hence using the most appropriate colour in offices is also important. From my personal experience, I can say that I find light green, aqua and white colour very eye-soothing and I prefer to stay in a room decorated using these colours. Probably a very bright red colour would give me a headache as it is often related to anger, frustration and fire. Thus I believe that colours are directly and indirectly related to people’s work performance, mental state and health.
	To conclude, I stand to claim that colour has a big effect on human psychology in many ways. Thus, colour or decoration of a room should never be selected randomly. Rather a good amount of time should be invested to colour any building.

Essay 256:
	It is often stated that some people are born to be a leader. However, many people assume that a good leader may achieve leadership skill due to social interaction. Personally, I reckon to the second statement that to be a leader means to have the ability to understand some needs of the public and having proper behaviour and the leadership quality is achieved rather than to born with. 
	To begin with, the leadership qualities may trigger when there are crisis or opportunities in a community or a particular place which allows individuals to step forward and take some responsibilities. These characteristics occur to respond the social requests for overcoming some obstacles in that place. For example, when there is an election in a region, some individuals can register to be a leader, however, the only way to ensure the real figure is by giving matters to solve which may prove their leadership ability. Therefore, people who gain some input from society may have better qualities than people who have less interaction ability.
	Furthermore, it is believed that person in charge should respect one another. It means that they could manage and embrace people from various types. At the same time, the leader should treat others equally regardless their background and social status. Treating people equally might seem challenging in term of social satisfaction. However, if a leader can solve this issue, they will be known as a real leader.
	Some people are born with leadership quality as per many people’s opinion. But I believe that leadership is a quality which is related to someone’s personality, social influence, motivation and ambition. It is not unusual that we have so many great leaders in our history who simply responded to the need of time and stepped forward to help others. Leadership is a quality we must learn and feel passionate about.
	In conclusion, some qualities of leadership could not be achieved as a gift or destiny, yet it takes time and effort. Being friendly to society may become indispensable aspect to reach that goal since this opportunity provides people to engage deeply.

Essay 257:
	Stylish and branded dresses have significant demand among people in all over the world. While it is highly desirable due to its charm, I believe that outfits should be selected according to one’s necessity and comfort instead of the modern trend.
	From my point of view, there are few reasons for people to usually want to have new dresses even when they do not need them at all. One of the strong issues behind this is “impression”, which people think embarks by fancy dresses.  Sometimes it has considered as a first and foremost requirement to being up to date, confident and good looking. Apart from this, another indicator that insists people having stylish clothes is the fascination with their favourite celebrities and following their vogue blindly. Keeping up with the latest fashion and to be on trend are two factors people do to attract admirers in many cases. Undoubtedly, these are the factors that drive the world fashion industries and designer labels towards the supreme positions.
	Despite those reasons, we must admit, a basic need of our life like “cloth” should be purchased more smartly and wisely. Excessive shopping of dresses should be avoided because there are also many productive ways in our life where investing this money and time seem more sensible. For an instance: by cutting the extra budget of useless clothes, one can easily raise a fund for the purpose of entertainment, own a business or can run any kind of charity organisation. Furthermore, one should care about his or her appearance and the particular ambience while selecting a dress. Because it is the real definition of smartness that grabs more attention than modernised open up outfits. Following trendy fashions often contradicts with someone’s native culture and that can lead to social problems. Have a sense of style does not mean that someone has to wear the expensive and latest dresses always.
	In conclusion, while spending money, time and energy for having useless dresses just to show off and attract attentions, I believe utilisation of these elements in other creative areas and choosing comfortable clothes are far more reasonable.

Essay 258:
	Caregivers share the common ground when it comes to childcare activities. In this regard, showing the correct ropes for a growing child to become a shining star in life has been a monopoly for years. Giving weekly pocket money for their wards seem to be a helpful method to make them grow as more competent individuals, according to some parents. While this practice is being beneficial to a certain extent, I also believe it has its own drawbacks.
	Money given on a weekly basis to children could help them to become adept at financial management in future. This is because right from childhood they would know the value of money and what can be bought with how much cost. Besides, they would have also been exposed to situations wherein they have to save a fortnight’s money to get something essential. For example, a recent study on child’s attitude to finance, 2014, presents that, if Rs 50 is given per week to a child, the response would be planned expenditure in the fourth week in comparison with the first week. All in all, this change in perception of finance and its efficient planning would definitely help out in the future life of every child.
	On the flipside, the penny allotted for children at an early age could deteriorate their lives. There are high probabilities that they may be misled due to their acquaintance. Take for an instance, a child whose essentials are taken care by parents and does not want to spend money on anything, a companion of the child, in particular at the adolescent stage, might make him indulge in some anti- social activities like smoking or drinking. Therefore, until a child gets matured to become aware of the ins and outs of life, even a single penny given would drift away him or her from the path of life.
	In conclusion, though a grown-up man or woman takes some time to get on grips economically and attain a social status, it is all a part and parcel of life. In my opinion, the early stage of life, childhood should only be spent for having academic skills as well as pedagogic learning of basic expenses. But if the mother’s and father’s trust this method, the expenses are to be followed by them to borne fruitful results out of this.
Essay 259:
	It is common that many parents today offer nominal sums of money to their children weekly. Some people assert that this method of financial gifting would develop certain independent skills required for children in the long run. I personally agree that this would make children more capable and skilled in money management as they grow older for various reasons but would possess some dangers that cannot be ignored.
	To begin with, one of the major advantages of this practice is the accomplishment of the knowledge about money management in childhood. Moreover, it is a fact that childhood is the formative period of life. Therefore, if children are taught such skills, certainly that would strengthen their ability to confront with various skills and tribulations in the long run. Another merit of this act is that this money could be used for their personal needs especially in emergency situations. To cite an example, children can effectively manage incidences like the unexpected cancellation of the public transport and strikes and so on. Besides, the habit of saving can be cultivated and parents can keep them happy and satisfied and thereby strengthen the family bonds.
	On the other hand, it can be noticed that children are just agile and fun-loving in nature, who are not always physically and mentally matured enough to take informed decisions about money. These youngsters, who are tender-minded, could use this money for various purposes such as smoking, drug addiction and for amazing latest trendy gadgets. The result would be even more disastrous as it would surge the number of crimes in the society. To cite an example, many evil minded people could take it as a source of revenue by cheating and harming the vulnerable children for the money.
	In conclusion, I believe that though weekly allowance by parents to children has some positive sides, the negative aspect of this practice is much less rosy than many people think it is.
Essay 260:
	Nowadays, a growing number of people encourage parents to grant a small amount of pocket money weekly to their children. This is because they believe that giving weekly money to young children would enhance their financial management skills in future. However, some childcare organisations and guardians ask parents to avoid giving money to their juvenile. They claim that handing over money to their adolescents in early age might have deleterious impacts. However, I strongly assert that children have the right to receive a lump sum amount of money weekly so that they can readily fulfil their personal necessities and can learn better money management from an early stage of their life.  
	Firstly, it is intuitively obvious that teenagers who receive weekly pocket money from their parents can become experts in finance management in the future life. Additionally, they involve practically in financial matters and since they have limited amount they persist and strive in order to accomplish all their necessities without crossing financial boundaries. Alternatively, granting money to offspring on a weekly basis have other uncountable benefits such as they become familiar with the methodology of bargaining. Moreover, children who want to buy a specific toy or gadget for themselves start accumulating money in their fantastic treasure boxes. As a result, they can primarily go through the sophisticated process of saving money. Ultimately, it is extremely fundamental for parents to allocate a small budget weekly for their children because children's necessities are as mandatory as elder's. On top of this, the biggest demerit of not delivering pocket money to children is that they become a victim of inferiority complexity. Last but not the least, they often create social distances from their friends and family members.
	On the contrary, it is undoubtedly acknowledged that children who start possessing money in their younger ages can instantly involve in illegal activities and bad habits. For instance, drinking alcoholic beverages, taking drugs and smoking require money and children who have money can incline to these bad habits. There are ample evidence to suggest that children who receive extra cash for their necessities are highly likely to commit crimes and get involved in bad habits.  
	In conclusion, although offspring who do not grab a single penny from their parents are somewhat protected from getting into bad habits like smoking and alcoholic addictions, but in my opinion, parents should provide freedom to their kids in terms of purchasing their favourite and desired products and gadgets. As a result, they would probably become experts in purchasing, financial management, saving as well as bargaining.
Essay 261:
	Many people think that giving some money to children on a weekly basis will assist them in becoming more capable when they grow older. I personally disagree with the statement and the following essay will discuss some of my reasons for disagreement.  
	Firstly, by giving a small amount of money to children regularly we are not teaching them about being independent. It is a fact that children are learning many things from their parents in the early age and parents must do their best in becoming a good role model for them. By giving money to children routinely, these parents are teaching their children that they do not have to work hard or do something important to earn money. They will learn that someone will give them some money every week which they could spend on. For example, I can recall some of my cousins who regularly get a good amount of money from their parents and yet they have not build up any habit of being independent or any sense of saving money for the rainy days.      
	 Secondly, the money could be misused by the children as they could spend it for buying inappropriate stuff. It is undeniable that children are not yet mature and do not have the wisdom in managing their own money. They might purchase things which might be inappropriate for them, especially in third world countries where children are allowed to buy cigarettes or alcoholic beverages. Many teenagers, for example, get money from their parents and spend those for buying drugs or cigarettes which eventually harm their future rather than making any good.      
	In conclusion, some people believe giving children a small amount of money each week would help them in becoming more capable when they become adults. I do not agree with the statement as I believe that it could spoil them and the money could be misused. I agree if parents would teach children to earn some money by having a part-time job during the summer holiday, therefore they will appreciate their income and spend it wisely.

Essay 262:
	Our mother earth is weeping because of the two major threats, pollution and climate change. In spite of many global conferences being held to find out a permanent solution, a promising remedy is yet to be put into action. This essay will shed some light on the need to look for an effective plan and the alternatives that could put an end to these ever growing issues in the near future.
	There are several reasons to support the ineffectiveness of the solutions provided. Firstly, the more pragmatic the solution is the more it would be implemented and many decisions which are taken so far to combat the climate changes are less pragmatic. Take for an instance, putting up the usage of private vehicles tends to be something that can only exist on black and white. Secondly, measures taken so far seem like would be effective only in a long run. As a result, we still suffer the consequences of poor air quality, global warming and unpredictable climate. Finally, if only the rules enforced are stringent, is there a possibility for it to be implemented. The figures of authorities are usually less careful about the long-term effects of these global concerns on the future generation. Mitigation! That is what the world needs. The world leaders take decisions to fight the pollutions and climate change and many of these decisions remain in the papers and never see the daylight. The ideas should be implemented not discussed. The lack of implementation and budget are two main reasons we still have the pollution and increased Earth temperature.
	However, there are possibilities to make this planet clean and habitable again. For this to happen, sharing of vehicles among commuters of same destination or a reliable public transportation could be introduced. Besides, instead of focusing on long-term actions like reducing deforestation done for residential purposes, plantation of a large number of saplings and creation of awareness programmes for students would be much more operative. Furthermore, a hefty fine for non-environmental friendly activities ought to be followed to make the solutions efficient. The world leaders have to make things happen rather than discussion and decisions. They should enforce every country to implement the measures they think useful. Funnily, they decide to reduce the number of private vehicles on the roads and yet their countries produce millions of cars to export to other countries and they are investing more on space research than to make the world livable. That’s something that should be taken seriously not lightly.
	To bring the curtains down, the whys and wherefores of dissolutions that didn’t bear fruits were put in the limelight and also the immediate changes that can be done to hand down the globe as it is to the posterity were suggested.
Essay 263:
	It is undeniable that environmental issues such as global warming and pollution have negative impacts on all countries and these negative consequences would affect the whole world. Even though some global solutions have been addressed to solve these problems, many people believe that they were not effective and efficient. The following essay will discuss some of the reasons why the solutions were not successful and how these issues should be resolved.
	For a number of reasons, solutions that have been implemented for resolving environmental issues were considered as ineffective. Firstly, solutions were only implemented by certain countries. For example, only a few countries in the world implement carbon monoxide test for vehicles such as Canada or Australia while it should have been done in all countries. Other countries such as India and China are allowing vehicles with all conditions to commute in their streets and roads. Secondly, some countries do not provide clear regulations and laws regarding to environmental issues. For instance, in several countries, there is no fine or penalty when people throw the garbage to the river or sea. As a consequence, oceans are still polluted with waste from these countries. Though many global policies have been taken, many of them are not implemented in many countries. This is the main reason we still have increasing world temperature and pollutions.
	There are some solutions that the United Nations and governments could consider to resolve these environmental issues. One of the solutions is that it must be agreed and implemented by all countries. For example, Air Conditioners and Refrigerators must not use CFC gas which is dangerous for the ozone layers. These regulations must be implemented internationally, and for countries that still use CFC must be banned and given penalties. And then, each country should have strict regulations regarding to environmental issues and the United Nations should audit each of these countries on a timely manner. By having a review from an independent party, each country is forced to implement friendly environmental practices in their area.
	In conclusions, I believe that global environmental issues could be resolved, as long as all countries participate in implementing the solutions.

Essay 264:
	It is sometimes argued that more money should be spent on preventive measures than treatments, as they are of greater importance. However, I would argue that cure and prevention are equally important when it comes to spending money in these areas.
	There are several reasons why it can be argued that government should spend money on tackling the causes of diseases. Cost-effectiveness is the key element when placing more importance on these initiatives. By allowing people to have access to these health monitoring strategies, governments can avoid the hefty priced hospitalised treatments or other extravagantly expensive medicines. Take the modified gene coding as an example, the technique of relocating genes in the DNA of human beings can help deliberately avoiding inherited lethal illnesses in newborns such as diabetes. In this way, not only the financial pressure on health care departments can be reduced, but also the painful suffering caused by these contagious sicknesses. Hence, an improved quality of life for those who take these measures is a better alternative. So, if government prioritises preventative approaches as a mandatory element in tackling health problems, people would surely be leading healthy lives in a near future.
	In conclusion, governments have to make health reforms properly by investing equally in the cure and prevention of epidemic health illnesses in order to have better outcomes from health deprived people as well as ensuring a healthy and energetic living for them.

Essay 265:
	It is often argued that people should be charged in accordance with the amount of pollution they produce. While I accept that certain organisations should be penalised for this, I believe that every individual should not be forced to pay a fine.
	There are several reasons why the giant entrepreneurs should pay for contaminating the land. Having penalised with a specific amount of money factories will help the government to raise money which can be used in a variety of long-term and rationalised measures to mitigate the pollution from the earth. This will also deter them from producing more garbage and pollution. Take London as an example, where governments have invested recently a hefty amount of money in public transportation, in particular, local buses which have been designed to be much more efficient than the older ones. So these vehicles discharge fewer combustible pollutants into the air. Also, these self-centered companies sometimes exploit natural resources such as forests, water land and agricultural lands, beyond all their limits just to increase the profit. If these companies are not obliged to share the amount of money, which is required to curb pollutions, they will become more short-sighted (or greedy) in terms of making more money without even caring about the impact on climate change and environment.
	However, I would argue that every individual should not be liable to pay recommended fine. It is unrealistic that we can stop people from polluting the universe merely by imposing charges. Because people need electricity to enjoy technologies, a farmland to grow crops and an accommodation to live, food to eat as well as a mean of transportation to travel. Furthermore, if people from devastated backgrounds are charged more for the impact they have on climate; it will create an upheaval situation where lower-income groups would not be able to pay even for their daily necessities.
	In conclusion, organisations who are earning millions of pounds by exploiting natural resources should only be obliged to share the amount of money in curbing the pollution rather than all the common citizens.

Essay 266:
	People all around the world take into account the significance of genetic engineering. Although it is sometimes thought that it has numerous benefits to humanity, others are of the opinion that it could bring destruction to the ecosystem. However, my opinion on that issue is that both negative and positive effects of genetic engineering should be carefully researched and then should be used for the greater good of humanity.
	There are certain factors of the genetically engineering products. Firstly, crop modification will bring resistant to various plant diseases and it also targets infestation of unwanted insects. In other words, the amount of pesticides and fertiliser used are reduced. Furthermore, many countries are producing genetically engineered crops to produce a good variety of plants and abundant harvest. Genetic engineering can also address the increased food demands of people around the globe. Many diseases that human genetically inherits can be fought against with the improvement of genetic engineering and it can also ensure a generation.   
	However, some people argue that it brings long-term effects to humanity and environment. Certain reasons for these are the concerns of human health in which most modified foods contain toxins that are harmful to us. Also, it produces a minimal amount of nutrition. Another major concern is the potential harm to the environment- once genetically modified organisms are released into the wild, it interbreeds with the native organism and creates new species that may not be desirable.
	Finally, in my view, it is essential to look at the positive side it brings to humanity. As the population grows, the demand for food supply is increasing, thus, the natural method cannot cope the demand of the people. In this way, scientific way of plantation and farming are fundamental in our environment. Many diseases that cause death to a large number of people could be prevented using the blessing of genetic engineering.
	In conclusion, there are good arguments for and against genetic engineering, so people must continue to research various methods to minimise the negative side effects of engineering products to ensure the betterment of every individual in the future.

Essay 267:
	To begin with, ticket money for museum entrance discourages many students and low-income families to visit them. The collection of large museums increases day by day and thus people need to visit museums on a regular basis, not just once in a lifetime. When people need to spend money to witness history, many of them prefer going to movies instead. Furthermore, museums are mostly run by state funds and like public parks, sea beaches and libraries, they should be free of cost. The main reason museums get public funds is to convey the national history to the young people and to act as a national pride, not to earn from ticket money. From this regards, charging people for visiting museums have far more demerits than an ignorable advantage it offers.
	Proponents of museum entrance fee believe that the ticket money is necessary for its maintenance while they fail to realise that this cost could easily be covered by the tax payers’ money. Charging these people and their children again is unrealistic. Finally, free entry to the museum would attract more international visitors and spread the cultural uniqueness to the world and thus bring more tourists to a country. If there are charges, tourists would visit more popular places than the museums.
	To conclude, free entrance to museums have numerous long terms and immediate benefits that far outweigh the single monetary advantage ticket money system has.
Essay 268:
	Nowadays, many tourist attractions are present globally which are offered and promoted by the government and one of them is the museum. Museums also preserve and represent the history, traditions and many other important aspects of a country. In some museums, there is a policy that the visitors have to pay money before entering while others are free to visit. I certainly believe that the applied policy i.e. charging visitors for museum entrance derives more benefits than drawbacks.
	First and foremost, money collected from the visitors can be utilised to maintain and develop the museum. For instance, it can be used to cover the utility bills, repairing costs, renovation and staff costs. Maintaining a large museum costs a huge amount of money and the revenue earned from the visitors could be a good source of money to do that. Not all museums are funded by the government and sometimes museum‘s fund is not enough to cover all the costs it requires. If no money is taken from visitors, such museums would have to be shut down.  So admission fee in museums seems very utilitarian to maintain a better museum.
	Furthermore, due to applied tariff, inhabitants who enter a place providing scientific or historical values are likely to spend their leisure time there and do not enter unnecessarily. For example my sister, Lia tends to read carefully the available information provided in the museum and one of the reasons she does that because she wants to get some value from the money she spent. This example makes clear that admission money is seemly very utilitarian to encourage and educate the visitors to use facilities offered maximally.
	On the other hand, entrance fee in museums possibly reduce the guests because most of the people prefer to come to places and spend idle time that can be entered without any money. To illustrate, a garden located in the city gets more visitors than the other amusement parks which require a ticket to enter. The people in the garden go to walk, gossip and to chat with others which should not be the case in a museum. Only interested and real visitors in a museum would make it a better place for people to learn and visit.
	To conclude, although admission charge will attract fewer visitors in a museum in many cases, considering the purpose of a nice museum and to cover the expenses it requires, the entry fees seem to have more advantages than the drawbacks.
