Essay 1:
We can broadly categorise people into two main segments: the first segment of people are comfortable with living in the same place, eating the same types of food, having a career that involves pretty much doing the same thing and taking almost no risks, while others are completely the opposite who find the meaning of life through risks and challenges and are not afraid of trying new things. Personally, I like to take risks, face challenges and enjoy the diversity of the world through travelling and favour the second group of people.
People who avoid challenges or scarcely try new things are comfortable with the lifestyle they already have. They do not want to make life complicated by taking on new challenges that might bring misery or dissatisfaction to their life. Such people are often contended with whatever they have and wish to stay in their comfort zone. Since they are afraid of failure, their success is also limited. We can see many people around us who fall in this category, who, despite seeing potential in a new career, never dare to change their existing job or even detest the idea of trying new food.
On the other hand, there are people who believe that change is constant and that taking on challenges is something that makes life thrilling and enjoyable. They embrace new ideas, travel to difficult places, try new food, experience diversity of life and culture, and get easily bored doing the same thing for a long. These people take risks that bring success. But such success is not always guaranteed as failure can also befall them. I also know such people, and I consider myself one of them. They are often the trailblazer and inventors, builders and creators of new things and ideas. For instance, despite having a good job in a multinational company, one of my cousins started a boutique business. No one initially supported his move, but now he is so successful that many others cite him as an example of success.
In conclusion, being in the comfort zone, doing familiar things and taking minimal risks may guarantee comfort and stability in life but real success and great inventions and ideas come from taking risks and embracing challenges. I am always in favour of the second type of attitude that makes life worth living.
Essay 2:
Some people always yearn for new experiences in life and are never afraid to try new things. Others, on the contrary,  are happy doing the same thing and living in the same place all through their life primarily because they do not like changes. This essay will discuss both these attitudes. Personally, I believe that people who embrace changes and dare to try new things live life to the fullest.
People who try new things are often risk-takers and adventure seekers. They believe that life is a constant journey, and they often have an unquenchable thirst to visit as many places as they can, try as many dishes as they come across, take part in numerous adventurous activities and try different career paths in their life. Such people take risks in their personal and professional life. This is why they are either hugely successful or live a nomadic life. For instance, one of my university friends started travelling when all others were busy looking for a job. Due to this, he was struggling financially while others were stable in their jobs and earnings. However, after ten years of our graduation, this friend, who is also a famous travel blogger on YouTube and an investigative journalist, earns at least 10 times higher than any of us. This success is not always assured but comes to those who embrace non-traditional life and try new things.
On the other hand, many people are just happy doing the same thing over and over again and trying the things they are already familiar with. This approach involves fewer risks but often lacks big rewards and experience in life. Due to this mentality, many people are not interested in moving to a different city or trying a new career path despite their potential of doing something greater and bigger. Interestingly, many people who are afraid to take risks or try new things often claim to live a less complicated life. But I believe that this is not a way to live life to the fullest as it lacks adventure and never brings out our true potential in life. 
To conclude, doing the same things and living in the same place come with little risk, but lack adventure and tremendous rewards. Contrary to this, taking challenges and embracing new things come with enormous risks but the rewards are also huge.
Essay 3:
Attempting new activities and breaking habits, such as visiting new places, pursuing a new hobby, and trying new types of food, can be a thrilling and enriching experience for some people while quite daunting for others who prefer to stick with familiar activities and familiar choices. Both attitudes have their own benefits and demerits, and ultimately, it is a matter of personal preference. In this essay, I will be discussing both these attitudes, but personally, I prefer taking challenges and trying new things often.
Those who are not afraid of taking challenges and trying novel things can gain new experiences and enjoy rapid personal growth. They argue that experiencing new cultures, places, and foods, as well as pursuing new hobbies or tasks can broaden one's perspective and help one lead a more fulfilling life. I also have this mindset as I believe that trying new things can be an exciting and enriching experience. For example, I recently visited a new country for the first time and it was an amazing experience. I was able to learn about a new culture and try new foods that I had never had before. It was a truly enriching experience and I felt like I had grown as a person from it.
The second perspective is to maintain familiar activities and choices. People with this attitude feel comfortable and secure in sticking to what they already do and know. They believe that sticking to the familiar can lead to a sense of predictability and stability in life. I can see where they are coming from because there is definitely comfort in the familiar. For example, someone who always eats the same food and never tries new dishes may miss out on new experiences and flavours but also does not regret trying something that is so peculiar that it leaves a bad feeling the whole day.
To conclude, trying new things can lead to new understandings and personal growth while maintaining the accustomed routine can lead to a sense of predictability and stability. Since I love challenges and trying new things, I think it is good to try something new and break our habits for future growth and a fulfilling life.
Essay 5:
It is irrefutable that plastic harms the environment to a great extent. Plastic pollutes lands and water, degrades the fertility of the soil, and harms animals disrupting the entire ecosystem. Recycling plastic and limiting its use while also introducing biodegradable alternatives to plastics are by far the most effective solutions to this problem.
The environmental damages caused by plastic are severe and often extreme. Plastic bags, bottles, packages, toys and many other materials made of plastic remain in land and water for hundreds of years as they are not biodegradable. Plastic materials, that get mixed with soil, impair the breathability of soil and hamper the water flow in it. Thus it hurts the fertility of the land. Moreover, plastic that reaches the water bodies harms aquatic animals and coral reefs. Plastic pollution plays a considerable part in animal deaths. Today, plastic particles could be found in fishes, birds and other animals, and it disrupts the entire ecosystem.
However, the authorities concerned and mass people can turn the tide and mend the damage done to the environment to a great extent. For that, they have to ensure that they both play their part efficiently. First, people have to spontaneously take part in the plastic recycling process by putting plastic waste in a separate recycle bin. The authority has to make sure that all recyclable plastics are properly recycled and reused. To limit the use of plastic bags, people need to use bags made of biodegradable materials like jute fibre. They can start carrying their own glass-made bottle instead of buying plastic water bottles. Reduction in consumption of plastic-made materials could contribute to a large extent in limiting the harms caused by plastic. Finally, the government can limit the use of plastic bags and bottles by imposing a hefty tax on such items.
Plastic products are affordable, versatile and durable, but they are a threat to our environment. They pollute soil and water, endanger animals and act as a breeding ground for deadly insects. The authority and general people can take numerous measures to curb the problem and its magnitude.
Plastics can severely harm our environment. The littering of plastics creates a rather unhygienic condition here and there. These unsanitary conditions then become the breeding ground for harmful insects and mosquitoes, causing diseases like malaria and dengue. According to United Nations Environmental Programme, we produce nearly 400 million tons of plastic waste each year. Such a large volume of plastic waste can harm our environment to a large extent, especially, when these plastic products take from decades to centuries to decompose. They seriously degrade soil fertility or quality, meaning plants or trees can not grow well on those soils. Moreover, plastic items can seriously pollute water bodies too, by changing their original chemical property, since they easily can find their way into the rivers and oceans. And when that happens, it poses a grave threat to fish and other marine lives. There have been instances where some large endangered species of tortoises were found to be suffocating because of mistakenly swallowing plastic bags that were attached to seaweed.
To limit these environmental damages, governments and individuals, around the world, can take some effective initiatives. People can recycle some of the plastic products they use, and reduce their reliance on plastics. For instance, many people use glass-made bottles to carry water rather than using one-time-use plastic water bottles. But it definitely should be the governments that need to do the heavy lifting, in this case, to protect our environment from plastic waste by enacting different kinds of rules and regulations wherever deem appropriate and also continually running awareness programmes. For example, South Africa has restricted the manufacture and usage of plastic bags by enacting parliamentary legislation. Besides, governments can also offer tax incentives for those individuals or companies who do not use plastic products.
In conclusion, plastic is an imminent threat to our world, and if we - both the government and individuals - work hand in hand, then the chances are one day, we would be able to see a world where plastic is not a problem anymore.
Essay 6:
Plastic is used extensively because it is cheap and convenient, but it has severe environmental impacts. Plastic is not biodegradable, and the damage caused to the environment, especially to farmlands, oceans and marine life due to our love for plastic, is profound and should be stopped immediately. In this essay, I will outline the harms plastic causes to the environment and explore what could be done by governments and individuals to solve this problem.
The damages that plastic causes to the mother planet are significant and irreversible. Plastic bags, cutleries, bottles, and packaging are not biodegradable, and they take thousands of years to decompose. This means that once we discard plastic-made goods, they will remain in the environment for an extensive amount of time. It severely degrades the fertility of farming lands all around the world. Moreover, plastic that finds its way into the body of water or oceans can be particularly harmful, as it can entangle and suffocate animals living there. Plastic, that reaches the water, can also be ingested by animals and fishes there, causing injury or death to these species. According to the Natural Environment data, approximately a hundred thousand sea turtles and other marine animals die each year because they get entangled in plastic items.
To solve the problems caused by plastics, authorities and individuals need to take immediate action. First, governments, all around the world, can impose strict environmental laws, such as banning the use of plastic bags and promoting the use of biodegradable and renewable resources without delay. They can also impose hefty taxes on plastic products to discourage their use and manufacturing. Additionally, governments can organize numerous environmental awareness campaigns and programmes to educate the general public about the dangers of plastic and the benefits of using biodegradable and renewable alternatives.
The general public can also make a difference by reducing their use of plastic bags, bottles, and packaging which will have a huge positive impact in curbing the detrimental effects of plastics. They can do this by using reusable bags made of jute or clothes, glass bottles and containers, and by choosing to use products that have almost no packaging requirements. Additionally, mass people can support businesses that use sustainable packaging, which can help keep millions of tons of plastic materials out of landfills every year.
In conclusion, without a doubt, plastic is bad for the environment as it causes significant damage to our mother planet. We need to act now to stop the spread of plastic towards making a world free of plastic contamination and help the planet, especially ocean, retain its biodiversity. 
Essay 8:
With the rapid technological development, driverless vehicles are becoming a reality, and within a couple of decades, all cars will run without the intervention of a human driver. I personally believe that driverless cars will bring far more benefits than the possible drawbacks they have.
To begin with the drawbacks, driverless cars pose some risks, including accidents and casualties, should the technology malfunction. Since the vehicles would be run and controlled by software and technology, the risk of devastating accidents due to bugs or hacking could not be eliminated. It will make us more susceptible to hackers and software glitches. An accident, in which a woman died, caused by a driverless car while still in beta mode, caused a great uproar a few years ago. Moreover, not all roads, especially those in poor nations with ditches, holes and insufficient road signals, are suitable for those automated cars to run smoothly.
However, technology-made mistakes are astronomically fewer than man-made blunders when it comes to road safety and casualties, and this is where driverless automobiles can make a significant improvement. Though we point out a single accident made by a driverless car, human drivers are responsible for hundreds, if not thousands, of casualties each day all around the world. With the introduction of automated cars, accidents would reduce remarkably making roads safer for all. On top of that, millions of hours could be saved each day since we would no longer need to sit behind the wheel. It will increase our productivity and boost the national economy. 
In conclusion, driverless vehicles have many great benefits including road safety and economic benefits, and it is expected that we could eliminate the software related issues to reap the maximum benefits of this marvellous technology.
Essay 9:
Driverless cars, thanks to the phenomenal development of technology, are no longer fiction, but a reality, and it is expected that most vehicles will be autonomous in the future. Despite both benefits and demerits, the writer of this essay does think that the advantages of driverless vehicles do not outweigh the disadvantages. 
One of the major advantages of driverless vehicles is that they reduce the number of accidents on the road. Such cars provide better traffic efficiency since the driverless vehicles can travel efficiently at an optimized and safe distance from each other by communicating among themselves in real-time, on the road, and by telling which routes to take. It reduces accidents and casualties to a great extent.
However, the systems or the technologies, used to operate driverless vehicles, can malfunction or stop working at any time, without any prior notice. And, if that happens, an autonomous vehicle could actually put the passengers in more danger than if a human driver was driving it. Besides, self-driving cars lack the ability to make judgments among multiple unfavourable scenarios and outcomes. For example, let’s say that a self-driving car had to face a situation with only two possible options: one is to veer to the left and strike a pedestrian, and the other one is to turn to the right and hit a tree, potentially injuring the passengers inside the vehicle. Now, since both options are undesirable, which option would the driverless car choose? The Moral Machine, developed by a group at MIT in the USA, is seeking to address this critical issue by collecting data on real-life people’s decisions, but the data collected, so far, shows broad differences amongst different groups of people, making it very difficult to programme any definitive answer for autonomous cars. Thus autonomous cars are good to have but are not great to ride in!
The concept that all cars will be driverless has been gaining traction lately as advancements in technology have made it increasingly feasible and demonstrations have already been successful. The idea of a future where only passengers occupy such vehicles is one that has both benefits and drawbacks. However, in my opinion, the benefits of driverless vehicles outweigh the potential disadvantages.
One of the main drawbacks of driverless cars is the potential loss of jobs for millions of drivers. This is particularly concerning in industries, such as trucking, taxi service and ride-sharing, where driving is the primary occupation. Another major shortcoming of fully automated vehicles is the potential for hackers to gain control of the vehicle and cause mayhem. This could be a significant security concern, as the technology is still in its infancy, and vulnerabilities may not yet have been identified.
On the other hand, several major advantages of driverless vehicles make them an attractive option for the future. To begin with, driverless automobiles are expected to remarkably reduce the number of road accidents caused by human error, as the vehicles are controlled by advanced software and sensors that are less prone to mistakes. Additionally, automated vehicles have the potential to improve traffic flow and reduce congestion, as they can communicate with one another and adapt to changing traffic conditions in real-time. Furthermore, driverless vehicles could also have positive impacts on the environment as they will reduce fuel consumption and emissions, for example.
In conclusion, while there could be some disadvantages to the notion of driverless conveyances, the advantages of such vehicles far outweigh the drawbacks. The fewer road accidents, improved traffic conditions, and environmental benefits that driverless vehicles will bring us, make them an appealing choice for the future.
Essay 11:
Sugar is undoubtedly one of the most harmful food ingredients when consumed more than recommended potion - which is often the case in our daily diet. To reduce the sugar-rich food and drinks intake, many recommend making them more expensive, and I believe that such sugar-packed products should be expensive to promote public health.
Despite the common myth of the health benefits of sugar, scientists and nutritionists suggest that they are addictive, and are slow poison. Fast foods and sugary foods and drinks like soft drinks, desserts, ice-creams, and sodas come cheap and are ready to be consumed without any effort. This is why they have become so popular, and from children to the elderly, everyone loves those sugary foods and drinks. But these are known to cause serious diseases like diabetes and heart diseases and are connected to obesity. Since they are linked to so many unexpected health diseases and deaths, the authority should impose taxes, directly and indirectly, on those sugary items to make them unaffordable by mass people and in the process improve public health.
Moreover, people often opt for food and drinks that are cheap and easily available. And if we only look at the departmental stores around us, we can notice that we have sugary items all around us, and they are affordable. So to restrict sugar intake, their prices should be increased via direct and indirect taxes. If they are made more expensive, people will reduce their consumption and go for more healthy alternatives. For instance, if a healthy meal costs $5 while a sugary junk meal $10, most people will go for the cheaper and better option. It will gradually but surely improve public health and reduce medical care expenses both for the government and ordinary citizens.
To conclude, imposing higher taxes on sugary items will bring about many benefits and reduce the cost of healthcare. It is therefore expected that the authority will take steps to make sugar-packed items expensive.
Essay 12:
Sugary foods and drinks are detrimental to health, so many suggest increasing their price to dissuade many people from purchasing and intaking them. But, I will have to disagree with this opinion. This essay explains the reasons behind my opinion.
To begin with, even if the authority suddenly increases the prices of all sugary products, we will still notice that many people are still buying those products as usual. They will be buying them either because they are just too much “addicted” to those sugary products, or a high price does not really curtail their abilities to buy such expensive products. It will, however, negatively affect the prices of the necessary food items, and poor people will suffer to a great extent because it is not only “sugar” that is needed to make sugary products, but rather several other raw materials, such as flour, milk, egg, oil and etc. And that means that if the governments want to increase the price of sugary products, they will not only have to impose a higher tax exclusively on sugar but also on the other raw materials. 
Another problem with taking such a decision is that some manufacturers of these sugary products would still try to sell them illegally to their existing customers at a lower price, through some “back channels” or secretly, in order to keep their businesses, because a higher price of their products would almost inevitably push many of their regular customers away from buying their products. 
A far better solution to this problem would be to make people aware of the consequences of eating and drinking sugary items. When mass people are aware of the issues, they would spontaneously reject sugary items without creating any pressure on the market. 
In conclusion, we need to run awareness campaigns to inform people about the negative aspects of eating and drinking sugary items. When they are made aware, it will bring positive results while price hikes on sugary items would make things only worse.
Essay 13:
It is no secret that most processed foods and drinks contain excessive amounts of sugar, and this causes several health problems while also contributing to the growing obesity epidemic in many countries. In light of this, many argue that sugary products should be made more expensive in order to discourage consumption and encourage healthier alternatives. I completely agree with this viewpoint. 
One of the main reasons for the excessive consumption of sugary products and drinks is their low cost. Therefore, increasing the price of sugary products would be a proven method of reducing their overall consumption. A recent study conducted by the World Health Organization reveals that a 20% price increase in sugary drinks resulted in as much as a 15% decrease in their consumption in just six months. It is very logical that, when sugary products will be expensive, many people will be less likely to indulge in them as frequently, and will instead opt for healthier alternatives. This will be particularly beneficial for low-income individuals, who are disproportionately affected by obesity and related health problems due to their reliance on cheap, unhealthy food.
In addition, increasing the price of sugary products and imposing higher taxes on manufacturers of such products, can also serve as a deterrent for them to include excessive amounts of sugar in their products. This way, sellers will be incentivized to reduce the amount of sugar in their products in order to remain competitive in the market and make a profit.
In conclusion, increasing the cost of sugary products is an effective method of reducing sugar consumption and promoting healthier eating habits. It would not only discourage the excessive consumption of these products but also make healthier options more accessible and affordable for all.
Essay 14:
Processed food and most bottled drinks are packed with an excessive amount of sugar. Over-consumption of sugar is related to many deadly diseases and obesity, and this is why, many suggest that if those sugary products are made expensive, people, especially those with limited purchasing capacity, would consume less sugar and opt for healthy alternatives. I wholeheartedly disagree with this idea as I believe that this approach is not effective in curbing sugar intake.
It is somewhat true that many people, especially low-income groups, will not have sufficient means to buy sweet foods and drinks with high sugar levels when they are made expensive. Different research work suggests that when the authority increases the price of sugary products, mass people decrease their sugar intake proportionately.
However, people do not consume sugary products only because they are cheap. Rather, they love those sugary foods and drinks because they find them tasty, satisfying and addictive. This is perhaps the reason many people in my country enjoy a bottle of soda more than they would enjoy a glass of fresh juice without any sugar in it. Furthermore, increasing the price of sugary items may lead to a situation where low-income people would opt for even lower-quality options. I believe that raising the price of sweet items in the market does not address the root cause of the issue because for many individuals sweet products are integrated with their eating habits. Some eat them as rewards, others as a coping mechanism for stress and depression.
I believe that instead of raising the price of sugary products and imposing a heavy tax on the manufacturers, a more effective approach would be to educate people about the harm of excessive intake of sugar and sugary items. The school curriculum and social campaigns should emphasize how eating healthy can make our life positive in many perspectives. Promoting healthier food options in schools, office canteens and public places, for example, could be a far better approach. 
In conclusion, increasing the price of sugary food for the betterment of public health may seem like a great option on the surface, but it is not impactful. A more effective way would be to educate people and promote healthier food to combat the negative trends of consuming excessive sugary foods and drinks.
Essay 16:
Businesses often have to endure the cut-throat competition in order to attract customers and increase sales and profit. As a means to attract more customers, they have a tool called "advertisement" which emphasises how their products stand out from the crowd and how uniquely novel they are. I believe advertising new and unique features of a product is a marketing and branding strategy to boost sales, and in my opinion, it is mostly a negative development.
Every brand claims that they have the best product in the market, and their goods have fascinating new features. They do so to create a positive impression to the consumers to increase their sales and profitability while also staying ahead of their competitors. Take the advertisements that we watch on TV for consumer products like shampoo, soaps or body lotion - all of which proclaim that their products have the best ingredients and something new that their counterparts do not have. Even they beat their old versions by adding a new vitamin or flavour (which is often ridiculed by scientists) and claiming that this is the best ever product! Clearly, this is a marketing strategy to boost sales and profitability while also creating a craving among the consumers for their products.
It is mostly a negative trend because the new features that the businesses advertise are nothing novel in the true sense. They are just another version of the same product with a change in look, flavour or ingredients. It is true that industries like car manufacturers and electronic device manufacturers sometimes do extensive research to revamp their products and truly add new features for their customers. But most often consumer products and even the famous hardware brands add more creativity to their advertisements than the real products, thus making a false sense that people need their new products.
In conclusion, novelty and innovation in products come through research and development, not through marketing and advertising tricks - which is often the case in the adverts we are exposed to. It is expected that advertisements by brands would reflect the true features of goods rather than claiming something new and innovative every now and then.
Essay 17:
Brands often promote their products as innovative and novel. They primarily do so to attract more customers and increase their sales. In my opinion, any effort, on the part of businesses, to describe their products or services in a new light should be considered a positive thing because, without such practices, we would not be able to know about many of the necessary products and services that we use today. 
The obvious reason for this trend is that all businesses want to boost their sales and revenues. But, unfortunately, increasing sales and revenues is not always as easy as it may sound, especially, when they are operating in a very fiercely competitive market. And that is exactly why they need to employ innovative advertising ideas and business strategies to show their prospective customers that their products indeed are “something new” and offer better values for the prices they pay. 
Such “tactics” is also a positive development and indeed needed because it helps businesses and companies reach and attract a larger customer base from different lifestyles, cultural backgrounds, professions, ages, races and religions. In other words, we all are different, with different tastes and preferences, and therefore it is only natural that the businesses would want to target each group of these customers with different and unique messages in order to showcase and identify their products as something “new”. Moreover, such strategies employed by businesses bring positive results to many consumers because, the majority of the customers today, if not all, expect more out of their life. In other words, they do not necessarily like to remain satisfied with the same kinds of products that offer the same kind of “values”. The companies and manufacturers, of course, also know this too well except they are just not able to come up with different kinds of products every month, so to speak, to meet their customers’ demands. 
In conclusion, to keep customers on board and enhance sales businesses often advertise their products and services as innovative and new. It helps both customers to satisfy their more-than-life expectations as consumers while also bringing in more revenue to businesses. 
Essay 18:
Nowadays, most brands place significant emphasis on promoting their products as novel and innovative in their advertising campaigns. This trend is becoming increasingly prevalent, and one that many, including me, believe is a negative development.
Businesses choose to promote their products this way for many different reasons. First and foremost, new products are often seen as more exciting and appealing to consumers than older products. And when consumers find something appealing, they spend more money to purchase them. Additionally, promoting a product as new and innovative can help a product stand out in the marketplace, and ensure more profit for the business organisation. Perhaps, this is why we see so many variations of cosmetics in a single store, and many of them have been introduced very recently.
However, in my opinion, it is ultimately a negative trend. First, it can mislead consumers by giving false or fabricated information about a product. This is both unethical and deceitful. Second, The trend can lead to a cycle of constant consumption by many consumers, and after a while, dissuade them from buying products that they believe would be replaced by new products sooner or later. For instance, the demand for newly released Apple products is no longer so high among consumers as they know the brand is going to bring another improved version of the same products in a year or so. 
Furthermore, the constant emphasis on newness and advertisement campaigns to broadcast them to consumers can lead to a lack of innovation. When businesses are more focused on promoting their products as unique, rather than actually making them pristine, they may be less likely to invest in research and development to create truly innovative products. This can lead to a marketplace full of products that are only slightly different from one another, rather than truly unique and groundbreaking products. An example of this can be seen in the technology industry, where new smartphones are constantly being released with only small improvements over previous models, which can lead to consumer dissatisfaction.
In conclusion, most enterprises publicise their products as new and innovative, and it is a negative development since it can dupe customers and lead to customer dissatisfaction. Therefore, businesses must focus on creating truly new and innovative products, instead of just promoting them as such.
Essay 20:
Many citizens, nowadays, are inquisitive to learn about the home they live in as extensively as possible primarily because they want to learn about the background and style of their house, assess the safety, and find out if it is haunted. I believe nearby elderly citizens and the internet could be two invaluable sources for such curious people to find the best possible information about their buildings.
The knowledge of the background of a house gives people a sense of self-satisfaction. This is why people, especially those who live in a house that was built many years ago, are often interested to find out more about the adobe. The background often includes how the house was painstakingly built in an era when technology was not so advanced. Thus, exploring the background reveals some unique and fascinating facts. For instance, it was a common misconception for many dwellers in the old part of our city that their houses were built during the English colonial era. In fact, researchers recently found that those houses were built mimicking the English styles but by the local masons. It was fascinating to finally learn about it. Moreover, the construction and the built-quality of a house convey much information about the safety and durability of the houses. Knowing such details could prevent people from facing any disaster like falling victim to a collapsed house. Finally, some people superstitiously think a house might be haunted if it has some bad history. Learning about its history often comes from their personal belief and their motivation to either cleanse the house or move off. 
To get proper information about the houses, people can talk to local senior citizens who had been living there for quite a while. They can offer first-hand information about the building and much more details that are not available elsewhere. On top of that, the internet could be another effective source to get details of a house. For instance, many websites store data about the houses in the UK, and anyone can find them online with just a few mouse clicks.
In conclusion, people's motivations to learn about their houses could range from safety reasons to simple curiosity, from superstition to practical reasons. To get the best information they can contact elderly locals and browse the internet.
Essay 21:
The history of a house or a building can be fascinating, sometimes daunting or even mesmerising at times if we try to delve into it. For some people, learning about the history of the houses, in which they live, is utterly important for various reasons. This essay attempts to outline some of those possible reasons for this and a couple of methods to research this.
The first possible reason for many to become inquisitive about the past of their houses could be that they actually want to find a connection, if any, between themselves and the buildings. Such connections, or lack thereof, could actually provide an insight to them as to whether those buildings contained anything “unique” at some stages of their existence that would make them- the people that is – feel “special” among the others, or “different” from the rest of the crowds in their neighbourhoods. After all, I think that it feels really good to remain at the centre of attention every now and then.
Some people would be interested to learn about the history of their buildings, especially how they were built, or what kinds of materials were used to construct them because they want to make sure that the buildings are safe enough for living. After all, nobody would want to put their lives at risk by choosing to live in a “weak” building that was built with some “unreliable” materials about a century ago! 
But, for whatever reasons that they want to learn about the history of their buildings, it is always better that they ask the locals first to get their information about the former residents of their houses. They could also contact the local municipality or the concerned local authority who could apprise them about how the buildings were made. Finally, people could also visit a local library or the authority that keeps the information about old buildings, to learn about the history of buildings in their respective areas. 
To conclude, people are becoming more and more interested in the history of their houses primarily to find a unique feature of it to feel special or to learn about the architectural style and safety features of the house. They can contact local residents, municipality offices and the library to do the research work required to find the history of their houses.
Essay 23:
Some individuals support keeping pets around young children as they think it is beneficial while others oppose the idea citing pet-related injuries and fatalities in recent times. In this essay, I shall argue that dangers that stem from young children having pets are overemphasised, sometimes even exaggerated, and children receive substantive psychological benefits from having pets.
To commence with, most parents allow common and friendly pets like cats, dogs and birds as their children's companions and the number of strange pets like snakes, spiders, apes, etc. are very rare. Such unfamiliar pets, which are a bit wild in nature, have been reported to hurt some children. However, such incidents are so rare that they are negligible because the overwhelming majority of children have non-lethal pets like cats, dogs, fish, rodents and rabbits. For instance, recent statistical data reveals that 93% of children own non-lethal and friendly pets that have almost zero per cent chance of harming or hurting children. So, I believe that pets are not a physical danger to children.
To shed some light on the positivity of letting children have pets, I can think of many. However, the most important of them is the favourable effects it has on children's psychology and growth. Young pet owners frequently empathise with their pets and perform a diverse range of activities to maintain their well-being. The Cambridge Developmental Psychology Unit found that children who had grown up with pets were 30% less likely to bully others and show aggression. Pets are also conducive to young children's mental growth, and they get involved in interesting activities with their pets that help them realise empathy more deeply. So it is undeniable that a child’s prosociality and mental health can be improved through exposure to pets.
In conclusion, letting young children possess and interact with friendly pets has important benefits. It is not a threat to children, but rather beneficial to nurture some important good qualities in them. So, it is expected that parents who wish to have pets for their children would consider those benefits and finally select one of the friendly pets for their children. 
Essay 24:
While some people prefer to keep their children at a distance from pets because of health and safety reasons, others choose to do just the opposite. In this essay, I would like to argue that pets are actually good for the overall well-being of children for some obvious reasons.
The first reason, of course, is that pets provide the children with comfort and company, especially when nobody else is accompanying them. But, even when somebody is accompanying them, children still feel a sense of comfort in the company of their pets, mainly because those pets are usually more “passive” and “loyal” than other humans. And that is exactly probably why, as some researchers have found, a very significant percentage of parents allow their youngsters to have pets. 
Pets also help young children with learning. In fact, we often can see the children, who otherwise do not like to read, lying on their beds and reading to their dogs or cats and showing them pictures. The juniors even ask questions to their pets to see if they - the pets, are actually paying enough attention to the readings. In other words, the little ones actually learn important and fun things in a pleasant environment while petting their cats and dogs. Besides, researchers have also monitored that the stress level of the kids goes significantly down when they are with their pets. 
Finally, some researchers have also found that having pets can reduce a child’s risk of developing certain common allergies. Such research showed that children, who had animals, had fewer positive skin tests for indoor allergens - like a pet and dust-mite allergen, and also outdoor allergens such as ragweed and grass, compared to those juniors who did not live with pets. 
Essay 25:
The strength and prospect for the global media to shape the views of today’s youth and to educate them are significant. However, while some opine that the global media and international news, as part of education, have no important impact on secondary education, others believe that international news should be studied by those pupils to reap its benefits. This essay attempts to examine the issue by diving deep into it. I believe that international news as part of the secondary education syllabus is important.
On the one hand, global media enriches young people's understanding of contemporary affairs and enhances their views and perspectives. It is due to the fact that international affairs, as part of education, not only make them more conscious and knowledgeable but also connect global youths on the same platforms. For example, a study run by Oxford sociologists showed that the media heavily influences teenagers’ knowledge of contemporary affairs which has a highly positive impact on making them aware of the world. This awareness makes them global citizens and encourages them to share ideas.
On the contrary, many critics argue that teenagers would be negatively affected by the global media’s focus on negative issues of international events like wars and civil unrest if they are included in their education. This is because exposure to violence often leads to depression and the youths may grow an apathy towards our history and global politics. For example, recent surveys have discovered that despondent teenagers usually cite the dismal state of the world as a source of their depression. Since mental health is an important objective of secondary education, it is, therefore, questionable whether the study of international news would benefit young students.
In conclusion, it is clear that there are reasons for and against the study of news in secondary schools. However, educators and authorities can make it more useful by adopting proper policy and teaching methods, and reap the benefits of teaching young students international news as part of their academic education.
Essay 26:
International news can be a great source of knowledge and information from time to time, but that does not necessarily mean that it should formally be included in the secondary school curricula as one of the school subjects. In this essay, I will try to explain why I have taken such a stance on this issue. 
The primary reason is that most of the children from the secondary school level have rather tender minds and hearts, and as such, they will not actually be able to make sense of the many negative and controversial things that take place all over the world on a daily basis. After all, we do not live in an ideal world.  Besides, most news media today provide “biased” news which sometimes could not be any farther from truth, and these young children just do not have the required cultural, social, economic and political awareness to penetrate into the biased news, in order to separate the facts from fiction. So, instead of becoming more smart and knowledgeable about the world, in which they live, they will probably become more sad, prejudiced, and confused, if not hostile, about it should they be required to study international news as a school subject. 
Secondly, secondary school children already have to study many other challenging subjects, such as math, language, physics, chemistry, social science, history, and geography, and adding one more subject to that list would only create more pressure on those children. And with this extra pressure of study, those children would not most likely have enough time to play and socialise with their friends which are needed to ensure proper physical and mental growth. Finally, it is also possible that these teenage, restless children are getting distracted easily by many of the confusing, complicated and biased news every now and then, so much so that it would actually affect their studies rather negatively.
In conclusion, if we analyse these points, mentioned above, with an objective mind, we will have to agree that including international news as a school subject at a secondary level is not such a good idea, after all. 
Essay 28:
Fresh water, which is vital for the survival of humans and other flora and fauna, has always been a scarce natural resource on our planet, and this has been more acute in dried parts of the world. Due to rapid population growth and industrialisation, scarcity of this valuable resource has become a global issue. In this essay, I shall outline the main factors that have contributed to this problem and then elicit certain steps that can be taken to address this problem.
Regarding the reasons for the increasing demands for fresh water, population explosion is perhaps the most contributing factor. It is only natural that an inflated global population means more demand for freshwater - without which we can not live. Rapid industrialisation has also increased the demand for salt-free water. For instance, millions of cars are being produced every year, and a startling amount of fresh water is required in the process. Finally, urbanisation, human activities and industrialisation have polluted many natural fresh water reserves and have compounded the graveness of this issue.
As for the solutions to this intense and looming issue, strict legislation for preserving natural fresh water is required. No factories or industries should be allowed to carry on activities that poss threats to making freshwater sources polluted. Moreover, to reverse the already polluted reservoirs, the government should enact infrastructures for purification of them. More scientific experiments and research are required to convert seawater into saline-free water, which, I believe, will help in meeting the growing requirement of freshwater. Similarly, ordinary people can also contribute towards this noble cause by conserving water and also by limiting their daily household water usage. They should also refrain from performing activities that will pollute natural freshwater reserves.
In conclusion, fresh water is a limited resource without which we can not survive. This is why both the authorities and individuals should take every measure to save the already inadequate resource and find ways to purify seawater into freshwater. 
Essay 30:
Whether job applicants’ social skills are more important than their academic qualifications is a much-debated issue, and employers' opinions, regarding this, vary. I agree with the opinion that the social skills of candidates are more vital than their academic results, and in this essay, I will explain the reason for this belief.
The benefits of excellent social skills of a job seeker are apparent. Firstly, communication is the key to career success in modern days. This is primarily because the 21st century is best portrayed by constant interaction with different people, no matter the communication media - in person or online. Secondly, the ability to sell products or services is of paramount significance in any business – this requires strong social skills. For example, an employee with excellent social skills is able to have an impact in front of customers or clients; as a result, products or services can be perceived as high-value. Furthermore, employees with better social skills are generally more easy-going, which is very important to the workplace, including the employer. After all, as the saying goes, “who you work with is as important as what you do”, and an enjoyable work environment needs socially skilful employees. 
In contrast, some employers may claim that academic qualifications are a prerequisite for employment. Apparently, many positions require certain academic qualifications. However, in modern-day society, more and more employers have realised that whether employees can get the results that the business wants is the key to a business’s success. It can be seen that qualifications do not play a key role in this regard. 
In conclusion, I believe employees’ social skills are of extreme importance for a company or organisation. Also, I would suggest employers consider job applicants’ social skills first, which I believe would bring long-term benefits for the company and make a positive impact.
Essay 31:
The hiring managers are always on the hunt to recruit the best employees. But, should they put more emphasis on the social skills of job candidates than on their academic qualifications and other skills is open to discussion and debate. For me, the answer is “no”, and this essay will explain why.
We may wonder but can not exactly be sure why there is so much buzz about this “social skills” thing. For better or worse, the scope and benefits of a candidate's social skills - for instance, communication skills, flexibility and cooperation, positive mentality and so on - while ignoring other important qualifications are not exactly defined and accepted universally just as yet, except in some industries like “hospitality” and “healthcare”.  And that is exactly why we never really blame or question, for example, an accountant’s “social skills” level when he makes a mistake in preparing a “ledger” or “balance sheet”. Rather, we question or blame his or her commitment, experience, expertise or poor educational background.
Besides, it is still a common practice in the professional world that most employers today first ask about the academic qualifications of a prospective job candidate. And when that prospective candidate meets the minimum academic qualifications and/or experience requirements, then, and only then, the employers go to find out about the “social skills” level of that candidate. It is never the other way around. I found this to be specifically true in my case as well when I applied for several jobs in the past.
In conclusion, the social skills of a job seeker are important, but, such social skills are of very limited value unless they are supported by some good academic qualifications and other important skills.
Essay 33:
We have moved into a technology-driven era where technology is affecting many different aspects of our life, and education is no exception. So, in some schools, traditional methods of education have been revolutionised by new technology to the extent that the lecture is no longer the main method of teaching students. While this new approach has some advantages, it also has many significant shortcomings. This essay outlines both the advantages of disadvantages of this novel approach.
Perceivably the biggest advantage of the use of the latest technology in education is the flexibility it offers. This is evident in two different ways-  firstly, it is now no longer essential for students to be present in the classroom for their courses. The COVID-19 pandemic has specifically taught us how this flexibility could be a lifesaver. Moreover, the distance learning facility enables employed professionals, housewives and people from different countries to enrol and successfully finish useful courses offered by numerous institutes. Another area of flexibility is of course the interactive tools like "Moodles", for example, the lecturers can use to deliver their courses to large numbers of students.
Not everything, however, about the introduction of this new technology into education is useful. To start, not all students are comfortable with using technology, even if they are part of the digital native generation. This is a grave issue as they may suffer from their lack of technological skills and interests. For instance, an overwhelming number of students, almost 75%, despite their enthusiasm for smartphones and computers, reported that they do not like online classes. Another related issue is that education is a human activity, and it works best with as much human interaction as possible. Impersonal technology cannot replace the human contact found in traditional face-to-face tutorials and seminars. Thus a piece of technology or tool can never be an alternative to expert tutors who know their students individually and act and teach them accordingly.
To conclude, technology in education brings some important benefits and enables distance learning possible. It also becomes the only way of learning and teaching during lockdown and pandemics. However, due to the fact that it can be too impersonal for some and discourages others for their lack of technological skills or passion, it is still not the best method to teach and learn.
Essay 34:
Technology has touched every aspect of our life today, so much so that we can not think of living without it, even for a day. The world of “teaching and learning” is no exception, and this essay will try to explain what benefits and demerits incorporating technology in this field have brought.
Perhaps the most visible advantage of it is that it allows students to access more and varieties of information with just a few mouse clicks. Students, with the help of technology, can choose to research topics, and fill their interests and needs, much more easily than by going to a library where resources may be limited. And the best thing about it is that all this can be done in a group, freeing the teacher to attend to other individual students in more need. In other words, using technology in this way ensures that all the students get what they need, and also when they need it while allowing teachers to focus more on academically poor students.
Another advantage is that technology helps students accommodate multiple styles of learning. For example, some students respond better when communicated verbally rather than in written words. For such students, recorded lessons, audiobooks, and podcasts can effectively be woven into their lesson plans so that they can extract the benefits.
However, while technology has allowed both teachers and students alike to accomplish more, it is not without disadvantages. One such disadvantage is that it has significantly reduced the “face-to-face interaction” between students and teachers. This “face-to-face interaction” is very important because it helps students not just acquire facts, but also understand, interpret, and apply these facts into useful and interesting knowledge. More importantly, without such interaction, it is very highly unlikely that teachers would be able to help students build self-esteem and confidence and emotional maturity, especially, when there is so much bullying in and around the classrooms. 
To conclude, technology is a reality of our life today, and we just can not ignore it even if we want to. Therefore, we should be judicious in using it in the field of education and learning in order to extract maximum benefits.
Essay 36:
Some people affirm that students in male or female-only schools have better chances for academic achievements, whereas, many others point out that co-ed schools offer students better social skills for their future. This essay will discuss both these views, but the writer is in favour of a mixed-sex school.
Admittedly, single-sex schools have fewer distractions. This is because if a school has only boys or girls, students would not be distracted by members of the opposite sex at school; hence, they can focus on their learning. But, these students still have access to the other gender after school, which means, in reality, they must meet the other gender anyway. Consequently, single-sex schools do not guarantee better academic performance and results.
On the contrary, students studying at mixed schools have more chances to communicate with members of the opposite sex. In other words, children learn how to interact with the other gender at an early age; therefore, their social skills would certainly be fostered. Moreover, mixed schools give students opportunities to deal with conflicts with the other gender, which strengthens students’ problem-solving skills. For instance, when a boy has a conflict with a girl, both of them must learn how to cope. This lesson must be learned sooner or later; as a result, students benefit more if they can learn it sooner. Finally, mixed schools provide students with a real-life scenario where both genders co-exist. Specifically, students can learn in an organic environment in which boys and girls must know how to interact with each other.
In conclusion, I would concede that single-sex schools have some minor advantages. Despite that combined schools certainly support students better and prepare learners to become more socially adept. Overall, I am convinced that students should go to mixed schools for better professional, social and adult life.
Essay 37:
The debate over whether single-sex schooling is superior to a “co-educational” system has been rumbling on for decades. But, after analyzing the views and opinions from both sides in an objective manner, it would be fairly easy to conclude that the “single-sex” option is slightly better, and this essay will try to explain why that is the case.
It is true to some extent that the “co-ed” schooling system provides students with better social skills. After all, in such a system, boys and girls can learn to behave with each other from a very young age and grow together to be cooperative. Besides, the interaction between boys and girls isolates some of the “less desirable aspects” of both sexes.
On the contrary, a considerable advantage of single-sex education is that students in this educational system feel much more relaxed than their “co-ed” counterparts. Such relaxed feelings are cultivated in the absence of a “desire” to impress or attract the opposite sex. In other words, students in such an environment are more true to themselves and have the freedom to behave as they please, and as such, they are more willing to take risks since there is no fear of failing in front of the members of the opposite sex. As a result, the classrooms are more often dynamic, free, and bursting with ideas and conversation - all are hallmarks of a great education.  
Besides, many studies and research suggest that boys and girls tend to learn different things differently. For example, girls are usually ahead in reading, writing and spelling, while boys are ahead in mathematics. Boys need more intensive input in these areas of literacy, so only separating them would ensure that they are getting proper guidelines and lessons in these areas.
Essay 38:
The growing number of cars on the roads and reckless driving are the major causes of increasing road accidents these days. Therefore, many people, as well as some politicians, express their view that repetitive driving tests, and not just one test to get and renew the licence, should be in place. This essay outlines some advantages as well as disadvantages of the continuous testing process and opines that this has more benefits.
To start with the demerits of repeat driving tests, this process may unnecessarily impose a burden on people. This is because they will have to prepare for the test, pay for it, and allocate time for the test in order to renew the licence. As a result, many people may tend to avoid the tests, and one day, get pulled over and fined for an outdated licence. Moreover, it will cost money to the authority as well. Therefore, it may not solve the issue easily while both the drivers and the authority will be under pressure.
To outline the advantages, road safety in a country is a major concern and so is the obligation of legislators regarding this. Increasing vehicular movements and drivers' recklessness are two primary reasons for accidents on the roads. Drivers get outdated and more inept to new road rules and safety practices. For example, with age, many drivers may not see the traffic signals and road signs easily. As a result, such drivers may potentially hit other moving vehicles and people. Therefore, the repeat tests for driving, from time to time, will definitely improve the safety on roads. Moreover, many young drivers do not abide by the traffic rules, and continuous tests would ensure their awareness of safe driving. Finally, when people will have to take driving tests periodically, they will remain updated about traffic and safety rules.
In conclusion, reoccurring driving tests improve people's driving accuracy, make them aware of safety and laws, and find out potentially risky drivers. So the benefits of such tests surpass the drawbacks.
Essay 39:
Taking appropriate measures to stop road accidents is important due to their direct impact on the social environment, and forcing the drivers to take regular driving tests could possibly be one such measure. But, this measure has more disadvantages than advantages. This essay will outline the advantages and demerits of repeat driving tests, and try to explain the reasons why this had more drawbacks. 
No doubt repeat driving tests would eventually flush some, but not all, bad, crazy, and dangerous drivers out of the system. It would also probably put some “restrictions” on those drivers who can not drive properly anymore because of their old age or some debilitating illnesses. It is also possible that regular driving tests would alert or motivate some drivers to become more careful with their driving because of the fear that their driving licenses could be cancelled at any time. 
But, none of these advantages can be ensured or achieved without a high cost, as well as extra effort and time. After all, the state would need to employ additional resources, and thereby an additional budget as well, to take care of the additional driving examinations. In all probabilities, governments would then probably pass these additional costs or expenses on to the vehicle owners or drivers as extra taxes to cut government expenditures. These additional taxes would certainly weigh down heavily on these drivers and vehicle owners.
Now, even if these vehicle owners are ready to carry the burden of extra tax money and time, they would not necessarily be ready to remain under constant fear of being stripped of their driving privileges because of some “one-off” mistakes during the time of regular driving testing. Essentially, the same sentiment was echoed by a former director of AAA (American Automobile Association) of traffic safety advocacy and research who said that regular driving tests had been shown to reduce mobility by way of drivers voluntarily giving up their licenses due to fear of getting them taken away rather than any legitimate concerns about their driving.
To conclude, the disadvantages of regular driving tests would outweigh their advantages. This is why the authority should think wisely before taking such measures when it comes to repeat driving tests and road safety.
Essay 40:
The number of automobiles on roads is increasing rapidly these days which is aligned with the number of road accidents. Consequently, some opine that all driving licence holders must take a driving test periodically rather than taking it only once in their life. The following essay will discuss both the positive and negative sides of the repeat driving test. Personally, I believe that this process has more benefits than drawbacks.
It is undeniable that taking a repeat driving test would have some distinct disadvantages for people. One of the major drawbacks is the time and preparation it would require. In addition, people would have to pay every time to take the test. Finally, they also believe that it would cost more for the government as they must provide additional manpower, logistics and facilities in the driving test centres.
Despite all the negative aspects, performing a repeat driving test would have some significant benefits for everybody. Firstly, by having a repeat driving test, each driver would be updated with driving regulations. Secondly, drivers would be more cautious when they drive as their license will be checked regularly. Thirdly, it will reduce the number of traffic accidents because the driver's physical condition would also be examined as a part of the test. For example, each driver's eyesight would be examined as some drivers might have poor eyesight which may cause accidents. Thus repeat driving tests will drastically reduce road accidents.
In conclusion, conducting a driving test periodically has some drawbacks, but I do believe that it has more benefits for everybody. It is expected that regular driving tests will reduce the number of road accidents to a great extent.
Essay 42:
Global tourism is enjoying an upsurge in popularity nowadays. However, this trend is accompanied by many complaints that similarities of the landscapes considerably reduce the delights and attractions of the travel. Globalisation, in my mind, is the greatest reason for the similarities. I also think that it has more disadvantages than benefits.
No doubt, globalisation unifies the world in many different aspects. Girls in Shanghai can be witnessed to have the same street look as those in Paris and Milan; KFC and Pizza Hut are popular in Bangkok as they are back in California; the amazing film "2012" was premiered internationally at the same moment. Tourist attractions cannot escape from this sweeping trend. Therefore, it is quite normal to hear comments from a tourist in Hong Kong, claiming that what he or she has seen is just the same as in Tokyo.
This phenomenon, to me, is a depressing one. People may have sacrificed too many of their cultural identities for this. Culture is our ancestors' most treasurable heritage that is supposed to be passed on from generation to generation. It would be disastrous if people could only recall those busy shopping streets instead of the traditional lanes and houses after their trip to Vietnam. And I remember how frustrated I was when I found a lot of popular souvenirs in some foreign countries that could be bought back in Ho Chi Minh City — those delicate wooden sculptures really seemed far less appealing to me.
To conclude, since the trend of globalisation is inevitable, I suggest that both the government and the public make joint efforts in protecting and preserving their unique cultural features. Otherwise, global tourism would eventually turn to be boring and pointless.
Essay 43:
Our world has essentially become a global village, and it is only expected that things, including sceneries in different places, would look similar in one way or another. Contrary to many popular beliefs and suggestions, I think that these similarities carry more advantages than disadvantages, and this essay will explain why, as well as the reason behind such similarities.
Globalization is perhaps the single most contributing factor which makes cities look similar, makes western food common in distant Asian countries, and inspires Africans to wear dresses designed by European designers. For instance, the last time I travelled to Tokyo in Japan, a city that was supposed to be quite a contrast from London or New York, I could hardly believe that I was out of my homeland!
Of course, opponents to this trend would suggest that it has more disadvantages since they are not being able to see or experience anything “new” by investing their time and money. Some would also claim that in this way, they are losing the benefits of their unique cultural identities, and the privileges that are associated with them. But, if we look at the bigger picture, we will see that such similarities are actually bringing us closer to each other, by eliminating at least some of the misunderstandings among us, as well as some invisible, man-made, cultural “barriers”, we had, among each other. And when we have a sense of more “closeness” among us, we will try harder to cooperate with each other to eradicate poverty and suffering from our world, sooner rather than later. Here we can actually dare argue that if we had such “cooperation” among us in the past, we did not really need to deal with people like “Hitler” or “Genghis khan”.
In conclusion, we do not need some sceneries or popular landmarks to become symbols of “cultural and identity separation”, rather we want them to minimize the “difference” among us. And that is exactly what happens when we find places and sceneries to be similar to each other in different countries, even though its effects are not always visible and measurable.
Essay 45:
How children study and learn today, both at home and school, are radically different from the past, and the increased availability and relatively low price of modern technology have been instrumental in this change. However, I feel that while modern technologies, such as computers and the Internet, are important in assisting a child's learning, this learning should be guided and directed by the experience of human teachers.
Undeniably, computers and the Internet are extensively used in education, and they can present knowledge in a vivid and novel way. The computer and the Internet can also enable students to enhance their general understanding of how to solve difficulties in the study as well as giving them vital skills in readiness for later life. However, the problems are - the information that the computer can show has to be preprogrammed and needs constant updating. For example, the Internet may not be always a reliable source for knowledge, since there is often conflicting and fake information available when taken from unauthentic sources.
A traditional and long-established practice is for children to study and gain knowledge at school, learning skills in various ways taught by traditional methods by teachers. A school is a place where students gather to be educated and learn from each other, and taught by human educators. At school, for instance, students' development is orchestrated stage by stage, step by step by experienced teachers, and their acquisition of knowledge is guided and backed up systematically.
To conclude, I do not believe that it will help students to learn effectively and in an impressive manner to overemphasising the use of computers and the Internet. Rather, I feel that modern technologies can complement more traditional teaching and learning methods without being used as a replacement for these traditions.
Essay 47:
Young people’s approach toward hobbies is changing dramatically, and it is often influenced by technology and the modern world. At present, shopping as a favourite pastime activity is becoming extremely popular, especially among youngsters. Admittedly, shopping outlets' services, lucrative offers, rapid changes in technology, and digital advertisements are playing key roles in making this trend popular. However, unnecessary shopping is a waste of time and money, which, I believe, could be better utilised by youths.
The modern world we live in has many new technologies, gadgets, and fashion items, and they change so frequently that it is almost impossible to remain fashionable, trendy and updated without shopping regularly. Many people, especially youngsters, go shopping regularly because they feel those items are necessary for them. Since brands release new items quite often, the young generation goes shopping frequently. Digital advertisements by big and small brands also reach millions of youngsters and constantly lure them to get fashionable items to look and feel good, and sometimes their offers and discounts are quite good to be missed! For instance, renowned brands like Nike or some small brands often give up to 50% discount which drags many youngsters to their outlets.
Youths can use their leisure time in more productive activities and hobbies like going out and doing exercise, socialising with others, getting involved in charity works and taking part in different outdoor sports. These activities will keep them mentally and physically fit and make a far more healthy young generation without chronic diseases and obesity. Besides, they can invest time in reading, which will broaden their imagination and enhance their knowledge. For example, it is evident that students who like to read a lot do much better in exams and end up having a better career than those who hardly read books outside of their academic syllabus.
To conclude, I believe that shopping is important when it is restricted to buying necessary items. But if it becomes an obsession by young people, it is a problem. They should better spend the money and time doing things that would benefit them in the long run.
Essay 49:
Nowadays, environmental issues caused both by tourists and tourism-related activities have become so grave that many people insist on imposing hefty taxes on air travel and hotels for the sake of restricting the tourist inflow. I, however, disagree with this notion and believe that the authority should find better measures to address this rather than limiting the tourism industry with the burden of extra tax.
The key reason why I believe that governments ought to avoid levying more taxes on flights and accommodations is that tourism creates employment for local people and makes economic movements in the region. It also brings significant foreign remittance to the country. Many countries, St. Lucia, Maldives and Thailand, for example, heavily depend on the steady earnings of their tourism sector. It also makes people tolerant of different cultures and lets them learn about diverse cultures and traditions. If more taxes are imposed on the movement and accommodation of tourists, it would bring catastrophic results for many countries. Therefore, measures which would entail a decline in tourists should not be implemented.
To control pollution and excessive wastage, authorities can employ workers to clean their surroundings while instructing visitors not to pollute the environment. Policies to improve the manners of tourists should be implemented as well. Improving public buses and dedicating transport to foreign tourists can reduce traffic congestion to a great extent. Moreover, scientific research and engineering feats can reduce the pollution created by vehicles and aeroplanes, and money should be spent on such research works. These solutions would improve the situation on the one hand, and not deprive citizens of jobs and economic freedom on the other hand.
To conclude, extra levies on tourist transportation and accommodation will limit the inflow of tourists, putting local citizens' livelihoods at risk, especially in tourism-dependant countries. It is expected that the authorities would find better solutions that try to control pollution created by tourists’ actions in travel destinations instead of reducing their number.
Essay 50:
Tourism, no doubt, is important for many countries for several reasons, including its economic, social and cultural benefits. But, at the same time, we can not deny that tourism, if left unregulated, creates some problems, and governments should intervene to mitigate some of these issues by imposing extra taxes on flights and accommodation.
To begin with, tourism, one of the 10th largest industries in the world, is important for many countries. But, it becomes worrisome when it puts some undue pressure on natural resources through over-consumption, especially, in places where resources, infrastructure and facilities are already scarce. To reduce the overconsumption of resources, the government's initiatives to impose extra taxes could work like magic. Here we can specifically mention the small island countries, like Cyprus and Malta, which struggle to accommodate a large number of tourists. Hefty taxes seems like their only solution.
Not to mention, of course, the air and water pollution, among other negative effects, that are caused by the massive tourist transportation activities, both in air and sea, could also be controlled by imposing a travel tax. With more than a billion people travelling each year, the government needs regulations to keep the activity in check to minimise its negative effects. One way to effectively do that is to impose extra charges and taxes on accommodations and travel. Some European countries have already implemented policies to protect their tourist destinations, in quiet, non-offensive ways, by controlling the number of hotel beds, the number of flights to and from a country, and the number of tour buses allowed. No doubt, these are some good steps to control the flow of tourists, but they would yield even better results if these initiatives are supported by a tax increase on things like flights and hotel accommodation.
To conclude, tourism is important but too many tourists and their uncontrolled movement can have negative consequences. So the government should levy taxes on their accommodation and travel to keep a check on the number of tourists, and this can be a great step towards saving the tourist's destinations and the world.
Essay 52:
People use computers more extensively these days than ever before, and it is so widespread in our modern world that even children have access to these devices for playing games. This essay discusses the disadvantages of playing digital games on computer devices by youngsters and suggests some measures to reduce its negative effects.
Concerning the adverse impacts of young children playing video games, the most devastating one is the addiction these games create. Millions of dollars are spent to make computer games so that they attract a large number of audiences and keep them glued to the computer screens. So they are addictive by design. And this obsession hampers children's outdoor activities, studies and even time to socialise and learn important life skills. To illustrate, many research works suggest that children who spend many hours playing computer games each day end up performing poorly in schools and avoid social events and outdoor activities. It results in physical and psychological issues including poor eyesight and despair. Moreover, violent games cloud the youngsters' judgement and make their rational thinking unstable. Oftentimes, youngsters who play violent games develop violent behaviours. To cite an example, an unfortunate shooting event that claimed many innocent lives took place in an American school a few years ago was carried out by a teenager who was addicted to shooting games.
To minimise the severity of these negative impacts, parents must monitor what their children are doing, especially on computers. They should not be allowed to play computer games for more than a couple of hours each week, and parents can actively participate in those games with their children so that it becomes family time. An ideal example of it could be my aunt and uncle who play video games with their children, and as a result, children are also interested in doing outdoor activities with them. Finally, parents can use parental control over the digital content and games their children watch or play. These measures would deter children from downloading and playing games that are not suitable for their age.
Essay 53:
Technology has revolutionised the way audiences watch movies these days. With the internet, smartphones and tablets, we can now watch movies anywhere and anytime. Some people believe that this is a substitute for going to the cinema. Personally, I think that movie theatres deliver an unparalleled experience as not all movies can be enjoyed on small screens.
On the one hand, the advent of smart devices has put the cinema business at stake as it has redefined how people can watch a movie. Recently, many people have begun relying on their smartphones to watch their favourite videos and movies at their convenience. For example, many mobile applications, such as Netflix, provide users access to millions of contents at an affordable price, including those that are not shown in theatres. This has given people a good reason to enjoy movies with their family at home. It would be costly and inconvenient if people had to watch those movies in the cinema.
On the other hand, theatres give an unmatched experience that viewers can not get while watching movies on a small hand-held screen. For example, in movie theatres, films are projected on a large screen with a high-quality surrounding sound system and a comfortable seat, where spectators can enjoy the film to its fullest. In addition, many cinema providers have recently introduced new theatre concepts to cater to various customer segments and included a wide range of cuisines in their dine-in options. If cinemas cease to exist, movie-lovers would be deprived of such an immersive experience. Moreover, watching movies in a theatre is more than enjoying a movie, it is a great way of socialising. To give an example, whenever I watch a movie with my friends, it is more enjoyable due to the social interaction and enjoyment it offers.
In conclusion, despite the convenience the smart devices provide for movie-watchers, I strongly believe that theatres still remain an important option, especially for movie-goers, who prefer experience over convenience.
Essay 55:
Nowadays, the ratio of employed people who suffer from different health-related issues is increasing faster than ever and their general health condition is deteriorating. Such a cataclysm has stemmed from work pressure, lack of physical exercise and dependency on machines to do our work. Exercise, encouragement from the employer and the government to do workouts, and finally, a balanced diet are the solutions to this problem.
One of the primary reasons for working people not to do enough or any exercise is the abysmal working condition where working life is extremely competitive and full of anxiety. For instance, employers have constant deadlines and tough targets at their offices, and to achieve them, they have to work for long hours each day. It drains their stamina, and as a consequence, they do not want to do any exercise even when they are at home. In addition, dependency on technology has deteriorated the condition. Due to technological advancements, people have exchanged the available time for exercise with browsing the internet, watching television and checking their accounts on social media websites. They also prefer to drive than to walk, and use washing machines to clean their clothes - just to give some examples. This trend, in turn, has negative impacts on their health.
To address this problem, physical exercise is a "must". To remain fit, those workers have to stop leading a sedentary lifestyle and start moving. The government can facilitate outdoor activities so that people get out and take part in those activities after office hours. Employers have to realise that healthy employees mean better productivity and they should arrange exercise facilities at the office premises. To give an example of how sports and exercise facilities can encourage employees to do some workout, we can take offices near the parks and gyms as an example. It is evident that employees in those offices are practically more inclined to do exercise than those who are located in areas where public parks and exercise facilities are rare. Finally, the workers have to follow a balanced diet to achieve a better result, and the office can help them with that too.
In conclusion, exercise is essential to our health, productivity and life. In consequence, workers, authorities, employers, and individuals should collaborate to make everyone's lifestyle healthier by adding more time for exercise and helping follow a balanced diet.
Essay 57:
Music plays a crucial role in our lives and eliminates differences among various cultures and generations. It symbolises harmony and reflects humanity. So, I agree with the notion that music helps bring people from various cultures and generations together.
One of the reasons music excretes the barriers among different nations and cultures is that people enjoy music from every part of the world, and it speaks the same language, which embodies human emotion, joy, love and sorrow. Music does not need interpretation to be enjoyed and understood as it touches our hearts and resonates in our minds. No matter what language we speak or understand, we appreciate the melody and depth of music which is why people of all ages can sit together and enjoy the same music. For instance, some viral music in foreign languages in our country signifies how it speaks our minds and hearts rather than just a human language.
Moreover, nations influence each other with the type of music they produce and the type of musical instruments they use. This amalgamation reduces cultural differences and brings people from different cultures and ages to a common platform. To cite an example, many music genres, that we enjoy these days, were derived from multiple nations and cultures and people from all these cultures enjoy and love them.
Finally, music is an art form which is enjoyed by all, and this helps reduce the generation and age gaps among people. To illustrate, when the national anthem is played, children, adults and elders all tune to the same emotion, which is patriotism, and their unity is stronger than ever. The same can be said when music evokes other emotions like love, sadness and so on. Besides, some music categories are loved by all, and the listeners feel a sense of togetherness in a divine way which is almost absent in other art forms. It not only eliminates age gaps but also the generation and cultural gaps.
Music can stimulate our minds and bodies and also offer some temporary relief from mental agony and sadness. Music probably can do many other things, but it can not bring people of different cultures and ages together. And this essay will explain why we can not rely on music to accomplish such a difficult task.
Music has some elements and qualities to bring some like-minded people within, not outside of a certain culture, country or nation closer together in a common bond because the tone and tune of that music sound so familiar to them. Many music lovers even suggest that music is the food for our soul, regardless of our ages. True that may be, but when we are pinning our hopes on music to unite people of different cultures and ages, we are becoming too much optimistic, to say the least, because culture is a very difficult subject to understand and so is “human nature”.
Culture is not only about what we like to listen to, or what we do not for some temporary pleasure or gratification.  Rather, culture, among other things, very predominantly is also about “how we are so dissimilar to each other”, and it is essentially this “wish” or “sentiment” that helps us cling to our own ways of life, no matter how “peculiar” or “weird” that may look to other cultures. It is because of this strong “sentiment” that even though, almost all the countries in the continent of South America essentially speak the same language or practice the same religion, they are not merged into only one country. The same applies to different ages as well, and that is why we see, more often than not, that while a young guy likes some heavy rock or heavy metal music, an older person likes a more traditional or classic type of music.
Essay 58:
The tremendous expansion of the metropolises and the worsening environment in such areas are major dilemmas in the contemporary world. Our classic towns and villages, with gardens and playgrounds, have turned into ugly concrete jungles, and that has led to a deterioration in people's living standards. This has primarily happened due to the mass migration to cities for better careers and amenities. The establishment of pristine societies and self-reliant suburban systems can improve the situation dramatically.
This urban sprawl could be attributed to two primary reasons. First, the migration of skilled and unskilled workers from rural to modernized societies, seeking better jobs and higher quality of life, has accelerated it. It is evident that tens of thousands of people move to cities each year where they think they will have better careers and earnings. Secondly, city-centric education, healthcare, and other amenities have tempted people to move to cities. Take my grandfather as an example who moved to our capital city approximately 45 years ago with the hope that he would ensure better education for his children. This colossal movement of population to metro areas has increased the cost of living while declining the living standard.
The government needs to find effective solutions to check the mass migration of people to cities, and also prevent the deterioration of these municipalities and people's living standards there. Firstly, the construction of pristine societies where environmental standards can rival what used to be in our cities in retrospect could be a great initiative. Then, the authority can encourage people to live in towns and rural areas by providing important facilities, such as health coverage, free education, and child benefits. For instance, if people in suburban areas are offered health insurance and education for free, they would not plan to move to cities where treatments and child education are generally much more expensive. Moreover, the development of the suburban area to create more jobs is also essential without compromising its green nature. This could be achieved by constructing more schools, offices, and business centres while also setting higher minimum wages in these areas.
In conclusion, the explosion of population in municipalities kills our future and hope. So we - the government, civil societies and individuals, must tackle this crisis before it aggravates beyond our control.
Essay 59:
Rapid developments in megacities and mass migration of population to these metropolitans with the hope of better life, career and future have ushered in a perplexing conundrum that leads to a worsening life standard, crowd and pollution in such big cities. City-centric development, better-earning prospects and amenities in large cities have primarily stimulated the development of this situation. The government needs to decentralise and focus on the development of suburban and rural areas to reverse the scenario. 
Most megacities develop faster than any other part of the country and attract millions of people who migrate from other areas. This situation stems from the fact that the authority enables city-centric growth which makes the big cities the hub for business, trade, manufacturing, education, research, employment and so on. This city-centric development forces people to move to big cities to add more woes to the already deteriorating situation there. A large factory, for example, in a city can hire thousands of people, and most of these employees come there for a better career. Moreover, most universities, colleges, hospitals, offices and other amenities are located in the heart of the large cities, and people move there to access those facilities. A recent statistic points out that more than 80 thousand students move to our capital city each year to get enrolled in different college and university courses. 
To solve the ever-increasing population burden and pollution in metropolitan areas, the government has to move out many offices, colleges, factories and so on to remote areas. Without relocating those, the expectation of reducing pollution and crowd in big cities is far-fetched and impractical. For instance, at least 2.5 million factory workers live in our capital city who can not afford proper accommodation, sanitary bathrooms and clean drinking water. Diseases can spread faster there than anywhere else and could risk the whole city in the process. To move those people to suburban or rural areas, the government has to decentralise. Moreover, the development focus should not be only city-centric. It should rather be properly distributed. This will make sure people have jobs in rural areas and are not forced to move to a large city.
In conclusion, the phenomenal growth of cities poses different problems and increases pollution, and traffic congestion, and decreases living standards. Decentralisation and rural area-centric development can reverse the situation to a great extent.      
Essay 61:
Stress slays us from the inside and can lead to personal, social, physical and psychological issues that drive us to the verge of dilapidation. Stress and anxiety are far more severe and widespread among the modern generation than in their forefathers. The reasons for this crisis could be attributed to poor working conditions and the worldwide financial crisis. Several initiatives could be taken to address this problem.
One of the primary reasons for the extensive stress-related problems in the modern era is the demanding and highly competitive work environment. Constant work pressure, deadlines, and job insecurity lead to lengthier office hours, which leave little or no family or personal time. It disrupts our relationships, social life, and sleep pattern, and fosters unhealthy diet habits and sedentary lifestyles. For instance, with the ever-increasing working hours, employees sleep fewer hours than ever before, and the majority of them do not cook healthy meals at home. The final result is a more stressful life and deteriorating health conditions.
Another reason for this horrendous problem is the global economic crisis and rampant inflation. As a result, many people find it extremely difficult to meet their expenses and often get trapped in loans and debts. Bankruptcy is increasing, and more people are trying to get a second job to support their lifestyle than ever before. The result is more depression and distress, which even leads to suicides.
As a solution to this social catastrophe, governments should enact laws to restrict working hours and push employers to improve the working environment for their employees. In addition, financial aid to needy people and mentorship and therapy programmes for already sufferers are needed. Finally and most importantly, we, as individuals, have to be more prudent in our lifestyle choice, expenses, savings and retirement plans, and spend quality time with our family to eliminate stress and tension. To give an example, even after having a busy professional life, people who choose to lead a healthy life often tend to suffer less from depression, anxiety and stress. So our choices matter.
In conclusion, stress is a silent killer and impedes our performance, deteriorates our health and destroys our relationships. It is expected that individuals and governments will work hard to make a stress-free modern world for all.
Essay 62:
"Stress" is a curse in our modern-day world, and it is the reason for some serious health concerns today, compared to our forefather's generation. In this essay, I shall discuss what causes stress, and how to deal with it.
Stress and stress-related problems are so common today around the world because we constantly expect way too much out of our life than what our parents and grandparents used to expect. As a result of this, we try to do too many things, at once, thinking that those things will make us feel happier and better. But, of course, we are only human, and we just can not do so many things, without putting a huge burden and strain on us!
Apart from this “expecting too much out of our life” thing, issues like finance, family and relationship problem, and work-related pressure also cause people to stress in one way or another. But, out of all these matters, financial issues seem to top the list. In fact, according to a recent survey, the majority of the study participants reported money being a significant source of stress, with 77% feeling considerable anxiety about finances. It is accelerated by our imprudent spending habits and rampant inflations.
But, whatever may cause this menace called “stress” among us, the end result is that it is causing some serious health concerns for many of us, and that is why we need to get rid of it. And to do so, we all first need to keep in mind that we just can not have it all in our life, no matter how hard we try. We also need to communicate our problems with our families and the people around us, as frequently as we can, so that we do not feel overburdened with our problems. Finally, we also need to have some time for ourselves so that we can do some physical exercise because physical exercise can also ease pressure on our minds and help us get rid of stress.
In conclusion, stress is a widespread problem and is primarily caused by our have-it-all expectations and financial problems. To overcome it, we need to be realistic about our expectations, spend prudently, communicate our issues with others, and do some physical activities regularly.
Essay 64:
Adolescents face several challenges on their path to adulthood and successful career. And it becomes even more difficult for school-leavers as sorting their ways out in the employment market seems to be the immediate obstacle they encounter. Besides, other social and family issues often hurt them, and this essay shed some light on the topic.
Regarding the problems fresh school graduates face, the most acute is the scepticism harboured by employers over hiring them. It seems to be the reason behind the high unemployment rates in many countries, especially in third-world countries where managing a job by a school leaver is exceptionally difficult. Employers usually look for experienced workers who possess practical skills and at least a college degree. Hence, school graduates with no prior experience are often placed at the bottom of the shortlist. For instance, due to unemployment, many university graduates apply for simple clerical jobs, which makes the scenario for school-leavers even more baffling.
Moreover, limited job prospect is another big problem for them. Even the school-leavers are lucky enough to secure a job, they have to work long hours with low wages. They often do not have sufficient time and money to pursue higher academic qualifications needed for career progression. Consequently, they are trapped in lower positions with limited social mobility.
Sadly, young people are not only challenged by employment problems. They may consistently live under the threat of political instability, social unrest, sexual and racial discrimination, and child marriage - all of which are beyond their control. These risks pose actual threats to the physical safety of youngsters in addition to their livelihoods.
To conclude, unemployment is one of the major problems for young people, especially for school-leavers. However, the lack of safety, social unrest, and discriminations are also serious problems for them in parts of the world.
Essay 65:
Unemployment is a significant challenge in many parts of the world today, but it is not the biggest challenge to school-leavers in most countries. So, I disagree with the idea of the essay. Here, I will also outline other serious challenges that are faced by young people today. 
School-leavers are young people who are generally very optimistic and enthusiastic about joining the professional world, but they are also generally very inexperienced at the same time about the realities of life as well as the professional world. In many cases, these school-leavers do not also have the necessary skills, aptitude and acumen, needed to enter or compete in the job market. But, once these school-leavers receive some proper training and experience, related to the available jobs, getting a job suddenly does not remain such a big challenge anymore. 
A far bigger challenge for high school graduates is the dilemma to decide whether to take a year break or continue education, do a part-time job or take a skill development course, stay with the family or live alone, get into a relationship or focus on the future career and so on. Those decisions are crucial for their future and are quite challenging for young minds. For instance, more than 68% of school-leavers in our capital city find making the right decision far more challenging than getting a part-time job. Finally, staying away from bad companies and bad habits seems like another challenge that young people find really hard. Some bad companies can ruin the life of a school graduate without him or her even realising it. So this is extremely challenging. 
In conclusion, unemployment is a big challenge, but not the biggest challenge for school-leavers. Deciding on important directions in life and staying away from bad friends and bad habits are much more challenging for them.
Essay 66:
The unemployment rate among youngsters who have recently finished school is a major concern in many countries. In my view, finding the first job is a herculean task, and the most challenging perhaps, for such youngsters just after their school graduation. As a result, many of them remain unemployed. So I agree with the opinion offered.
To begin with, the modern job pool is extremely competitive. Employers are looking for candidates with a renowned diploma as well as considerable experience. Thus, just a school certificate and some training courses cannot guarantee employment for adolescents in most countries. This is why unemployment is still the biggest problem that fresh school graduates have to face. To illustrate, more than 66% of school-leavers in many subcontinent regions remain unemployed because they are not eligible to apply for better jobs and due to the lack of suitable jobs for them in the job market.
Besides unemployment, school-leavers often face family pressure and money insufficiency that they cannot avoid. According to the research conducted by the Bureau of Statistics, one of the major social issues for fresh school leavers is the expectations from their family to support them, especially in needy families. The research reveals that such youngsters were ready to work extra hours or find a not-so-suitable part-time job just to support their families. But getting a decent job was tremendously challenging.
In conclusion, youngsters face several difficulties after they complete school education, such as family pressure and the shortage of money. However, the most challenging task for them, in my opinion, is finding their first stable job.
Essay 68:
Sound health plays an indispensable role in our life and work performance. That is why many employers seek ways to offer perks, such as gyms or sports clubs sponsorship, with a belief that healthier and happier employees will become more productive at work while many other employers simply do not invest in it. The essay will examine both sides, but I personally believe that various other motivations and rewards, in combination with this initiative, will bring effective results.
The proponent of gyms or sports club subsidies offered by employers believes that physical and mental wellness is a prerequisite for optimal work performance. It is evident that sportive people are less likely to get sick, take fewer sick leaves and hence bring the least disruptions to daily operations in their workplace. Furthermore, sport is a good way to build team spirit and promote interpersonal skills. Thus the harmonious professional relationship that results from workers hitting the gyms or playing sports will certainly facilitate work efficacy. Moreover, sports club sponsorship by companies will implicitly convey the message that employers care about the wellness of their employees. Perhaps, employees will pay extra effort at work if they are valued. For instance, some of my friends speak highly of their employers because they feel their office authority takes care of their well-being by offering the facility to hit the gym.
Conversely, the opponent of gyms or sports facility funding says that companies should focus on incentives that really matter to employees instead, namely job prospects, pay increments, job satisfaction, training opportunities, reasonable workloads and holidays. If employees’ performances are directly linked to their pay increments or career progression, they should have enough tangible rewards to work effectively. Likewise, if workers are able to identify meaningful goals or get job satisfaction, they should have intrinsic motivation to excel at work. To give an example, studies show that employees work more dedicatedly when they are motivated and are awarded rather than having facilities like gyms.
In conclusion, I believe that gyms or sports clubs membership offered by the office is one of many effective motivations for some employees to work efficiently at work. But for many others, monetary or other tangible or intangible rewards are more useful. It is expected that employers will provide a range of extrinsic and intrinsic motivators that will promote productivity at work.
Essay 69:
These days, some employers think that a healthier crew of staff means more productivity and more revenue for their business while others think that it brings no benefit to them. In this essay, I will discuss both views, but personally, I am in favour of the former view.
On an average, workers may spend up to three-quarters of their day sitting down on their desks to get their job done as best and fast as they can except, of course, they do not know that such “marathon attachment to their desks and chairs” can contribute to a range of preventable health conditions, like back injuries and stress, depression or anxiety. Now, this information alone should be enough of a reason for the employers to motivate their employees to get involved with some sort of physical or gym activities. But, in case, if it does not, then they should consider that according to a UK government report on May 8, 2018, published by its “Department for digital, culture, media & sports, in the year 2017, just over 1.3 million workers suffered from work-related ill-health, which equated to 25.7 million working days lost.
Of course, those, who do not care much about the health of their employees, suggest that health and fitness can not be spoon-fed. They are correct to some extent because our lifestyle is often a choice that we make. They also argue that if someone does not take any initiative on his or her own to improve his or her health, then the chances are that the initiatives on the part of a company would not also really make much of a difference.
In conclusion, the opponents of promoting better health for employees may have a point or two, but that does not necessarily mean that employers should not try to take some sort of initiative to make their employees healthier. And the sooner, the employers take such initiatives, the better will it fare for their businesses.
Essay 71:
The covid-19 pandemic has shattered the world to its core, and ongoing wars in different regions have brought us to the verge of a large-scale war more devastating than any time in human history. Thus the world is facing numerous challenges on top of its regular problems like global warming, overpopulation and poverty. My country, I believe, will face economic challenges and the possibility to get involved in a war in the next ten years.
The global economy has been hit hard by the ongoing pandemic, restrictions, wars, and recessions. My country, in particular, relies on imports more heavily than its exports. As a result, the foreign currency reserve may shrink in the future, making it more difficult to import necessary fuels and goods from other countries. It will surely have negative consequences on our economy. Moreover, our job market is likely to become more unstable due to the challenges faced by the businesses. Besides, the world is watching appalling and devastating wars, and many countries, including ours, have a possibility to get involved in a war in the next few years. If this happens, the fate of our country is bleak.
To address the upcoming economic problems of our country, the authority has to take diverse initiatives to strengthen our export industries. They can offer incentives to export-oriented companies, for example, to achieve that. They should also take measures to increase our foreign reserves so that we do not get trapped in a situation where we will fail to import necessary foods and medicines for the lack of foreign currency. One way to achieve that is to restrict the amount someone from our country can spend on a foreign tour from now on. To avoid wars and regional conflicts, our leaders have to take part in friendly discussions with their counterparts instead of their hot rhetorics. We must understand that it is not a time to get involved in a war when millions of people are suffering from the ongoing pandemic and recession.  
Essay 72:
Governments, environmentalists and large organisations, in many countries, are trying to curb environmental problems, and a part of this effort is to make people aware of environmental issues. It is surprising how our dietary habits or even the dresses we wear can all contribute to environmental problems. So, without involving ordinary citizens, government bodies and private organisations can not reverse the downward fall when it comes to the environment.
To commence with, without creating awareness among ordinary citizens, it is impossible to achieve environmental protection. We, as ordinary citizens, are constantly contributing to global warming, pollution and climate change. To illustrate, the cars we drive exhaust carbon dioxide, the dresses we wear require a large amount of fibres and water, the plastic bags we use end up in the water, and even the diets we follow can impact the climate. Thus, if people are not cognizant of their actions that are directly or indirectly responsible for global warming, they will not fully comprehend the gravity of the intricacies and feel responsible. Climate change is so big a problem that only governments and large organizations can not work to find a solution, and a coordinated effort is required.
It is undeniable that countries have taken serious steps to curb environmental problems, and our leaders meet frequently to discuss it. Restrictions are in place on gas emissions, fossil fuel use, plastic production and use, and alternative sources of green energy are being invested upon. But if the efforts are not made at an individual level, the magnitude of damage and pollution would far outstrip the efforts. To cite an example, scientists, engineers, environmentalists and the authority may come out with proposals and invest money in research, but they can not control the amount of plastic bags we use and throw away without recycling. Every environmental problem is related to our human lifestyle and unconsciousness, so it is high time to include the syllabus about environmental protection in our school. We have got only one planet to live on, and we must save it.
In conclusion, whatever we do to the environment will return and affect us. So all levels of education should emphasize how we can be more responsible in protecting it. A joint approach by the authority and mass people can only make it happen.
Essay 73:
Nowadays, environmental issues have become bigger and more crucial than at any time in the past. Some believe that authorities, large firms and manufacturers can play a fundamental role in reversing the detrimental damages done to the environment while ordinary people have little to contribute. From my perspective, although the government and large companies must take immediate actions to save the earth, people have an important role to play.
The earth is confronting devastating threats, and it is imperative to take some radical moves by the authorities immediately. For example, authorities should dedicate a large amount of budget to improve the public transport infrastructures and enact strict regulations and laws regarding usage or ownership of private vehicles. They generate a considerable volume of greenhouse gases, which are considered the main culprit behind global warming. Moreover, it should be compulsory for companies to be based on renewable resources of energy for their productions. Also, they should limit their productions to the proportion of demand because mass production not only threatens the natural resources but is also primarily responsible for endless rubbish and harmful pollutants that overwhelmingly harm nature.
In addition to the actions required by the government and organisations, people need to be active in saving the mother planet. Little choices they make can have a big impact. To cite an instance, the way we dispose of our household waste can make a difference. If we separate the biodegradable and non-biodegradable garbage from the origin, from homes, it will effectively reduce the recycling strain, which is profoundly time, money, and energy-consuming. Furthermore, the more they become aware of the environment and understand how crucial it is to protect it, the more sustainable and healthier the world becomes.
In conclusion, governments and large companies must initiate immediate and radical actions for the sake of the earth's survival, and people still can play a significant role in diverse aspects of the earth's well-being.
Essay 74:
Every country in the world is suffering from some sort of environmental crisis, which is exacerbating each year. In my view, individual effort is less significant in reducing such damages; hence, the government, international organisations and big corporations should come forward to tackle this ever-increasing global warming and environmental issues.
Environmental damage is an intricate issue that primarily results from careless industrialisation. Most factories release chemicals into the environment without any treatment and emit CO2. So, they are liable for such devastating environmental degradation, and they should pay all the money to reinstate the environment. To give an example, according to the World Economic Forum, industrial wastes are the key reason for the contemporary ecological collapse, and it comprises 70% of the world’s pollutions. Since industries are primarily responsible for global warming, they should be made liable to invest to reverse it.
Moreover, pollution is wreaking havoc in all countries. As countries are inextricably connected, they can not deny their duties to resolve the issue. When the iceberg in Antarctica melts, it increases the risks of floods in the lower sea-level countries like Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and the Maldives. Interestingly, 80% of global warming is happening due to excessive fuel usages in developed countries. So rich countries should reduce their fuel consumption to limit the global temperature rise so that other countries become free from any environment-related jeopardies. Governments, international organisations and large corporations have the means and capacity to tackle it internationally, and ordinary people can do little to enact international laws or take effective initiatives to reverse the damage done.
In conclusion, the intensity of the environmental damages has reached its peak, so individual efforts cannot change it significantly. In fact, large organizations and governments should resolve the issue because they are responsible for most of the damages, and they have the means to control it.
Essay 75:
Humans have been degrading the earth ever since we realised our capability to harness nature. As a result, we are facing environmental issues that have gone beyond our control. Despite coordinated efforts by environmentalists and governments, the downward spiral has hardly been reversed. And, environmental problems are not only the liability of the government and big organisations, but it is also everyone’s duty to protect, nurture and care for the mother earth.
To begin with, problems associated with the environment today are getting worse, and the earth is being polluted not only because of large industries or factories but also because of us - ordinary people. Every action we, as ordinary citizens, take also has an impact on our environment. For example, the use of plastic is a common cause of environmental contamination and no matter how many times the government bans the use of plastic, the havoc it causes to the environment will not stop unless mass people stop using it. We have to realise how significant it is to protect our environment, and deciding to carry bags made from fibres or biodegradable materials could be an initial step.
Moreover, the government can not decide to stop industrialisation as that would severely hamper a country's GDP. On top of that, large corporations are mostly after their business profit rather than caring for the environment. So if we rely on such organisations to reverse the damage caused to nature, we would only be imprudent in the long run. We need to step forward and vow to save the only planet we have for us and our future generation. For instance, large organisations or the local authority can plant trees to a certain extent, and it will not have a drastic impact unless and until people start planting trees in their spare space and on the rooftop.
To conclude, considering the increase in overall environmental damages in recent years, the earth will become inhabitable soon. To save our planet and the human race from becoming extinct, we all should join our hands together and work towards the common goal of reducing the damage to our environment.
Essay 77:
Fossil fuel, though extensively used, is not eco-friendly, and its usage comes with huge environmental costs. Considering global warming and climate change, and the detrimental effects fossil fuels have on the environment and public health, green fuel, such as solar, hydro and wind power, could be the answer to our future energy demand. It is a good thing that many countries have already started using these green power sources.
The demand for fuels is rapidly increasing in many countries with the population rise. It is also associated with industrialisation, and it seems only obvious that oil, coal and natural gas-rich countries would largely use them to take the leverage of their stock of such energy sources. For instance, Russia has natural gas, China and India are rich in coal, and the USA and OPEC countries have a huge stockpile of oil. Besides, other developed countries that do not have a huge stock of such fuel, import them from other countries at a considerably cheap price. However, the stock of fossil fuel is limited and would get exhausted at a certain point. So, alternative and green sources, which is renewable, would be the main source of our energy in the future, and we should get ready for the time when we will have no new oil or gas stock. Since green energy like wind and solar energy is renewable, their use should be as much encouraged as possible from right now, and it is a good thing that the trend has already started.
Alternative sources of power, such as solar and wind power, do not pollute the environment, have lower carbon emissions and are eco-friendly. So their use could save the planet from the disaster of global warming which is already visible around us. Wind power and solar power are in use in countries like Denmark, Germany and France, and more and more countries are joining the list. We already have an extremely efficient technology to produce solar and wind power, and the trend is quite encouraging.
To conclude, the energy demand is increasing at a fast pace, and the stock of fossil fuels is diminishing. So we should turn to alternative green energy sources and share the technology and expertise with all nations so that the transition happens all around the world to save our otherwise dying planet due to climate change and greenhouse effects.
Essay 78:
Every year the energy demand is increasing globally. So the strains on the current and already limited resources are high, and most of these energy resources, like fossil fuels, harm our environment one way or another. So I wholeheartedly believe that the use of alternative sources of energy is a positive trend, and their use should be encouraged further.
To solve the global energy demand and environmental problems, we need answers to questions like how to better use the existing, limited fossil fuel resources, and how we can encourage the use of alternative energy sources. Fossil fuels, like coal and oil, are not an unlimited source of energy. Some countries are rich in oil deposits like OPEC, whereas others have coal deposits or natural gas. And a few others, Germany and Japan, for example, are completely dependent on the import of such resources. For all these countries, alternative energy, also known as green energy, should be encouraged and utilised to reduce the dependence on fossil fuels as well as to keep the global environment in balance and ‘healthy’. The trend of producing green energy is thus a timely initiative to save our planet from climate change and global warming.
To turn the situation in our favour, we have to introduce clean energy supplies that would not harm the environment and would be feasible for most countries to produce. Wind power and solar power are at present seem to be the perfect alternatives for that. Countries like France and Norway, among others, have the advanced technology needed to produce extremely efficient solar panels to store energy from the sun or produce win power. Both kinds of power can reduce a country’s dependence on fossil fuels, so their use is, no doubt, a very positive trend.
In conclusion, the use of solar and wind power to produce energy does not pollute the environment and in turn, helps keep the ecosystem stable. So they should be treated positively, and their mass use encouraged.
Essay 79:
These days, the environment is being severely affected by the excessive use of nonrenewable energy resources, such as petrol, diesel, coal and natural gas. However, eco-friendly and renewable power sources like wind and solar power are being adopted in many countries, and I wholeheartedly think that it is a positive trend.
To begin with, many nations have already made a firm decision to regain the balance of our planet. To achieve that, they have made significant modifications to their system. Firstly, the implementation of windmills and hydroelectric plants is gaining popularity at a rapid pace. This is a secure way of generating electricity that saves the environment and money and leads the way to a future when clean energy will be predominant in the world. For instance, Croatia is setting an example for its neighbouring countries by generating seventy per cent of its energy from solar power. It is a very positive development that other countries can follow to make the world green again.
Additionally, the major advantage of utilising these alternative resources is that they greatly reduce the carbon content of the environment and make the planet more sustainable. Moreover, it is cheaper to produce such clean energy than to extract coal or natural gas which makes these eco-friendly energies affordable to mass people. A recent study by Oxford University reveals that the production of solar power is 30% cheaper than that of fossil fuel. This finding again emphasizes how important it is for all nations to opt for renewable energy sources, and how beneficial it is that many countries have already invested in generating clean power.
In conclusion, even though we have harmed Mother Nature to a great extent by indiscriminately using fossil fuels, some countries have already shown us a better way to produce and use power. It is expected that more countries will invest in alternative sources of energy to make the planet green again and make energy affordable for all.
Essay 81:
Personal cars have become an essential part of our life due to a variety of benefits it offers including easy access to different facilities and services, safety, freedom to travel, and comfort of the journey. However, these advantages come with a cost, and among them, environmental degradation and traffic congestion are two major concerns. We can improve the public transportation system and gradually increase fuel prices to discourage people from using private cars while also investing in eco-friendly cars.
Problems associated with increasing car use are huge, and its environmental impacts are a great concern for many.  Automobiles are a big source of carbon dioxide emission and greenhouse effects and not to mention, air and sound pollutions in urban areas all around the world. Vehicle exhausts contribute to global warming, acid rain and many health-related problems. Climate change is already affecting millions of people's lives and hurting the ecological balance, and it is terrifying to think about what the ever-increasing vehicles on the roads would do to our planet in the future unless we do something to reverse it. Moreover, personal cars are the reason we face horrendous traffic jam almost every day which kills our valuable time and negatively affect our productivity.
To address these problems, some people suggest that the government should impose strict restrictions on car ownership and increase the tax on car purchasing to a staggering height. However, the mobility and flexibility of personal cars are essential in our life, and I am absolutely against taking any drastic measures. Rather, we should improve our public transportation facility to a great extent so that people prefer to use public buses and trains rather than driving. Another measure could be slowly increasing the fuel price that would deter many people from using and driving cars. Moreover, car manufacturers should invest in environment-friendly solar or hydrogen-powered cars to reduce the negative impacts of cars on the environment and the government should improve the roads to reduce traffic congestion.
In conclusion, restricting the use of cars overnight might seem like a quick and effective solution, but practically speaking, it is not a proper solution. We want to use cars for the freedom of our mobility but have to come with eco-friendly cars to reduce their negative impacts.
Essay 83:
Access to the internet is easy in the modern era, and we can quickly get the latest news on our electronic devices - thanks to modern technology. Although I believe many journalists are honest and have genuine integrity to their responsibility and ethics, we cannot blindly trust all of them.
In this digital age, competition in the journalism industry is fierce. In order to stay ahead in the business, some journalists may present news which they did not double-check or reports that lacks originality. It is also true that some journalists make clickbait news to attract attention from the public, which enables them to get payback from internet traffic. Therefore, how to distinguish reliable information is becoming increasingly vital for us because we cannot rely on every news or the reporter behind the news. For example, it is reported that five out of twenty pieces of news could be clickbait when we read news randomly from unverified news aggregation sites or social media.
Having said that, we still have many honest journalists who present the truth to their readers and have courage and integrity. They take their profession as a responsibility to the people and are not scared of danger and threats. They even take risks and carry on tough jobs to show the truth to the audience. Such journalists are doing excellent jobs to make the world a better place. To give an example, journalists who travel to war-torn areas to give us the real picture of the event, or do investigative reports to publish corruption are doing commendable jobs.  
In conclusion, we can do some cross-checking to make sure the news we read is reliable, because, in this day and age, fake news is ubiquitous. Numerous outstanding journalists are still working to reveal the fact to the ordinary public, but we should not trust every journalist as not all of them remain true to their duty and morality.
Essay 84:
Due to the emergence of technology, we have online news portals besides the printed newspapers, and it seems like anybody can be a journalist with a dot com website which puts an already questionable profession under more scrutiny and doubts. While trusting journalists and their reports, we should always verify the authenticity of the news and use our common sense.
Without reading newspapers and watching the news, we will be unaware of the world around us, and that is why newspapers play such a profound role in enhancing our knowledge. People who constantly work hard to bring that news and information to us are doing a tremendous job and they are often the reason we learn about corruption, global crisis, updates on an important national issue, and even the score of our favourite sports team. A responsible and honest journalist is like a soldier who fights a righteous battle to keep the citizens informed and eliminate corruption and unjust from society. However, not all of them are true to their responsibilities, and many of them put business and personal gains over ethics and responsibilities.
When trusting a news report or a journalist, thus, we should always check the news source and the credibility of the reporter, especially in this era of modern technology where online news portals have grown and spread like mushrooms. Clickbait journalism and politically motivated news are constantly bombarding us with the help of social media, and they have primarily one goal in mind - making money by playing with our emotions and feelings. As informed readers, we must rely on authoritative newspapers and verify any news source before believing them. For example, I generally tend to believe the news I read on bbc.com, but sometimes I also check the news on other sources. Our common sense about news can be a big tool to filter out the fabricated news as we should read the truth even if it is something we dislike rather than reading false news which is exactly what we want to hear or believe.
To conclude, we have good journalists and bad journalists, and it is our responsibility to be wary of non-authoritative news and not-so-credible journalists. We should also use our common sense to read news which is based on facts and truth.
Essay 86:
There has been a colossal upsurge in prodigies discussing the topic of appropriate school-going age for children. While many of them believe that toddlers should start school as early as possible, others think that they should stay home until they turn six or seven. I, wholeheartedly, agree with the latter view.
Many parents want their infants to join a school early, sometimes at 4 or 5 years old, so that they learn the fundamental things as soon as possible. Undoubtedly, this is the age when a child's cognitive development occurs at a full pace, and schools are expected to provide them ample opportunities to learn and grab new things as compared to home. In schools, these young children will learn important subjects like "Mathematics" or "English" as well as other essential behaviours and ethical aspects. It will help in shaping their future.
On the flip side, children till the age of six or seven should spend time with their parents at home as they learn what they see, play with, or observe. In other words, they cannot distinguish between good and bad habits, and can be misguided easily at school by peers. In addition to this, pressure in schools may restrict their ability to play freely and learn from their surroundings. Schools are often accused of restricting freedom and following strict rules which is not a positive way of teaching young children. A recent survey in Washington has revealed that many school education policies put too much emphasis on formal learning and rob children of their creative abilities.
To recapitulate, despite some benefits of starting school early, I think infants should not be sent to school until the age of six or seven to protect them from learning bad habits, while also providing them with more independence to cherish their childhood and learn naturally.
Essay 87:
Traditionally, a library is a place that shelves many books that readers can read or borrow. However, technological advancement and its tremendous effects on the way we learn new things and share information have redefined the concept of a library in recent days. Thus digital content and technological facilities are widely used in public libraries all around the world, and I quite disagree with the notion that these amenities are a waste of resources or space for a library.
Opposers of high-tech libraries often argue that they distract readers and costs additional money. I, however, believe that libraries with modern facilities are far more useful to readers, and allow the librarian to manage its collection in a more organised fashion. Multimedia resources offer readers a dynamic combination of images, sounds, videos and virtual tours. Thus listening to a famous historical speech or taking a virtual tour at a historical site is far more interactive and exciting than just reading about them. Moreover, multimedia facilities and DVDs in a library may initially seem expensive, but they preserve valuable resources for a longer time and contain important information for future research and reference. To cite an example, a single DVD can store the entire volume of Encyclopedia Britannica which would otherwise occupy a large shelf of a library.
Interestingly, a public library can actually save money and space and attract more readers with the use of technology and interactive contents. When they have computers and library management software, they barely need many staff members. Besides, it takes great effort to protect books from moisture, fire and human damages but digital contents can easily be copied and preserved for as many years as we want. As for attracting young generations, a high-tech library is more successful.
To conclude, the transformation of public libraries have made them more beneficial to readers and researchers as they now work as centres for interactive learning and knowledge sharing. It is expected that traditional libraries would start including digital and modern facilities to enhance human knowledge and experience.
Essay 89:
Ever since we realised our power to harness nature, we have started utilising it to make our life comfortable and more convenient. However, we then began to over-utilise this authority and damage nature to an extent that is catastrophic. Global warming and environmental pollutions are threatening our very existence on this planet, but we are neglecting our obligations to protect the environment. This is primarily because we fail to realise the real consequences of it and believe that it can be dealt with in the future.
The first reason for this is our incompetency to understand the dire consequences of climate change. Despite frequent headlines on TV and in newspapers all over the world, for instance, we are still oblivious to the fate of the world. We work hard to save some money to build a house or have a car in the future, but we cannot fathom how many parts of the world would become unlivable due to global warming and pollutions.
Another reason we are indifferent towards environmental degradation is our false confidence that it could be dealt with in the future. As a result, we are more concerned about solving more immediate problems such as housing shortage or traffic congestion than preventing the disaster that is only predicted to happen in the future. For instance, many individuals still believe that the rate of environmental degradation and global warming is not as severe as they are reported in the media, and technology that we will develop in the future would control it easily.
These beliefs and attitudes are obviously mistaken and we need to act now to control the damage. The youngsters must be taught their obligations to preserve nature in schools and encouraged to plant more trees. Besides, the government should adopt strict laws that would prohibit citizens from using disposable goods that are harmful to the environment. Finally, the government can encourage people to make the environment greener by offering tax incentives and other benefits.
To conclude, if we do not want to make our mother planet an unhabitable and barren place, we need to concede the real danger of climate change and act prudently to save it for us and our future generations.
Essay 91:
Many people contemplate their salary as the most salient feature of their job while others believe that their contributions to society through their professions hold more importance. In my opinion, a job should have ethical demands and needs to be passion-oriented. Otherwise, it would be futile to work merely for wages.
Let us first examine why passion is a prominent part of people's professional life. No doubt, passion acts as the fuel that drives people to withstand the caustic side of their work. If people chose a job that is not connected to their passion, they will fall victim to depression and perform poorly at their jobs. On the other hand, if we examine successful people's stories, we would find that almost all of them have been in the career that they were passionate about. Suppose Bill Gates or Steve Jobs, both of them were tech enthusiasts, and therefore took technology as the means of their career.
Besides, a job needs to be ethically demanding where people need to find something to do for humanity and society. Doing something for people not only will provide mental satisfaction but also will strengthen the purpose of their job life. Take Mother Theresa or Nelson Mandala for an example. Both of them are highly admired for their works for humanity and they did their best because they knew they were doing something for others and to make the world a better place.
To conclude, salary is somewhat important for people to support their expenses but if they do not feel attached to their work, they will feel exhausted in their life. They will also be suppressed by the undue pressure that could have been avoided if they had the passion and ethical context in their job.
Essay 92:
Salary is important because without money we will not be working for a company at all. Some people are always after money and do not hesitate to change their job if they are offered a higher salary. However, to others, job satisfaction is equally important as it ensures work-life balance. Many people would not compromise their job satisfaction for the money they are offered. Many top executives, who resign from large corporations in order to work for smaller companies or run their own companies, are great examples of how much they value job satisfaction over the wages they earn.
Moreover, "growth opportunities" is another aspect people often expect in their careers. A moderate salary and a great career growth aspect are far better than a higher salary and no career growth - according to many professionals, and they are prudent enough to envision the future than to run after only money. Finally, people often want to be in a career that is socially appreciated and valued. For example, a few of my colleagues left high-paid private jobs to take government jobs only because that would give them social recognition, and I quite understand the rationale for their decisions.
In conclusion, besides salary, job satisfaction which ensures a work-life balance is also important. Moreover, career growth and social recognition often drive us to choose a job that brings us less money than we could otherwise make from other jobs.
Essay 94:
Electronic transactions are gradually replacing the traditional banking system and the use of banknotes is being supplanted by credit and debit cards. The transformation toward a cashless society might be slow, but steady and widespread. This paradigm shift has both positive and negative aspects, and this essay deals with both of them.
Primarily, electronic transactions and plastic card payments are more convenient and are processed on the go. People neither have to carry a bulk amount of cash nor write a check - which usually takes a couple of days to clear the payment. The electronic payment system is global in nature and hassle-free. Consequently, the eCommerce industry has flourished and many individuals have their own online businesses without any brick and mortar shops. For instance, nowadays it has become pretty easy to shop with a VISA or a Master card, virtually from anywhere in the world. Personally, I hate standing in a long queue to pay my utility bills, and my cards let me do it from home - a time saver indeed.
On the contrary, the trend does not come without negative aspects. Although we can use these cards due to technological advancement, the risks of using plastic money, however, pertain to this technology. The primary threat to such payment mode is cybersecurity and hacking. For example, once a credit card is cloned or its sensitive data is hacked, the owner would suffer a great financial loss. A technology giant like Facebook has failed to protect its user data, for example, and the misuse of user data is a global concern. The same goes for plastic cards and online payment systems that have the same vulnerability.
To conclude, despite some adverse effects, the use of plastic money for making and receiving payments is the need of the hour. It provides a plethora of advantages but we have to be careful of its use.
Essay 96:
Many people believe that handwriting skill is no longer important in this era of technology, and children do not require investing time to hone their handwriting, especially when they will most likely type instead of writing for the rest of their life. Unfortunately, this opinion is misguided. I strongly believe that handwriting skill is important even in today’s digital world.
Good handwriting is important because when children learn to write clearly and concisely, they also learn how to express themselves properly. This leads to better academic and professional performance. I reckon handwriting is much more than simply putting letters on a page; it is a key part of learning and expressing ideas. Scrawls that cannot be read may be compared to speaking that cannot be understood. Handwriting is also important because children are required to use it daily in school, and those who struggle with the mechanics of handwriting may have trouble taking notes or completing their schoolwork. This can affect both their self-esteem and their attitude toward school. Good penmanship means better grades as studies show that the same mediocre paper is graded much higher if the handwriting is neat.
More importantly, handwriting proficiency inspires confidence despite some people's belief that handwriting is not related to better academic performance. The more children practise a skill such as handwriting, the stronger the motor pathways become until the skill becomes automatic. Furthermore, handwriting aids memory. For example, if a person writes a list or a note and then loses it, he is more likely to remember what he wrote than if he just tries to memorize it.
In conclusion, computer and digital data have no way replaced the necessity of handwriting skills. They are even more prevalent in this era of technology where good handwriting is related to academic performance and success, on the one hand, and inspires confidence, on the other hand.
Essay 97:
Handwriting skills involve craftsmanship and an artistic way of presenting letters, and require a great deal of time and practice. Since students are more likely to type rather than write on paper for the rest of their life, I do not believe that this skill is prevalent in this modern era where computers are used both in the academic and professional arenas.
To begin with, neat handwriting was a criterion for academic success in the past, but not anymore in this digital era. Assignments, classwork, tests and other school activities are mostly done on computers and this is why a student needs to grasp the skills of computing and typing more than presenting immaculate letter formations on paper. To illustrate an example, I  submitted three assignments during my last term and all of them were submitted to my teachers' emails, and not a single one was handwritten. Besides, time invested in honing excellent handwriting can be better utilised in mastering more important subjects and skills.
Moreover, the use of computers and the Internet in offices is a common trend. An employee is expected to be an expert computer user, and immaculate handwriting is not a requirement to be hired by a company. Ironically, better penmanship has little value in a world surrounded by technology. Considering the future, when computers would be more predominant, parents and teachers should focus more on teaching technology to students than instructing how much a letter should be stressed or curved!
To conclude, academic activities and professional needs, in this era of technology, compel students to have skills in computers and this is why it would be more practical to enhance their technical skills rather than handwriting skills- which have already become less important.
Essay 98:
Good handwriting of pupils is one of the essential skills for their academic success. The dominance of technology has changed many people's views on teaching students the art of writing. But I personally disagree that modernisation and the use of technology have made handwriting skills obsolete.
To begin with, good penmanship leads to better school performance in most cases. Also, it puts a solid impression on the readers or examiners. To exemplify this particular impression, 71 per cent of learners who have clear and nice handwriting, have good academic records and a reputation among schoolmates and teachers.
However, considering the contrary point of view that good handwriting by children is useless could be justified as the predominant use of technology where most of the writing is done on computers. Moreover, skills in technology should be one’s goal rather than only giving preferences to handwriting.
Nevertheless, only reading and speaking skills are not enough for better academic performance. Practising the topics by writing them on paper could be a much more efficient way to learn. For example, in mathematics, it is helpful to practice the problems and learn the formulas by writing. Additionally, writing is also a pivotal part of communication and this skill is necessary because research shows that when children learn how to do it, they also learn how to express themselves.
To conclude, it can be summarized that learning to write is indispensable and should be taught to children. Amid the sea of typed materials and digital data, handwritten materials have their own dominance, hence, handwriting skills should not be ignored.
Essay 100:
Ever since the dawn of industrialisation, the ethnic landscapes of many developed and developing nations have changed remarkably, and several western nations these days have a more heterogeneous population than ever before. It is often cited that this diversification of nationalities makes a country more appealing and leads to expeditious advancements. I completely agree with this view, and this will be shown in this essay by analysing the copiousness of the culture brought in by different nationalities and how a country can utilise the distinct strengths of people from different races and nationalities.
To begin with, the more diverse the nationalities in a country are, the richer its culture becomes. For instance, people from more than a hundred nationalities reside in Dubai and this leads to the availability of hundreds of different cuisines throughout the country. As a result, Dubai is called the ‘food capital’ of the Middle East. This, in turn, attracts tourists from all over the world who come to explore this richness in culture in Dubai. Hence, the contribution of having an amalgam of diverse types of people makes the culture of a country more intriguing.
Besides, many researchers agree that people from different countries have different strengths and weaknesses. For example, Singaporeans and other Asians are generally better at math, while Africans are known for their strength. Countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom have harnessed these strengths of people from different races to become global leaders. Therefore, the benefits of having a mixture of citizens in a country’s workforce are obvious.
To conclude, having a mixture of nationalities leads to the enrichment of cultures and faster advancement of a country. It is expected that more countries will benefit from this phenomenon in the future.
Essay 101:
Cosmopolitan societies are thought to be more attractive to international tourists due to their diversified cultural aspects, and they are often considered to have a strong economy that develops faster. However, as far as I am concerned, a mixture of nationalities in many countries is still problematic.
Admittedly, a culturally and ethnically diverse country attracts tourists from all over the world as the amalgamation of different cultures and their traditions, foods and lifestyles give birth to a truly cosmopolitan society. As a result of tourism development, the local economy grows to a certain extent.
However, countries that include populations from different nationalities and cultures often experience social issues which lead to civil and political unrest and hatred for each other. People from different backgrounds view things differently and have their own opinion about "values". If not dealt with properly, it may cause ethnic conflicts. Iraq or the United States, for example, experienced such hatred for decades. Even worse, in some countries, it divides the nation as citizens start possessing discriminatory attitudes towards minors. If such a situation prevails, the country will soon lose international tourists who might be the main driving force for their economic boost.
Moreover, the heterogeneous population in a country bring their own culture and thus the country loses its heritage and century-long tradition in the process. As a result, the country can no longer proclaim itself as a unique cultural landscape. For instance, many large cities in the world these days look almost the same and have no distinctive cultural identity.
To conclude, multi-cultural societies are prone to create many social problems and the government should give priority to solving such issues whenever they emerge so that it does not lead to social unrest and ambivalence situations.
Essay 102:
Global migration of people began with soaring industrialization and due to the major global wars. As a result, many developed nations experience the amalgamation of different cultures and traditions. It is often argued that this diversification of nationalities and cultures makes the country more attractive and helps the nation progress faster. I totally agree with this viewpoint.
First of all, in a country with cross-cultural integrity, public areas, facilities and tourist spots are designed considering all inhabitants including expatriates. Shopping malls, entertainment centres, beaches etc. public places become more appealing and usable. The cities become global towns and bear the mark of truly diverse traditions and cultures. For example, in several countries many nationalities reside together and taking this in mind, a global village is designed for them. Such a global village attracts thousands of tourists around the globe and it claims to be the world's tourism, leisure, shopping and entertainment destination.
In addition to this, cosmopolitan societies are better for the overall progress of a country. That is perhaps why nations such as the USA, Australia and Canada, which are primarily multi-cultural societies, enjoy greater prosperity, stability and harmony. The transaction between immigrants and residents would quicken the currency circulations and increase the demand for consumption - two essential elements of economic development. Thus a country with different ethnic groups and a diverse culture enjoy quicker progress and cultural richness.
In conclusion, counties with different cultural backgrounds and nationalities are much more intriguing. It is undeniable that cultural diversity in a country should be considered a welcoming trend for the attractiveness and faster growth of a nation.
Essay 104:
The most viable solution to the ever-growing traffic problem in urban areas, according to some, is to minimize the citizen's need for travel to workplaces, shopping malls and schools. However, I disagree with this viewpoint.
First, all professionals can not work from home. Doctors, engineers, bankers, nurses, sales executives and many other professionals have to visit their workplaces and meet people to execute their responsibilities. Similarly, if we shop online, dispatch staff will still be on the road to deliver products. In addition to this, many professional courses require field studies and laboratory work and an online course cannot provide such facilities. Online courses cannot be compared with classroom teaching and the quality of the products cannot be judged just by the pictures on a laptop or a phone. Thus people need to get outside to do their daily work. Furthermore, if somebody is confined to one place for a long to avoid being outside for their daily needs and professional duties, he or she may develop physical and psychological problems.
To truly tackle traffic congestion, we need more realistic solutions than restricting people's movement. One such solution can be improving public transportation. The convenience of public conveyance would discourage many to use their private cars, which is the primary reason for bad traffic in many cities. Furthermore, the government can encourage people to use an eco-friendly mode of transport, like the bicycle, by dedicating a separate lane for them. Many European and Asian cities, for example, already have separate cycle lanes and this has been truly effective in promoting environment-friendly vehicles and reducing traffic congestion.
In conclusion, in order to minimize traffic jams, the authority should enhance mass transportation facilities and encourage people to use eco-friendly transport rather than planning to restrict people's movements.
Essay 105:
Urbanization has brought the term traffic congestion into existence. A school of thought believes that traffic can only be controlled by limiting daily commuters' need for travel. However, I am not convinced that this is the only or the best way. Though it has some impact, other measures are required.
Apparently, reasons that substantiate the claim that "the less frequently people travel in a city, the fewer traffic jam they create" - require thorough analysis. Firstly, city dwellers commute daily primarily for their study, business, job, shopping and social needs. Some of these could be done from home as the advancement of technology has made it possible to learn, work and shop online. This will reduce traffic to a certain extent. To illustrate, a survey conducted by the Australian Traffic Authority outlines that 75% of commuters in private cars travel for shopping, job and education, and it is clear that if people can work from home, do online shopping and enrol in online courses, traffic congestion would be reduced, if not solved.
However, working from home is not permissible for a great number of professionals such as nurses, builders, doctors, police and so on. Therefore, they must travel to and from their workplaces daily. Moreover, online learning cannot replace the classroom-based education system, and online shopping is yet to substitute the traditional shopping method. Thus it is evident that controlling the necessity of travel for the day-to-day activities of citizens is not the only way to manage traffic problems. Improving public transportation, carpooling and encouraging pedestrians and cyclists could be some great solutions.
To conclude, limiting city dwellers' needs for their daily commute may help control traffic problems to some extent, but other measures should be in place. The government should encourage people to use eco-friendly transportations to tackle both bad traffic and pollution.
Essay 106:
Traffic congestion is perhaps a curse in many cities, and it kills valuable time on the one hand and degrades people's overall productivity and economic progress on the other hand. Since the main reason for traffic gridlocks on the roads is the overwhelming number of people who commute daily, limiting it to a reasonable extent is conceivably the best solution to curb the bad traffic.
Admittedly, the government and city administration cannot ask citizens to stay indoors and arrange the "work from home" facility for every professional as making it a regulation would create confusion and discontent. Moreover, people need to get outside not only for their professional, shopping and educational needs but also to socialise. Thus restricting people's need to commute daily seems like an unrealistic idea to many.
However, there are ways to implement it without creating confusion and dissatisfaction among citizens and curbing traffic problems at the same time. Since we need to reduce the number of commuters and vehicles on the road, which is the only viable solution to traffic problems, we can sort out the professionals who can work from home and then distribute the facilities like shopping centres, parks and banks to all residential areas so that people can get them within walking distance. For instance, IT professionals, lawyers, bookkeepers, customer service representatives, instructors and similar other professionals do not need to travel to their office daily as they can execute most of their responsibilities from home with the help of technology.
Moreover, improving some facilities and digitalising many services can deter people from unnecessary daily commuting. For instance,  many parents travel to their children's school daily to drop them off and pick them up. If schools offer safe and convenient transportation facilities, parents would rely on such facilities rather than travelling daily. Similarly, banking, utility bill payment and help desk should be digitalised so that we can complete our tasks from home rather than visiting those offices.
To conclude, traffic congestion in many cities is so big a problem that the authority is struggling to keep it under control. A large number of commuters and the vehicles they use are the primary reason for that, and it is expected that the government would facilitate people so that they need to commute less frequently.
Essay 108:
Museums and art exhibits have long been at the forefront of preserving and representing cultural values and histories, being utilized by almost all countries throughout the centuries. However, whether they should mainly represent local cultures or display an international collection is open to dispute. I personally believe that traditional museums should focus on outlining the cultural aspects and artworks of the country while having separate museums with items from other countries does not hurt the national feeling.
Educating people about the history and traditions of a country is the primary reason we have museums in the first place. They conserve important cultural specimens, artefacts, artworks and other items to boast about our past and help researchers dig deeper into history. Such museums, which primarily signify our tradition, should comprise things we, as a nation, can be proud of, rather than having internationally acclaimed artworks or sculptures. For instance, many national museums in Europe solely focus on preserving artefacts and artworks from the country and they are quite popular among international tourists.
Having said that, the concept of a museum, in the modern era, has changed to a great extent. We now have aviation museums, war memorials, motor museums, computer museums, archaeological museums and the list goes on. To make these types of museums popular and useful, we have to have international collections. For instance, the Motor Museum in Australia has a collection from more than 20 countries and they serve their purpose just fine. Museums with international compilations often attract tourists and can be a great way to promote tourism.
To conclude, national and traditional museums should focus on nurturing national history and heritage but we also need museums with international collections to make them more functional and famous. One does not necessarily diminish the necessity and usefulness of the other.
Essay 109:
Museums and art galleries help visitors better understand the role of history, showcase important artworks, and preserve important collections at the same time. But many people opine that the collection should include only the artefacts and artworks of the host country. I disagree with this opinion since art is a medium to express thoughts and ideas beyond boundaries, and the history of nations is interconnected.
Admittedly, museums and art exhibits exist to foster a better understanding of the importance of historical artefacts and arts in our lives and that is why national pride and archives should be emphasised to teach people their national history. But art is an important medium of free expression, and history extends beyond the border. So the collection of a museum should not be confined to geographical boundaries. For example, "Mona Lisa" is a legendary artwork by Leonardo Da Vinci who was an Italian artist in the 15th century. Despite being Italian, Da Vinci is an iconic genius for the whole world. Mona Lisa is now preserved at the Louvre Museum in France, and having this artwork and many other famous international paintings and sculptures, France can only boast of its fine collection that showcases masterpieces, great artworks and world history to the global audience.
Moreover, history is not confined within boundaries and if this was the case, we would have taught our students only our national history. The fate of nations was interconnected throughout history and it still is. So when we want to teach our children about our history, we must teach them about international events. Since one of the primary objectives of museums is to teach people about history, they must have artworks and collections from the international arena. Finally, when we display artefacts and works from foreign countries, we are connecting nations all over the world. Each culture has something new to teach and the cultural richness of a nation depends on how they accept a new culture. From this perspective, having museums that comprise collections only from the host country is a bad idea.
To conclude, museums and art galleries that have international artefacts and artworks besides having national collections are far rich and practical in exchanging cultural aspects and showcasing history.
Essay 110:
Museums and art galleries essentially showcase significant histories and artworks to the general audience both to educate them and to preserve important artefacts. Though some people advocate for an international collection in such important places, I firmly believe that local works and national history should always get the highest priority.
To begin with, a single museum can not represent all the important histories of the world due to space and budget issues, and the organisers of public art galleries need an exorbitant amount of money to display famous foreign artworks or sculptures. Thus, a museum should focus on becoming a place where people would learn about their own history and culture rather than being a place where they would wonder what the collections are all about. Visitors of a museum or an art gallery, which even include schoolgoers, should be able to relate the items they see so that they get inspired to foster nationalism and learn about their country, heritage and culture.
Moreover, museums and art exhibits are frequently visited by foreigners who want to get a glimpse of the local culture and history rather than seeing items that they have already seen in other museums perhaps in some other countries. So museums and similar other places become more acceptable when they conserve local culture and present national history. For instance, most of the tourists in my country find the national museum more interesting than other museums we have because our national museum offers a true insight into our past and heritage. Finally, preserving national history and artefacts in a museum and encouraging aspiring local artists makes more sense.
To conclude, museums and art galleries have significant roles in teaching people about their past and nurturing the talents of enthusiastic artists. It is more important that they have local collections and not foreign relics and arts which have little or no meaning to people who visit them.
Essay 111:
Some people insist that museums and art exhibitions ought to focus on showing local works to visitors instead of artefacts and artworks from overseas. I, however, disagree with this notion and believe that exhibitions of a wider range of artworks, including foreign ones, are quite beneficial to local people and culture.
The primary reason I disagree that museums and art centres should concentrate mainly on displaying local artworks is that it restricts the opportunities for spectators and artists to watch, enjoy and learn about diversified global artworks. Diversification helps citizens learn and appreciate various artworks which eventually enrich the culture of a nation. Since local museums are perhaps the most accessible venues for residents and aspiring artists to learn about arts, their collections should be as rich as possible.
Another rationale behind my view is that art galleries would offer more benefits when they display artworks created in other regions. This is because exhibitions of galleries could thus let children comprehend brilliant aspects of different nations and their cultures. Art galleries are one of the most common destinations of school trips and the impressions that students get from these galleries may broaden their horizons. Thus, displaying diversified arts is imperative to develop children’s knowledge and understanding of other cultures.
To conclude, a variety of artworks and artefacts in museums and art galleries would have more positive influences on cultural advancements and developing global perspectives of children and people alike. It is expected that museums and art centres would focus on these important issues when deciding the type of collection they are going to have.
Essay 113:
Undoubtedly, cricket is the most popular sport in subcontinental countries because there is hardly any part of this region where cricket is not played and relished. Though they have their national sports, cricket has gained far more popularity. Hereby, I will throw some light on some of the possible reasons behind this phenomenon.
The predominant reason for cricket being so popular among subcontinental nations is that this sport was introduced to them by the British during the colonial period. Most countries in this area became familiar with the rules and regulations of this game and started playing it and then ultimately became proficient in it. Moreover, these developing nations have imitated English culture for a long, whether it is style, language or sport, and the importance of the English language in these countries is convincing enough evidence of the fact that whatever was introduced by the English in their occupied countries continued to be flourished.
Moving further, national sports like hockey, Kabaddi, Volleyball and so on have limited international tournaments, whereas cricket has various events like ICC Cricket World Cup, IPL, Ashes Series, ICC World T20 and many more. Therefore, cricket gets a lot more media coverage than any other national game in these countries. As a result, everyone has a special affinity towards cricket and cricketers as well, especially youngsters who have a profound passion for this sport. Teams like India, Pakistan, Australia, South Africa and Sri Lanka have been world champions multiple times while others are emerging powers in cricket. So it is only natural that they have a huge number of fans who enjoy cricket as a sport.
To recapitulate, cricket dominates the sports world, particularly in countries like India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Australia and South Africa, which have gone through the influence of English culture during the English colonial era and where this sport is considered a part of national pride due to their success and fanbase.
While the national cricket teams in such countries like India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Australia and West Indies have won the world championships, their teams of national sports have little or no achievements in the international arena. Consequently, people tend to support the winning teams more often than their teams who play national sports.
The media attention that the cricketers in these countries enjoy made them celebrities and starts to the public eyes. And any win in the cricket ground is regarded as huge and celebrated with pomp and show.
Cricket, as a sport, was introduced to those nations almost 200 years ago during the English colonial era. In order to keep up with the British, people in these countries started adopting the game and started playing it ever since.
Different TV channels in the subcontinent area broadcast cricket competitions all day long while there is scarcely any TV channel that broadcast local and traditional games, unless, of course, there are important tournaments. As a result, people have started enjoying cricket more than their national sports.
Star cricketers are paid a huge sum of money while players of local and national sports are paid poorly. It has commercial and political reasons but it is only natural that youngsters would like to take up sports that have better potential. It goes without saying that the popularity of the sport is definitely due to the economic benefit it generates.
Successful sportsmen become idols for people, especially youngsters, which in turn converts them either into fans or prospective players. Subcontinental countries have produced many such legendary cricket players over the years and they still influence people to enjoy cricket.
Can you think of any other reason why cricket is more popular than national sports in many subcontinental countries? Please share it with us and our readers by leaving a comment. Thank you in advance.
Essay 114:
People have different views about learning history and using the knowledge of history to shape the future. Although some people argue that studying history has nothing to offer, others opine that examining history has a great prospect for discovering our past and using the knowledge to shape our future. This essay investigates both views, but I am personally inclined toward the latter viewpoint.
According to some people, learning history is a waste of time and energy. They believe that learning technology and science can bring significantly more benefits to humankind and the knowledge could be utilised for future development. History, on the contrary, has no utilisation in our daily life, according to them. For instance, science students can experiment and build helpful tools and devices, and this can lead to magnificent future inventions while pupils from history majors are imposed to memorize dates and events from the past.
But this is not the whole picture according to many others. Learning history not only tells us about past events but also prepares us for the future. We can not expect to avoid a large-scale catastrophe if we do not know why it happened in the first place. In the 19th century, for example, Ireland suffered the blight of potatoes, known as the Irish Potato Famine, and it happened because the Irish were largely dependent on potatoes. Had they planted another crop, this could have been avoided. However, this unpleasant history has taught us a great lesson - to cultivate a wide diversity of crops. Finally, teaching history in school helps foster patriotism among the youth which is quite important for a bright future generation.
In conclusion, people learn important lessons from experience and to build a prosperous nation, we must learn from our history which offers the greatest experience of all. Without knowledge of history, scientific discoveries alone cannot bring a wide range of advantages.
Essay 115:
History, according to many, is the gateway to the past and a reflection of the future. Others, however, see very little value in learning history and emphasize the study and practice of more important subjects and fields like science, arts, technology, engineering and so on. I possess the opinion that studying history is not useful, and we should better utilise our time by learning technology and science, and important life skills.
On the one hand, history offers us the opportunity to learn about our past society, civilisation, important national and global events, outcomes of major decisions, wars, social changes and so on. It helps us plan for a better future as the lessons learned from history can help us avoid catastrophes or plan for a brighter future. For instance, we can learn what triggered a major war or how a natural disaster caused havoc to people from history. Such knowledge and insights are important to prevent future conflicts and disasters. Moreover, many historical facts and findings inspire us to invent or discover new devices or theories to accelerate scientific and social progress.
On the other hand, most students study and memorise important dates, names of people, events, causes and results of something etc. when they study history. People, outside of the academic arena, also study history mostly for the sake of learning about past events. Such studies have little significance in the practical world. Knowing how ancient people used to survive has almost zero value in survival in the modern world. So goes for the inventions as well- learning about past inventions has very little to do with inventing something novel. Moreover, human history is full of human conflicts and wars, and learning about them may discourage people from respecting our very civilisation. This is why, I wholeheartedly believe that people should invest more time learning and researching science, technology, engineering, and arts to bring about positive changes in their lives as well as in the society they live in. 
To conclude, history can give us some details of the past which has very little value, in my opinion, to shape the future. It is more practical to learn and hone our knowledge and skills in science, arts and technology for a better future.      
Essay 117:
Universities, supreme citadels for building an enlightened generation, play a pivotal role in shaping a country's destiny. Thus the curriculum they follow to teach pupils has a profound impact on its overall outcome. Though some scholars believe that teaching a wide range of subjects at the tertiary level is far more beneficial than restraining the syllabus to a few particular subjects, I have reasons to disagree with this view.
First of all, universities cannot teach all the subjects to the disciples and the notion of teaching them a great number of subjects is impractical. For instance, an average university has more than 40 departments or so and they are meant to specialise students in a particular field, not try to make them experts in all trades only to hopelessly produce mediocre professionals. Many public universities are already struggling to finish the course in time and if more subjects are added, that would simply make the scenario worse.
Furthermore, a medical student, when forced to study history and poetry, would feel less connected to those subjects, ultimately ending with less specialised knowledge and skill. Similarly, a student from literature would find solving higher calculus a real challenge. The university already has its departments that pick students based on their merits and interests and the course offering should stick to that.
Finally, someone does not need to excel in all subjects to do better in his profession. If an engineering student is interested in studying history, he can always do so even if the university curriculum does not include it. Many eminent scientists had little knowledge of other subjects and that did not deter them from changing the world forever, and this can be a great example of how specific subjects at the tertiary level can be more beneficial than the idea of adding a list of unrelated subjects.
Some people advocate teaching university learners a wide range of subjects while others are in favour of making them specialised in a particular field with few subjects. I believe that teaching many different subjects make tertiary students better prepared for their career, life and society. This essay will outline my perspective.
It is true that when university pupils have fewer subjects to focus on, they can learn those subjects better as they get more time to master the concepts of those subjects. This is why many universities around the world have introduced many majors like creative arts, robotics, fashion design, and genetics, to name a few, that have fewer credit hours and hence, fewer subjects to study. And it has produced some talented professionals who have excelled in these fields over the years.
However, university education, I believe, is not meant to produce just skilled professionals who would work better in their respective job fields and make huge money. Rather, it should aim to create enlightened and knowledgeable individuals who would lead the nations in the future. This is why a doctor should learn the history of the nation so that he never forgets that his primary aim is to serve the nation and not make money. Similarly, if a software engineer has no knowledge of accounting, the financial sector would struggle to have useful software for their automation. I wholeheartedly believe that a university builds a strong foundation for a person to become a responsible and qualified individual and the more subjects they study the stronger their foundation becomes. 
In conclusion, studying fewer subjects in a university seems like have some benefits on the surface but it does not serve the true purpose of university education - to create leaders and an enlightened generation. So it is expected that universities would introduce a spectrum of subjects to most majors to reap the maximum benefit.
Essay 118:
It is often suggested that disciples of tertiary institutions should have a wide range of subjects in their curriculum rather than a few particular subjects. I, however, disagree with this viewpoint primarily for two major reasons.
First, universities aim to provide specialized knowledge to their pupils, not enhance their general knowledge. Students are offered admission to universities after they complete many years of academic studies on various subjects. They are in a tertiary institution primarily to gain specific knowledge related to their field of interest. Giving redundant pressure by imposing subjects unrelated to their field can become a hurdle in achieving the required goal sets in their life. For instance, there is little relationship between sociology and mathematics. Mathematics majors will get confused while learning various aspects of sociology and similarly, sociology students will be reluctant to solve complex mathematics.
In addition to this, many universities are already trying hard to maintain their recognized status and some are providing only specializations in a few subjects. The addition of more subjects to each faculty will add unnecessary weight, and as a result, there will be discordant opinions and actions among them. For example, 'Indian Institute of Technology Delhi' is among the top universities in India and provides specialization in scientific research and technology. If they are forced to add Arts related subjects to their science majors, they will soon find themselves struggling for their excellence.
In conclusion, universities are meant for specialization and students should study subjects related to their major or which they feel interested in. The urge to add a spectrum of irrelevant subjects will detriment the true purpose of university education.
Essay 120:
Distance learning, a modern phenomenon, has become widely popular, especially after the invention of the internet. In the pre-internet era, it was confined to posts and TV and could attract a nominal number of learners. Despite a boom in home-based learning trends due to technological advancements, it is not as beneficial as attending a formal educational institute, as far as I am concerned.
To begin with, university education is not restricted to some textbook lessons as it also focuses on creating an enlightened generation through a favourable environment where students learn to interact with each other, discover the diversity of cultures, and learn to face real-life challenges. Some video scripts and printed documents cannot teach them how to use those in the practical world. For instance, someone who learns a skill online finds it difficult to implement it in the real world. Thus their poor performance in professional life is imminent.
Moreover, instructors have extensive experience in dealing with students from different backgrounds and modify their lessons according to the capacity of the students. This is completely missing in the distance learning method and thus the single-package-fits-all model is less productive. Taking an online course to learn to play the guitar could be a classic example. A recent study by the University of Sussex reveals that nine out of ten online guitar learners fail to master it due to the lack of motivation and this is where formal education comes in - motivating students. Taking distance learning courses for learning a programming language, or how to cook a cuisine can be useful for many but this can never be an alternative to the education we receive from colleges and universities.
To conclude, we attend educational institutes to learn and become enlightened citizens, not to memorise lessons and pass exams. While distance learning can be a bonus to our already enlightened minds, it can never be the same as studying at a college or university.
Essay 121:
Distance learning programmes and online courses have gained huge momentum after the invention of the internet and it has become a major tool for education during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite some people's claim that it can never be as beneficial as the classroom-based education system, I beg to differ with the notion.
The classroom-based teaching system has some distinct advantages which some people fail to achieve when they enrol in a course offered on a TV, or even on the internet. In such distance-learning courses, teachers do not directly interact with the learners and cannot assess the individual progress of participants. Assessment of learners' exam papers is also not always accurate as there is a possibility of cheating in the exam. This is why some people never consider online or distance learning as fruitful as the traditional face-to-face learning method.
However, the global coronavirus pandemic, and restrictions due to this, forced us to adopt an online-based learning system to such an extent that people never imagined would happen. It has not only made learners get used to online learning but has also made teachers more adept at conducting online classes and exams. People now realise that online learning is a highly advantageous and less expensive way of learning and gaining skills. New tools like better LMS (Learning Management System), communication tools, exam tools, and assessment tools have revolutionised the whole concept of distance learning. It has also opened our eyes that technology has much to offer than just conducting online classes. For instance, during the corona pandemic, my younger sister's college adopted an online education and exam portal which they still use as the main method of assignment submission and conducting exams.
Finally, online learning platforms enable people from any age group and any region to enrol in courses and develop their skills at a very affordable price. For instance, a housewife from India can take a graphic design course offered by a teacher or a group of skilled graphic designers from the USA. This proves how online learning is going to replace many traditional learning methods due to its immense possibility and global accessibility.
In conclusion, the aspects that we have always believed online and distance learning methods can not offer have been achieved by technology and adopted by teachers and learners alike. Online learning is now mainstream and going to be as beneficial, and in some cases even more beneficial, as the traditional education system.
Essay 123:
Modern medical facilities and research in the healthcare sector have brought miracles to the world. We have cures for deadly diseases, and researchers are working with our genes to prevent diseases even before we are born - marvellous indeed! As a result, people these days live longer. This is an alarming trend according to some while I firmly believe that longer life expectancy offers far more advantages than demerits.
Many people opine that higher life expectancy increases the ratio of the older population and shrinks the active workforce. Thus they believe supporting the old generation is a burden for the country. But, this opinion is misguided and not backed by facts. With an increasing life expectancy, people these days remain more active and contribute to society even in their old age. As the government has raised the retirement age, old people are no longer a burden, rather an active workforce. To cite an example, professors, researchers, lawmakers, writers and many other professionals have vast experience and could contribute even more in their old age. Thus, when a physicist discovers a groundbreaking theory in his or her 70s, we should thank the enhanced medical research and treatment.
Finally, as the number of working parents is heightening, grandparents are the last hope for young children. Older people are doing us a favour by taking most of our family burdens. Besides, people who we consider no longer useful to society due to their age, have gifted us the world we live in today with their hard work, tax money and love.
Technological advancements have not only attributed to many new scientific discoveries but remarkably improved medicine and medical science also. This century is sanctified with comprehensive medical care, and the lifespan of people has enhanced and still increasing through modern medicines and treatments. I believe the result has blessed human civilisation and the disadvantages of increasing life expectancy are ignorable.
Ultra-modern facilities and advanced medicines have transformed medical facilities and cured many deadly diseases. With an improved lifespan, people can contribute more to society. Early retirement plans let them start another profession as they are more active these days. For instance, many professionals these days start their own businesses after their retirement. This trend welcomes freshers to have jobs and eradicates unemployment to a great extent while also contributing to the national economy.
Moreover, as a direct result of improved life expectancy, people can spend more time with their family and grandchildren. Working parents can leave their children in safe hands while at work. The way grandparents care for their grandchildren is incomparable to the attention they would receive from a daycare centre. So, we need our elder parents to be with us more than ever before. Finally, the way many see the elder generation as a responsibility to society is no longer true. These elder people can share their experiences that we can use to build a better and safer world. Older politicians, bankers, writers and researchers, for example, have far more to offer than their young counterparts.
In conclusion, an improved lifespan profoundly benefits the family as well as society. We should feel obliged to treat our ancestors as they did for us when we were children. They are no longer a burden, but an asset to the country.
Essay 124:
The global population will be eight billion soon, a staggeringly high number than the ideal population that the world can support, and advanced medical care has, on top of that, increased people's life expectancy, making the situation graver than ever before. Higher life expectancy, as a result of modern medical care, though thought to be a blessing, actually has more negative consequences on our economy and society. 
The first advantage of increased life expectancy is that it allows people to live longer and let them share their experiences with the younger members. These senior members can also look after the children and contribute to developing their ethical and moral characteristics. Moreover, they can sometimes remain active and contribute to the national economy. For instance, many elders start a shop or a business after their retirement and it has a positive contribution to creating jobs.
However, the disadvantages of a higher proportion of the aged population are profound and widespread. As the proportion of senior citizens increases in a country, the economy has to take more strain to support their living and healthcare. Moreover, higher life expectancy keeps more aged people in jobs and thus reduces career opportunities for younger people. The social consequences of this trend are also very high. Since young people are busy with their jobs, they have little time to care for their aged parents and grandparents. As a result, those people do not get enough time from their family members that they need. The youngsters also suffer from guilt as a result. This is leading us to a more selfish societal situation that we should avoid by all means.
To conclude, advanced medical care has blessed us with higher life expectancy but has also created profound economic and social problems. I believe the disadvantages of higher life expectancy far outweigh its benefits when we judge things from practical, economic and societal points of view.
Essay 126:
Gone are the days when shopping malls were purely for selling different merchandise, and people went there for buying and selling products. However, with the advent of modern shopping complexes, the trend has shifted, and many people spend their free time in shopping malls for various reasons. It has several positive impacts despite a few negative outcomes - I believe. This essay argues how this trend has enhanced people's shopping experience and enabled people to socialise. 
To begin with the negative aspects of spending leisure time in a shopping complex - it makes people lethargic and forces them to avoid outdoor activities. For instance, people who meet others in a park, swimming pool or playground get involved in group activities which is a good way of doing different physical exercises. On the contrary, when people meet friends in a shopping mall, they either eat fast food or watch a movie - both of which lack physical movements. On top of that, those people usually avoid outdoor activities as they prefer air-conditioned indoors more.
However, modern shopping malls have enhanced our shopping experience to a great extent. All the goods are available under a single roof, and they have a cosy environment and superior security. We can buy whatever we need at a completive price, eat our favourite dishes, try exotic menus, watch movies, play games, and even hit the gym located in such shopping complexes. Not to mention, meeting friends and relatives would be quite a cumbersome process had there been no modern shopping malls. Thus this trend is enormously beneficial to all of us. 
Moreover, most modern cities, especially those in populous countries, hardly have parks, swimming complexes, or playgrounds. This is why people can meet others at a shopping complex, and it helps them remain social rather than spending too much time online. For instance, whenever a few of my friends from university plan for a get-together, a nice shopping complex in our city comes to our mind because it makes the gathering and experience enjoyable. 
To conclude, the old notion of a shopping centre - just for buying and selling products - is no longer applicable in modern days since our expectations, lifestyles, and the availability of outdoor amenities have changed a great deal. So, spending free time or meeting others in a shopping mall should be treated as a welcoming trend due to its usefulness.  
Essay 127:
The establishment of modern shopping plazas in every nook and corner of the country, especially in cities, has inspired many to enjoy their spare time with friends and family, do some shopping, enjoy movies, and have meals together. Shopping for basic needs is an old trend, but it is changing rapidly and shopping malls, these days, are primarily recreational places for many. I believe this trend has an adverse effect on the young generation and frequent shoppers.
Modern shopping centres play a quintessential part by offering various products under a single roof ranging from the smallest to largest and the latest equipment and gadgets, costumes, ornaments, all types of fruits, vegetables, beauty products, kitchen appliances and so on. Besides, these shopping complexes have movie theatres, coffee shops, kid's corners and food courts to attract more people to spend their free time. However, people, who frequently go there, knowingly or unknowingly are becoming shopaholics, consuming junk foods and spending unproductive time. This has a detrimental effect on people, particularly on young minds. They often skip their classes to meet friends at a shopping mall, have aerated drinks, eat junk foods and avoid participating in different outdoor sports.
Furthermore, people's urge to purchase things they do not need creates a monetary asymmetry and put them in debt. When parents should take their children to a park or to a museum, they are actually taking them to a shopping mall and feeding them fast food. This will invite a disaster in terms of our future generation's health and education.
To conclude, I believe that killing a great deal of time in shopping centres will become a stagnated issue in the future. I strongly feel that shopping malls should be used as a place for purchasing essential commodities rather than a place for leisure activities.
Essay 128:
Shopping malls, these days, are considered major recreational spots by many while most people used to visit them for necessity in the past. This new trend has many negative impacts on people and society as a whole. This essay will argue why it is completely unnecessary for people to spend their free time in the marketplace and how this is a negative trend.
To begin with, modern shopping complexes offer many amenities and shoppers tend to enjoy roaming around different markets both for purchasing what they like and socialising. For instance, many pupils prefer to meet up in a shopping mall, watch a movie and later have snacks in the food court. They say this reduces the stress of the exams and makes them relaxed. Besides, with the decline of open places and parks, many families gather at large shopping malls to enjoy their holidays. However, this is a negative trend and has health hazards.
As a consequence, the young generation tends to forget the beauty of nature and the stress relief provided by the outdoor world. This, in fact, drains out the energy of the youth and makes them lethargic. For example, a walk in a park or a day on a beach refreshes the soul more evidently than a day in a mall. Besides, due to the excessive affection towards shopping, many people become shopaholics and get into debt.
To conclude, citizens should not spend their free time in shopping malls as there are better alternatives. It is hoped that people will go to a shopping mall to do essential shopping but spend their free time outdoors to enjoy the beauty of nature and take part in open-air activities.
Essay 130:
As an international language, English already dominates the world. From this regard, people around the world learn this language and whether learning it from a native mentor is the best approach is controversial. Though direct guidance from a native English teacher can be of great help, I do not consider it the best approach as there are other better methods to learn this language.
A teacher from an English-speaking country uses the language in his or her daily life and knows the context of a word, phrase and grammatical rule. Since command of a language requires more than learning the syntax, a teacher from a country like the UK or the USA can guide a student to learn about the practical use of the language and can effectively correct the student. For instance, most of the non-native students who pursue their university education in an English-speaking country become better users of English from the guideline they get from native teachers.
However, mentorship from native tutors is one of the ways to be fluent in English, not the best way. Self-study, exposure to English-speaking people and their cultures, online language courses, devotion and extensive reading habits can be more effective in becoming a good user of English. For instance, millions of self-made writers, journalists and interpreters have had no access to native teachers. Furthermore, passion to learn a language can often make someone versed in the language as these people invest a great deal of time to learn it from books and online resources. To cite an example, I studied in a school where roughly one in five students was from English-speaking countries but most of the composition contest prizes went to non-natives.
To conclude, having teachers who are from an English-speaking country is undeniably a great way to have better exposure to the language but this is not the best way to become versed in English. Self-study, passion and digital resources can be more helpful in most cases.
Essay 131:
The saying "if you want to learn the language, learn the culture first" is indeed true when learning English. From native teachers, we can learn the language in the best possible way because they can ingrain the culture of the language among the learners while also showing us the context of a word, or expression and helping us with the correct pronunciation.
To begin with, native educators use the language in their everyday life, and they know the contextual meaning of a word or expression. This is why learners comprehend words and expressions with their contextual meaning - which is perhaps the best way to learn English because, in it, the same word can mean several different things based on the context. For instance, only a native teacher can explain what the word "terrific" means when used by a British. Furthermore, teachers, whose first language is English, can teach students the culture and history associated with words and sentences, and it is a proven way to enhance vocabulary and master language skills. To cite an example, a teacher from London, who taught us literature at our university, explained a couple of Shakespear's writing which, despite reading before, most of us had no idea about. 
Moreover, a native teacher can teach better pronunciation than a non-native teacher. During my university days, I was surprised to find out how erroneous many of my English word pronunciations were. Thanks to a couple of native teachers who helped me with that. Finally, native mentors, unlike non-native teachers, focus more on the practical aspects of the language rather than forcing learners to memorise hundreds of grammatical rules. It makes learning more interesting and functional.
In conclusion, the English language could be learned in many different ways, but when someone has the opportunity to learn it from native instructors, this is definitely the best possible way to master the language and use it in everyday life.
Essay 133:
More than one-tenth of the global population suffers from some sort of psychological issue and yet mental illness gets far less priority than it deserves. Minor psychological issues are often ignored by the family while severe cases are inappropriately treated only to tag them as madmen.
To begin with, the number of general hospitals and the specialist doctors and nurses devoted to treating diseases of our body is overwhelmingly higher than the healthcare centre and staff allocated for mental complexities. Someone just needs to walk a few blocks to notice a hospital in any city. However, this is not the case for clinics that deal with patients’ mental issues. This is huge discrimination when World Health Organization clearly outlines the number of patients who need psychotherapists, mental support and treatment for their psychological intricacies.
Moreover, societal views towards a physically sick child are different than an autistic child. When the parents openly discuss the sickness of the former one, the latter tries to hide their children. This raises a serious question of moral integrity and social norm towards people who need special care. Due to the astigmatism of our social and healthcare system, we have so many cases of mental issues which go untreated. When each county increases its budget to research deadly diseases, there is scarcely any budget allocation for preventing suicides. For instance, the USA allocate a lion's share of its budget for the healthcare sector, but there is no separate allocation for preventing self-destruction, as this is not considered an illness at all.
To conclude, the time has come for us to change the old dogma about psychological problems and understand that proper treatment for psychosocial patients is as much important as treating physically ill people.
Essay 134:
Mental illnesses can significantly impact an individual's ability to function in their daily life, yet they are often invisible and harder to understand than physical illnesses. This can lead to society being less accepting of people with psychological illnesses compared to those with physical issues, and this essay completely agrees with this view. 
While it is true that psychological conditions can be just as debilitating as physical illnesses, it is also important to acknowledge that physical illnesses are often more obvious, life-threatening and easier to diagnose. Furthermore, physical illnesses often have a clear cause and treatment plan, whereas psychological illnesses can be more complex and difficult to diagnose.
However, it is important to note that the invisibility of psychological illnesses does not make them any less real or severe. People with mental illnesses often struggle with daily tasks and may experience a great deal of pain and suffering. This invisibility can also make it difficult for individuals to receive the support and resources they need to manage their illnesses. Society's lack of understanding and acceptance can also lead to stigmatization and discrimination, further exacerbating the struggles of those with psychological illnesses. For instance, according to a recent article published in the Women's Health magazine, nine out of ten women - who suffer from mental illnesses, think of ending their life at some point. This is quite disturbing considering the high percentages of such cases.
Moreover, the number of hospitals, diagnostic centres, doctors and healthcare service providers that we have to treat our physical ailments is far greater than the number of psychologists or mental therapists we have. The discrimination is even more severe in poor and developing countries where people do not have adequate means to seek medical help when they are ill, let alone talk to a psychoanalyst about their mental issues. This discrimination clearly outlines the societal biases towards our physical illness than our physiological sufferings.
In conclusion, it is crucial to raise awareness and educate people about psychological illnesses while also offering mental help when needed. This can help to reduce the stigma and increase acceptance and understanding of mental problems as they are not less severe than physical sickness.
Essay 136:
In this era of "freedom of speech and democracy", restricting information for the sake of vague public security and national importance seems quite irrational to many when others opine that information should be available only when the authority deems them suitable for access. Both parties have their reasons for arguments, and I personally believe that scientific studies, the academic arena, and businesses can be greatly benefitted if the information is made open to them without restrictions.
To begin with, sensitive information, that could penetrate state security, lead to public outcry, hand over technologies to terrorists and facilitates corporate monopoly in the trade sector, deserves to be scrutinized before making them public. In this digital era, information spread like wildfire and for the sake of maintaining global peace, it should be delimited, according to many. For instance, if nuclear technology is shared with all nations for scientific studies, the world will soon stand on the verge of obliteration, despite the inconceivable possibility this technology possesses to facilitate the citizens' energy demands.
On the contrary, scientific research largely depends on available data and previous findings. If valuable information and past findings are not shared openly with academics and researchers, global progress will become a standstill. For instance, the Internet is probably the most significant invention the modern world has produced and if this technology had not been shared by the US military, we would still be living in the pre-internet era. Moreover, clandestine information has no value if it is not implemented in the real world and thus curbing them is like slaughtering the potential for progress. Finally, world history suggests that the human race has advanced due to discoveries and inventions shared with the world as each finding went through profound modification and advancement. I thus personally favour the ideology that supports "free information for all".
In conclusion, information has limited value when it is constrained and not shared with great minds. For true global progress, restrictions on valuable information should be debarred and let people know the truth instead of keeping them in dark.
Essay 137:
Some people favour sharing information for research works, business development and academic needs without any filters or restrictions. Others, however, feel differently and opine that sensitive and valuable information should not be shared in any case. Both parties have their reasons, and this essay opines that not all information should be shared even for scientific, research and business purposes. 
It is understandable that when information is made available to organisations, scientists, researchers, and academics, they are best utilised. Since, those people work to bring innovations, restricting them to access important information can hinder progress. For instance, if expert economists are denied access to the state's financial data, they would neither be able to guide the nation for a better financial future nor can alert the nation in case of an imminent financial crisis.    
On the other hand, some information should never be shared because it is undeniable that unfiltered access to all information can sometimes be catastrophic. For instance, if a state allows businesses to have unrestricted access to all the data related to citizens, the organisations would start violating citizens' privacy. They would start using the data for their business gains while also selling the data to other companies. Moreover, nations have intelligence and defence agencies, and if their findings are shared with academics and researchers, they would end up falling into wrong hands and thus compromising the state's sovereignty and power of defence. This is why, I personally believe that a state should share information that can bring innovation and help the nation progress, and at the same time, make some data restricted so that rough people do not have access to such critical and sensitive data.  
In conclusion, information is immensely important when they are properly utilised and could also be destructive if they are misused by the wrong people. This is why the information should be shared for the betterment of the nation but some sensitive data should never be shared.
Essay 138:
Some people advocate for making all information available in science, business, engineering and research as they believe that sharing information in such fields to the fullest extent possible will ultimately benefit society as a whole. Others, however, think that some information and state secrets are too sensitive to be shared freely. This essay explores both perspectives. In my opinion, important sectors in a country should have unrestricted access to important and useful data.
It is important to consider the benefits of making information available for sectors that bring innovation and development to a nation. It is undeniable that by sharing new findings and useful data, society can progress and prosper faster. For example, after the discovery of the first antibacterial drug was made public, it allowed the entire world to benefit from its use as an effective medication against infectious diseases. Additionally, sharing valuable and meaningful information can lead to collaboration and progress in research, as well as the development of new technologies and products for a nation. It is also apparent that a society, where people have limited access to information, is less likely to become pioneers in technology, invention and research.
However, there are also some valid arguments against sharing all information considering the sensitivity of the information in question. Intellectual property rights are an important consideration here, as inventors and researchers invest both their knowledge and significant amounts of money to achieve their goals. Publishing their findings prematurely can prevent them from fully reaping the rewards of their hard work. A good example is "Apple Inc." which invented different ingenious technological devices, and if the research data were published, it would not be able to earn profits as there would be competitors who would use the findings and compete in the market.
In conclusion, it is important to appreciate the rights of individuals and businesses to protect their intellectual property, the progress and prosperity of a nation should get more priority, and ultimately, the sharing of information can lead to greater advancements and benefits for all.
Essay 140:
Today's world is staggering under conflicts, terrorism and cross-border wars that make global peace a distant reality. Even in this gloomy moment, many people think that international sporting events can play an essential role in restoring to global peace and harmony. I agree with this viewpoint primarily because I believe that global sporting events have the power to bring people and nations closer, and promote the message of peace.
It is sometimes observed that major sporting events create tensions and bring unfavourable outcomes like controversy, heated debate and misunderstanding. In such events, it may seem that such international sporting events make nations hate each other rather than bring them closer. However, such controversies are short-lived, and they are sparked among die-hard fans and online discussions while most viewers tend to enjoy the game and remain out of conflict.
There is no denying that sports on such an international scale bring people together. Regardless of race, religion, nationality and gender, sports fans share the same passion and enthusiasm. And when they gather in a venue, they tend to learn from each other and see the human side of people. It brings them closer and gives them an extraordinary opportunity to share their sportsmanship quality and compassion for all people in the world. For instance, the Olympic Games event gives a perfect opportunity for athletes from all around the world to gather and display their athletic prowess to a global audience where people appreciate their performance and talents and forget their dissimilarities.
Moreover, such global events promote the message of peace as the spirit of games overcome the barriers and conflicts nations have. This is why millions of people become one when their national team performs to bring glory to the nation. They forget the differences in their ethnicity, background and class, and it helps positively promote nationality; thus paving the way for peace and unity. For instance, when players of two rival nations like India and Pakistan, or Iran and the USA, show amicable behaviours on and off the field, millions of audiences learn to appreciate their relationship with the people of the rival nation. This is immensely helpful in paving the way to maintaining global peace.
Major sporting events are meant for athletes and sportspersons to perform and bring glory to their nations while also positively promoting global harmony. However, it is a cruet reality that such international events fail to promote global peace and accord, and are often subject to controversy and conflicts. This is why, I disagree with the opinion that such international sporting competitions contribute positively towards global stability, peace and unity.
To begin with, when players display excellent sportsmanship in a major sporting event, the global audience tent to enjoy the performance. Friendly relationships among players from rival nations also set examples for spectators. But, it has little impact on the politics of two rival nations and has very little to do with lasting peace among nations. For instance, millions of people enjoy when players of India and Pakistan perform in cricket stadiums. It often brings citizens of these two countries together, but it has failed to make any positive impact on the political relationships between these two nations.
Moreover, major sporting events are the stages for competitions, and there is always a winning and a losing team. The same decision made by a match referee is welcomed by the fans of a nation while vehemently opposed by the supporter of another team. It is not a conducive approach to supporting peace, unity and brotherhood among people from different nations. Rather, it sparks argument and controversy. For instance, after most World Cup competitions, people have diving opinions about the decisions made by referees, and they never tend to agree with the opposing supporters. It has even sparked fights and conflicts in and out of the stadium.
To conclude, international sporting events are great events to bring people of different nations to a common platform, but due to their competitive natures and controversies, they fail to help promote peace and harmony among nations.
Essay 141:
Sports, in the past, used to be considered a juvenile activity confined to parks and indoors only. But sports, these days, have pushed the boundaries and attracted national and international players and audience by bringing people closer. So, there is no denying that sports have the power to unite the world and maintain global peace, and I completely agree with this viewpoint.
Undoubtedly, sports at the international level play a sterling role in diplomatic relations among different nations. Owing to historical or political reasons, not all countries are at peace with each other. Admittedly, sports evoke similar pleasure and satisfaction as a victory in a war does, but it brings nations together. Moreover, global sports events can be icebreaker as competitors from nations create a common platform for global leaders, organizations, and athletes to interact in a more convenient and sophisticated way. A good illustration is the Olympic games in which the whole world can be brought together and this has a positive impact on maintaining global harmony.
Furthermore, sports evokes high nationalistic passions towards the country along with providing a platform for patriotic emotions to be released. It is a constructive way to exhibit one's patriotic emotions. Even, international sporting events such as Commonwealth games bring recognition to small countries. For instance, it is difficult to know about the West Indies and Nepal, however, they are well-known countries just because of their cricket teams. By and large, the sport is the only activity that delivers a clear message of peace and paves the road to building world harmony.
Essay 142:
Crimes, in many countries, have gone beyond a tolerable rate and it is a common practice to put convicted people in prisons. A segment of society opines that not all crimes are equal and the repercussion of harsh sentence for all offences is uncivilised. They outline the need for unpaid community service as punishment for mild-offenders and youngsters and I also believe that certain offenders should be given non-custodial sentences.
The predominant reason for me to believe in voluntary community service like cleaning streets, planting trees, and working for charity instead of the prison sentence is that many offenders are not born criminals, and circumstances often push them to commit a transgression. Besides, when such unpremeditated convicts are expelled from society, they incline to re-offend in isolation as there is none to accept them. Apart from this, juvenile delinquents should be rehabilitated by indulging them in community services. A recent study reveals that many youngsters who had been in prison for a long time often end up becoming even bigger criminals.
However, brutal offenders who commit heinous crimes like premeditated murder, vandalism, abduction, hijacking, rapes and so on should be punished to set examples in society. Thus, the background of a criminal and the motif of a crime should be considered. For instance, if a teenager steals food from a store as his mother is starving is a completely different crime than someone robbing an old lady and stabbing her violently. The former deserves a second chance while the latter should be imprisoned.
To recapitulate, someone with no previous record of crime and a sensible reason for minor misconduct should be treated differently than a serial killer. The objective of the law is to maintain peace in society, not to punish people. Thus unpaid community service is a great option to let some convicted lament their crime and do something good for society.
Essay 143:
Historical buildings are valuable treasures for a country and should be preserved even if the government needs to spend hefty amounts on them. I completely agree with this viewpoint and my position is outlined in this essay.
First of all, old and traditional buildings are of great architectural importance. Their sublime design attracts tourists and locals alike and is quite rare in modern structures. These historical edifices also give us an opportunity to learn about the glorious past. For example, the Roman Colosseum in Rome not only shows how awe-inspiring the ancient architectures were but also points out a massive arena used as a stadium for gladiators' fighting and has space to house around 50,000 spectators in tiered seating. This structure is a predominant representative of Roman culture and civilisation that modern historians cherish profoundly.
In addition to this, historical monuments also serve as tourist magnetism in many countries. In today's world, many people plan their vacations in places of historical importance as they are curious to know more about the culture and traditions of the past. Many nations are benefited from these tourists, and as a result, they possess a booming tourism industry. For instance, millions of tourists including international tourists visit the Taj Mahal in India every year. This provides the government with a huge profit and also employs many locals, thus assisting the government financially.
Essay 144:
First impressions, without a doubt, have great importance, but they do not always reveal the true characteristics of a person and I believe that first impressions are not always accurate. This essay discusses why first impressions may often be deceptive and less important in judging someone.
To begin with, first impressions often reflect a great deal of information about a person, especially if we meet this person all of a sudden. We can judge him from the way he dresses, speaks, starts a conversation and expresses his views. This is often the true reflection of a person's character. But this can often be ambiguous. For instance, my experience has taught me that people who become friends very quickly are less serious about a long-term friendship though they give an opposite impression on their first meet.
Moreover, people try to behave modestly, act friendly, show compassion and exhibit their positive sides when they meet someone for the first time. Only a long-term observation can express their true nature and intention. From this regard, I would not agree with the view that my initial impressions about someone are always right. I believe we can learn many things about a person only when we spend time with the person, and can understand their true colour when we see and meet them closely.
To conclude, people are one of the greatest mysteries in the world and judging someone at the first meet is kind of irrational. No doubt a great deal about someone could be learned from the first encounter, but this is not always right, at least not in my experience.
Essay 145:
Two lines of thoughts exist when it comes to the significance of first impressions, and for many, they form the basis for judging a person’s personality and background. I believe that first impression is important to some extent; however, my support is in the favour of knowing the person better instead of establishing the judgments just on looks and dress-up as I support the more holistic way of getting to know people.
To begin with, I believe that first impressions give just a glimpse of somebody’s character. There can be a variety of underlying factors and reasons for which the person might behave in a particular way. If someone, for example, does not initiate a conversation and does not smile at a party where it is required to mingle, it could be because the person is ill or have some sort of personal crisis going on. Judging by first impressions, that person can be easily labelled as arrogant and unfriendly. However, if someone makes an effort to know the person and the reason behind being a recluse in the party, the former judgment is entirely reversed. In addition, outer appearances change and evolve but the inner personality remains almost the same. People who form their perception on the basis of fleeting outer appearances are often mistaken.
On the contrary, in some instances, for instance, a job interview, first impressions are of foremost importance. Recruiters are specifically trained to sort potential employees based on the first impression. The first impression not only includes the way of dressing, but also the way a person speaks and carries himself.
To conclude, although there are instances where first impressions matter and needed to be taken into account, I strongly believe that it is always prudent to get to know a person better before jumping to a conclusion.
Essay 147:
It is irrefutable that a country's growth largely depends on how educated and healthy its citizens are. The burgeoning population and the lack of funds often make it harder for the authority to bear the expenses of their needs, especially in education, housing and treatment. I believe that an effective solution would be to divide the expenditures between the government and the individuals.
To begin with, education, nowadays, plays a vital role in the development of a society. Not only it creates job opportunities, but also help people become aware of the socio-economic issues of the country. Making education free till the age of 18 would encourage the pupils to finish at least their secondary education. For instance, the percentage of student enrollment in schools in 2011 in my country increased by 19% than that of 2009, and it was because the government exempted fees for students in these classes.
Moreover, the healthcare system can also be improved by providing either health insurance or schemes that cover a minimum of 50 per cent of the cost. Thus people would not feel that healthcare is expensive while the government would not need to bear the expenses alone. A healthier nation can help the country achieve greater heights as citizens in such countries are more productive. Consequently, economic growths will get bolstered and the government would be able to become self-reliant.
To conclude, with the implementation of the said measures there would be no burden on either the government or individuals. Both the government and individuals can go hand in hand to cope with this and build an enlightened and healthy nation.
Essay 148:
Healthcare and education are two fundamental rights of every human being, and they are essential for the development of a country. Who should, however, bear the cost of healthcare and education - the public or the government, is controversial. But, I sincerely believe that the government should take responsibility to ensure free education and treatment to its citizens.
To commence with, the government is not the authoritarian ruler of a country, not at least in this modern era. Rather a country has an administrative system so that the country runs properly, the authority can take development initiatives, laws and orders are maintained, citizens get their basic rights, and the country stands proudly among the world nations. If this is what the management wants to achieve it must alleviate people from poverty through education and training, and offer highly effective healthcare facility, without which the country and its tradition would crumble. Giving responsibility to its citizen to take care of their education and healthcare would be the last thing a government should do.
Moreover, without ensuring education for all, no country can achieve growth and eliminate poverty, and keep pace with the world. Education not only helps people become financially independent but also enlighten them. On the other hand, proper healthcare makes a healthy nation that eventually contributes to building a better nation. The struggling education and healthcare systems in many poor countries, for example, are the main obstacle to their development.
Finally, the government collects a staggering amount of revenue from direct and indirect tax each year. If this tax money is not spent on educating the taxpayers' children or ensuring their proper treatment, no other policy can better utilise this money. Besides, poor citizens rely on the government when it comes to changing their fate and keeping them well. Without ensuring education for their children and offering them healthcare services, the government fails to keep its promises.
To conclude, healthcare and education are fundamental rights of citizens, and the government must ensure these two rights to them to fulfil its obligation to the nation and to help the country develop.
Essay 150:
How much responsibility a child should take and whether modern children are less interested in executing their duties and obligations is disputable. While offsprings in some countries still take many responsibilities, a great number of them, in other countries, are busy with their education and hobbies. I believe that the way children take responsibilities has changed over time, mostly as a positive development, and to what extent a youth should carry out these liabilities should be determined by the family and social condition.
To begin with, the social, economic and family structure in the past, in most of the countries, forced parents to distribute responsibilities among children and it was common for many young children to work hard and take care of younger family members besides their education. These young children learnt how to manage budgets, share with other family members and take challenges in life. Those important lessons, according to many, are no longer spread among the modern young generation and thus they become more selfish.
However, with the change in the family structure and social norm, people these days want their children to excel in education and other creative fields rather than taking care of the family and finishing house chores. Joint family predominated society and parents had more children in the past. With the rise of the nuclear family and one-to-two-child-family policy, parents now focus on children's education, unlike in the past. In my opinion, blaming children for not taking responsibilities is an impartial judgement as modern children have far more pressure from schools, society and parents. They are not expected to earn money or do household works in a well-to-do family. With the increasing literacy rates, gender equality, women empowerment and a better lifestyle, the trend has more positive outcomes, without a doubt.
To conclude, these days, we want our children to be the best scorer, best athlete, and outshine in everything they do unlike the past when parents wanted assistance from their offsprings to support the family. Thus the changes have brought numerous developments, and the move was inevitable with the paradigm shift of social structure.
Essay 152:
Commemoration of important national events is a part of a nation's pride and a way to show respects to its tradition and history. Such events are instrumental in motivating the new generation to be patriots and bestow tribute to people whose contributions are unforgettable. Thus the amount spent on such celebrations is justified.
To begin with, public ceremonies are important in terms of spreading nationality, giving mass people a reason to forget their differences and improving public relations. The amount spent on such events is often disputed by many, but this opinion, is in no way, practical and the importance of observing national events is unparalleled. These celebrations, for example, teach us who we really are, how much our ancestors had sacrificed to give us a better country and how we are all connected as a nation. In my early childhood, I did not show an acute interest in the history of our country until I noticed the way people observe Independent Day and how the whole nation remembers the sacrifices of the martyrs from our country. We need to celebrate our significant national days to pass the history to the next generations.
Now getting back to using the fund on more important things - a government already has a plan in place for disaster recovery and using funds for important sectors. Each sector in a country already gets a share of the national budget and we need to focus more on prudently using the fund for true development, not switching fund from one important sector to another. Finally, festivals are people's fundamental rights and a government should always support such public festivals including religious and national galas to prove that the authority works for the public, not against them.
To conclude, public celebrations and a government's role to organise it and using the national fund to support it has a great influence in fostering nationality, showing a government's support to the people and this is why the amount spent for such events is essential.
Essay 154:
Online education is a comparatively new trend and thousands of educational institutes have already embraced this method to offer their courses. While some negative aspects of this development could not be ignored, the advantages of it far outweigh the demerits.
To begin with, many universities in developed countries offer online degrees and short courses, and they have started doing so only after proper research. The research proved that Internet-based courses are advantageous both for the students and teachers. The intuitive and methodical lessons offered by an online course is planned by several university teachers and technology experts and hence they maintain a rigid quality. The widespread use of the Internet makes it handy for people to enrol in a course without considering time and distance. This trend has attracted thousands of professionals, housewives and elderly people to continue their education or take courses of their choices. For instance, as many as twenty-five thousand housewives in the USA complete their preferred online courses and diplomas in a year. Attending traditional classroom-based courses were impossible for this large number of housewives and busy professionals.
Moreover, Internet-based courses are easier to follow and someone can retake the same lessons over and over again, unlike traditional classes. Thus many students have reported the Khan Academy, Linda, and Udemy, renowned Internet-based online course websites, to be their preferred learning tools. Many skill-developing online courses, for example, have assisted thousands of young people to pursue their career in technology and this has all been possible with Internet-based learning.
The downside of this trend is the cost and lack of proper supervision by a teacher. Courses offered by prestigious universities are often far too expensive for a poor student to bear. Teachers' guidance and motivation often play a great role in a pupil's success and the online course cannot be a suitable substitute for the motivation teachers can offer.
To conclude, technological advancements in education, especially online education, is a great leap towards a world without illiteracy and unemployment. Hence, this is such a positive development though it lacks a teacher's motivation and direct supervision.
Essay 156:
Choosing a place to live in and whether to rent it or own it is a big decision to make. Many people prefer to own a house rather than living in a rented apartment while others choose to do exactly the opposite. I believe that owning a house has far more advantages than renting an apartment.
To commence with, people often rent a house because purchasing a property requires a great deal of money and the skyrocketing price in big cities makes it impossible for many to own a house. These people naturally rent an apartment. There are certain advantages to living in a rented apartment. First of all, the person does not have to pay a huge sum of money at a time and does not need to pay housing taxes and bear the costs of maintenance. Moreover, such people can change the living place based on the location of their workplace and children’s school. The renovation of the apartment is the landlord’s responsibility and the tenants do not need to worry about it.
On the contrary, owning a house gives a sense of personal achievement that tenants cannot enjoy. A house is a permanent asset and with time its price increases. The landlord can rent the house and this can be a steady source of earning for him. Furthermore, being the owner of a house means there is no one over the shoulder to watch what someone is doing and no sudden notice for evacuation. For instance, we had to vacate our apartment all of a sudden at least thrice until we purchased our own house a decade earlier. This is some sort of freedom that only house owners enjoy. Besides, the owner can construct and design the house the way he likes and enjoy open space, garden, and other facilities in the house.
Essay 157:
According to the traditional belief, men are the breadwinners while females are caregivers and responsible for taking care of the family. This belief, along with some old-fashioned views like boys are good at mathematics while females are not, is the primary reason for many parents to encourage their sons to study science while daughters art-related subjects. I wholeheartedly believe that this trend should change.
To begin with, it is generally believed that boys are good at science-related subjects. This view is rooted so deep in our society that many females have already accepted it. This is more prevalent in developing countries where parents expect their sons to have a career while daughters become moderately educated and finally get married and have a family. Strangely, studying in science majors require more money in most countries, and this is why parents naturally select their boys to study science. Females, on the other hand, need to take many responsibilities of the family even during their student life and prefer to have subjects that do not require a great deal of study, as they consider it.
Men and women have similar capacities and hidden potentials. Given the equal opportunity, many women would excel in science-related subjects. Great scientists like Marie Curie, Ada Lovelace, and Emilie du Chatelet have proved that women are no less capable than men when it comes to science. The heinous trend of gender discrimination, even in the education sector, should stop. The good news is that women in many engineering and technology subjects are already occupying half of the seats in many prestigious universities. Thus the day is not far away when the social custom or emotional aversion of parents would accept that their daughters are just as talented as their sons are in any area, including science.
To conclude, women empowerment is quite an essential factor for the overall development of a nation, and that is why females should get a fair chance to participate in any subjects, including science majors, in schools and universities. This trend would bring more positive outcomes than restricting their fields of education and work.
Essay 159:
Parenting is perhaps the greatest responsibility of our life and mistakes and wrong decisions as parents can ruin a family as well as the future of a child. Since many young people become parents and the number of nuclear families is on the rise, many experts emphasize the importance of parenting courses for both fathers and mothers. I personally agree with this notion as I believe that such sessions would be immensely helpful.
To begin with, proper parenting requires a great deal of knowledge and dedication. Sometimes minor negligence and lack of knowledge can lead to catastrophic outcomes. For instance, if busy parents forget to vaccinate a newborn, that would jeopardize the offspring’s life. Similarly, many parents believe in silly superstitions that influence them to make bad choices. If those parents attend a course where experts share their opinions on different aspects of child fostering and proper parenting, they would be highly benefitted. For example, my cousin Paula, who became a mother a few months ago believed that her child had a problem with digestion and need medical attention. However, it was revealed that the way she fed her daughter was not correct. I believe that a suitable course that brings out different aspects of upbringing a child, both moral and practical aspects, would prove out to be important for newly become parents.
Moreover, the increasing trends of single parents and nuclear family lack the expert opinion of the grandparents, unlike in the past. This is why the need for such parenting sessions has risen even more. Such sessions bring parents together, let them share their views, forms a social relationship and help people learn the real facts about their personal prejudices. This is a great way to educate the "to-be-parents", and "newly-become-parents" to learn more about the practical aspects of parenting. It also makes a better society, in a broader sense.
To conclude, being informed and educated parents is an important aspect to become good parents. Since parenting courses help people in a diverse way, it is indeed a good idea for people to participate in such courses.
Essay 160:
Raising a child is considered a beautiful experience by parents and newly become parents often find it difficult. Though some parents feel that training classes on parenting will help them nurture their child properly, I believe otherwise. This essay will argue why it is unnecessary to undergo parenting training sessions in order to nurture one’s child.
In today’s fast-growing world, parents believe that coaching on parenting and professional advice will help them responsibly raise their child. The reason parents feel the need for such courses is mainly because of the busy lifestyle and the growth of nuclear families. They neither not talk to their parents and get advice, nor are they confident enough in their ability to look after their child. For instance, in India, certain institutions provide full-time classes on parenting and their demand is increasing. Distance from other senior members of the family is the main reason so many parents turn to such institutions.
However, being a parent is a natural and wonderful experience that does not require any training. As soon as a couple enters the phase of parenting, the ability to raise their child is naturally born in them. It’s just the confidence that is required and rest is attained gradually. Parenting needs are not the same for all and thus a predefined course is insufficient for many couples.
To conclude, the parenting ability is naturally inbuilt in every individual and one has to just figure that out in order to raise their child and this has to attain through expertise, not from theoretical courses.
Essay 162:
Perhaps the greatest threat to the world is not the atomic bombs, the regional conflicts, terrorism, an outbreak of population or political instability but the climate change and environmental degradation. If we do not address this greatest danger properly, we will be responsible for our own extinction, and I do not believe that we should let it happen by doing nothing about it.
To begin with, the rising temperature, Arctic ice melt, deforestation, uncontrolled industrialization, air pollution and depletion of the ozone layer are all connected and would lead to a single event- the destruction of the world. We have already harmed the environment to a great extent and the time has come for all nations to work together to reduce the environmental damage. The sudden flood in the USA, intense storm in Asia, unpredictable droughts in Africa are all resulting from climate change and this change is occurring rapidly than ever before. If we let this continue, the future would be even more perilous. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, consequences of climate changes include the increased intensity of storms including tropical cyclones, increased risks of drought and, wetter Asian monsoon, and, possibly, more intense mid-latitude storms. According to a recent report, global warming would cause sea levels to rise up to 4 feet by 2100 and many countries including some South Asian countries would suffer greatly from that.
The last thing the human should do to turn a blind eye to this imminent problem and learn to live with it, of course, unless we want the termination of the human race, that would be a whole different issue. There is a lot to do and we should start implementing regional cooperation right now. Every individual should contribute by emitting fewer fumes and planting as many trees as possible while the use of fossil fuel should be globally prohibited. Industrial countries have more responsibilities as they contribute more to environmental degradation and an international panel should be formed by giving it a supreme power to make any legislation to kerb the environmental damages.
To conclude, for our existence on Mother Earth, we should take immediate actions both at individual and international levels to check climate change. Otherwise, we will fail to save our planet and future generations.
Essay 164:
School curriculums may vary from school to school, but their primary objective is the same everywhere which is to educate and enlighten students. However, some people claim that school should focus more on job-oriented subjects rather than teaching traditional ones like arts and history. I personally disagree with this view and believe that traditional subjects are just as important as skill-oriented subjects are.
To begin with, ‘job-oriented subject’ is itself an inexplicit term. Some would say that subjects that enhance practical skills like computing or gardening are job-oriented subjects, but no one can assure that all students in a class would become computer engineers and specialists in planting and gardening. That is why forcing pupils to study subjects that they do not feel interested in would bring negative results.
Furthermore, schools are meant to nurture young students’ creativity, foster their talent to let them explore their true potential. From this perspective, imposing job-related subjects is like killing the inner soul of the future generation. Finally, if schools can bring diversity among students and inform them about different perspectives of life, the students would themselves choose their career and transcend in future. So there is no need to create a robotic generation with a particular skill only.
Arts and history are as much important as any science and technical subjects are. The study of history empowers us to be prepared for the future and learn from our past mistakes. Similarly, arts and other traditional subjects allow us to learn to appreciate life. We revere Van Gauge and Leonardo da Vinci as much as we admire Sir Isaac Newton and Einstein. The world needs great artists and historians no less than it needs scientists and technicians.
To conclude, schools should equally focus on traditional subjects and skill-oriented subjects and nurture students’ hidden potential to prepare the future generation to become leaders, not corporate slaves.
Essay 165:
The curriculum for schools has become a matter of great concern as it directly influences the quality of education. Some people opine that academies should focus on job-oriented subjects that prepare pupils for a good career whereas others think that learners should be cognizant of their ancient path, tradition and heritage through learning arts and history besides their career preparation. This essay argues why it is necessary to emphasise traditional subjects, which are just as important as employment-oriented skills.
Many schools primarily concentrate on subjects that help students improve their skills and get ready for jobs. This is mainly due to the present competitive world where people face cut-throat competition in securing a job. So people assume that developing practical skills from a younger age will help students perform well in professional life. For instance, some schools in India have adopted certain subjects that focus mainly on attaining a medical degree and thereby become a better physician in the future.
However, it is essential for students to learn history, arts and similar subjects along with skill-oriented materials. Knowledge of culture and history allows students to become leaders than becoming corporate robots. For instance, the contribution of an explorer, leader and social worker is no less than that of a doctor or an engineer.
In conclusion, the primary objective of education is to prepare the young generation to build a better world through their diverse contributions, not just become money-making machines. This is why arts and history are just as important as skill-related subjects in the national education curriculum.
Essay 167:
E-commerce has revolutionised the way people do business and purchase products and get different services. With billions of Internet users, online shopping is no longer a theory, but a reality, and it has changed people’s lifestyle and buying habits to a great extent. With the exception of a few disadvantages, online shopping has tremendous benefits and it will dominate global business even more in the coming days to make people’s life easier.
To begin with, online shopping enables consumers to get a service or a product from home. They no longer need to travel a long distance or wait in a long queue to pay their bills or withdraw cash. With the widespread use of hand-held smart devices and the Internet, shopping is just a few finger taps away. This saves valuable times and enables people to use plastic cards which is more secure. Moreover, online banking, ticket booking system, e-payment and online subscriptions facilitate mass people to avoid traffic congestion and help maintain a green environment. From a business owner’s perspective, online shopping permits them to run the business 24x7 and without the need for any extra staff, utility bills and so on. This permits them to offer products at a more competitive price.
Furthermore, consumers enjoy great freedom to purchase global products from renowned websites like eBay and Amazon and compare the quality and price of a product before making a purchasing decision. Perhaps the most noticeable benefit of this trend is the unparalleled opportunity it has brought for ordinary people to open their own online shops and run small businesses online. This would never have happened without the growth of online business trends.
Among the drawbacks of online shopping, identity theft and digital scams are more common. Careless use of a credit card or sensitive personal information can often invite intruders and hackers to harm someone. Finally, online shopping does not allow someone to physically inspect a product before buying it and this often leads to customer dissatisfaction. However, these demerits can easily be avoided by being cautious and relying on reputed brands.
To conclude, the overwhelming benefits that online shopping offer far outweigh a few demerits it has. I personally am an online shopper and I believe that this has immensely improved our freedom of shopping and lifestyle.
Essay 169:
Many young students drop out of schools, sometimes to earn to support their families and sometimes due to other reasons, and this has a severe consequence to their future and society. Sometimes those students are to be blamed, but oftentimes, the system is responsible for it. The state should revise the way it runs schools and arranges re-schooling facilities while the school authority should provide some paid jobs to needy students to mend this situation.
To begin with, many young pupils leaves schools without completing their education mainly to earn a wage to support their families, and this is more common in developing countries. According to a recent report, more than 30% of students leave schools in South Asian countries due to financial hindrance. The government in such a country should focus on developing the conditions of parents who have school-going offspring. Education should be free, and some subsidies should be provided to poor students. Besides, the government's initiatives to create more jobs would also improve this situation. However, the greatest step the government can take is arranging re-schooling facilities for those disarrayed pupils with some incentives and job provisions.
Moreover, the school authority should make education more fun in school to retain young students. For instance, some Japanese schools use interactive and fun methods to teach young minds, and this has increased students’ school attendance dramatically. Such initiatives should be welcomed and more widely used. Besides, the school authority can arrange some clerical jobs for needy students to help them continue their studies.
To conclude, education is the most important pillar for the development of a nation and the state and school authority should help students stay in schools and finish their academic years. Without having an educated nation, crime and unemployment would skyrocket to push society to complete chaos.
Essay 170:
Education can change the fate of a nation, and educated citizens are the most important resources that a country can have. When a country has a large number of school dropouts, it struggles to develop, and it affects society negatively. The state must take necessary initiatives to improve the situation by encouraging young students to finish their education and establish enough night schools for working-class young people who want to continue their education.
To begin with, young students often find it hard to continue their education either for their financial conditions or for their lack of interests in schools, and oftentimes, for both. To help them continue their education, the government must adopt a policy to support their families financially. Incentives should be given both to needy families and to meritorious poor students. School authority, along with the support from the government, can implement it to improve the situation. For instance, free-education and scholarship policies adopted by the authority in many Asian and African countries have reduced their illiteracy rate significantly over the years, and it has improved their employment and social conditions.
Furthermore, education has to be interactive and fun for young students so that they enjoy going to school. A friendly school environment, sports and entertainment facilities, delicious and healthy meals, and support from teachers can be crucial factors to attach students to their school activities. Surveys reveal that when learners show interests to continue their schools, parents try their best to support the costs. Finally, the government should build many night schools so that young students who have not finished their education get a chance to continue their education. Those schools are vital to give school-leavers a second chance to improve their qualification while also keep them away from activities that are subversive for society.
In conclusion, when young students leave schools prematurely, it not only affects their future but also the whole society. To reverse this unfortunate situation, the government and schools authorities are expected to work together. Only then we can expect the true progress of our nation.
Essay 172:
With the ever-increasing competitions and demands in life, a child’s family, school and society, as a whole, expect too much from the child. While it is important to excel in schools, sports, social activities and in other aspects of life, those children should be shielded from the mounting pressures by maintaining a balance in their life. Otherwise, the expectation would act as a boomerang and hamper the development of a child.
The world has become far more competitive than ever before. For instance, I did not have to compete with anyone to get admitted to my primary school but my nephew had to take an entrance exam to get enrolled in the same school, and just one in every twelve applicants was successful. Besides, we had plenty of time to enjoy in schools while this is different for today's young pupils. They attend classes, take extra coaching, go to music and art schools and read many books and all these activities are meant to fulfil their parents' dream and school's expectations. Parents want their children to be top scorers in school, math geniuses, as well as great soccer players and renowned artists. The problem is that it is not a rational and practical expectation. Moreover, the commercialisation of products which targets young children is another problem we need to address.  
We have to draw a line in our expectations and find out the true potentials of a child rather than pushing them constantly. The state should discourage having an entrance exam in elementary school and have sufficient funds to ensure proper entertainment and sports facilities in academies. Teachers should not pressurize children to do homework every day, and they should try to make school a place to learn in a fun way. Furthermore, social perspectives to prepare every boy or girl to become a doctor, engineer or a higher-wage-earning professional should change.
To conclude, children today are being pushed beyond their limits to achieve academic, social and professional success, and this has unfathomable negative consequences. Parents and teachers should find the hidden talent of a child, not try to make them something they are not meant to be.
Essay 174:
Developing a sense of discipline among children is an important responsibility for parents as it determines a child’s future and the overall social condition. However, many parents can not share quality time with their children due to career pressure and those couples, oftentimes, fail to teach children moral values. This has undeniably lead to some juvenile delinquencies including disciplinary problems. I firmly believe that parents should spend more time with their offsprings and teach them through examples to reverse this trend.
To begin with, when children, as a whole, in a society, become disruptive, they are not the ones to be blamed. Parents are the first teachers and perhaps the most reliable ones in times of a child’s joy and vulnerability, and they have to spend time with their children. Ideal parents teach their children good rules and set examples to meet the expectation of parenthood. Lessons learned from parents shape a child’s character and this is why psychologists emphasize so much on good parenting. Career and social status are important, but not more than the future of a child and this is why parents should maintain a balance in their professional and family life.
Once a child becomes rogue, the parents are the persons to suffer the most. Due to the relationship between upbringing and the future of a child, fathers and mothers should instil good moral values in a child in the early stage of their life, not regret when it is already too late.
To conclude, many parents leave their children on their own only to miss their chance to make them ideal citizens of the society. No matter how alluring the career prospects are, good parents should always make time to share with their boys and girls and teach them important lessons about life, including the importance of discipline.
Essay 176:
Technology, globalization, tourism and open trade policy have brought nations together and some people dream to have a world with no cultural and communication barriers. The expert opinion of having a new single international language for all nations thus has developed. Despite its appeal, I believe that it would be a futile step as the world already has an international language- English.
The increasing conglomeration of nations, the upsurge of globalisation and the widespread use of modern technology have tremendously increased people’s need to communicate with each other and thus some linguistics express their view on introducing a new global language. However, the real picture is quite different from the expectation as linguistics have already failed to establish an artificially formed universal language despite their efforts and arguments several times.
Moreover, English, the most widely used language for international communication, is already in place and has many rich features. Besides, some people use other international languages like Spanish and French, and except some culturally biased people, all have accepted English as their mean to communicate with people from other countries. This model is already working pretty well and the idea of patching an already functional system would add more distresses.
Over the last millennia, English as an international language has already infiltrated the territories due to geopolitical reasons and cultural encouragements. A language is not merely a collection of letters and words; rather it is a result of the evolution of society, constant research and experience of mass people. Thus no matter how easy the newly introduced language is made, it will lack the fundamental quality of a rich language. People in favour of presenting a new global language often opine that the new language would be culturally neutral and morally correct to be the common linguistic ground for still divided humanity. As fair as it may sound, such an opinion lacks rationality. English is already doing fine and inventing a new language and having it functional would bring unnecessary distress and effort, and it will more likely fail as it did in the past.
To conclude, the world needs a unified language for many reasons but introducing a new one is the least ideal solution of all. The natural flow of English as a global language has already filled the gap and we no longer need to add unnecessary misery to people to experiment with a seemingly ineffective idea.
Essay 178:
Traditionally people get married to someone of the same culture, religion and country. But marrying in a different culture has become common and socially accepted these days. Technological advancements, changes in social belief, and freedom for choosing a life partner among young have accelerated this trend and many of these cross-cultural marriages indeed are working too well.
To begin with, people, these days, use technology to make friends across the border. An increasing number of people also study abroad and live in a cross-cultural environment. This has broken their outdated social belief to a great extent, and they have a broader perspective of life and marriage. Moreover, young people have greater freedoms in choosing their life partners unlike in the past when parents primarily picked a bride or bridegroom for someone. Modern society also seems to have accepted this freedom and welcome marriage beyond the known boundary.
Cross-cultural marriage has several benefits. People have different inherent features and strength based on their culture, race, geographic location and family and it is often noticed that children of such cross-cultural couples are stronger and have diverse capabilities. Two people from totally different cultures, when get married, take time to understand each other and this often strengthens their conjugal relationship. They learn about other’s tradition, culture, belief, language and this opens up an entirely new world for them. Such marriage often teaches people to become more tolerant of other races, culture and custom and it often helps people to discover themselves from a neutral point of view rather than the biased view of inherent culture and tradition.
This type of marriage has some disadvantages too. Family, friends and relatives often have misconceptions of such couples and keep their distance. Mixed marriages often force people to accept an alien way of life that they cannot completely cope with. Children in such families often find it hard to adhere to a particular culture and end up adopting a pseudo-cultural identity. Finally, such marriage often ends in a bitter experience as couples fail to understand each other properly.
To conclude, mix-cultural marriages are nowadays more accepted in our society than in the past. Social changes, technology and people’s freedom to choose a life partner have greatly made it possible. Despite some problems, this type of marriage is working too well to consider it a mainstream trend.
Essay 180:
Differences between nations in terms of their lifestyle, food habit, fashion, choices and traditions have already reduced to a great extent with the effects of globalisation, technology and international agreements for open trade facilities. Since most of the international products are easily accessible globally, people have far more choices and freedom which have enhanced people's lifestyle besides narrowing the gaps among nations. I postulate this trend as a positive development and the reasons are explained in this essay.
To begin with, the availability of international brands like Apple, Google, Nike, Pepsi, Johnson's, Samsung, Nestle, Unilever, Amazon, Toyota etc. in a country enables consumers to purchase quality products. For instance, someone in India can use the same technological products from Intel and Microsoft that an American uses and it facilitates reducing gaps between these two countries. 'Barrier & gaps' among nations was a predominant reason for conflicts and with the advancement of technology and mutual trade agreements, nations now know about the foreign cultures more than they did ever before. This diminishes the world tension and helps prevail the peace. Furthermore, affluent countries have created a vast market for consumer products and this has helped them establish offshore offices and factories in developing nations. This is a mutually beneficial agreement that helps both parties.
Furthermore, local consumers are not trapped with the low-quality local products and wider freedom lets them enjoy a better lifestyle. With the competition, local manufacturers are forced to produce quality products at a competitive price. With this development, some local companies have gained international recognition as a manufacturer.
To conclude, barriers and gaps among nations divide people and create a master-slave relationship as we have already witnessed in history. The present era has plummeted this heinous trend to a great extent and the similar lifestyle and availability of international products have helped this to happen.
Essay 182:
How much freedom should be granted to children on everyday matters is controversial. People who are against allowing boundless liberty to children believe that it would create selfish individuals in our society. Others, however, think freedom is necessary to nurture the creativity of children and it creates self-reliant individuals. I believe that parents should neither give absolute privilege to their children nor restrain them in every matter - there must be a balance.
On the one hand, permitting children to do whatever they want and letting them chose everything they like would convince youngsters that they can do whatever they like. This is detrimental to the mental growth of children and those children would likely become selfish and self-centred when they grow up. Scientific research reveals that someone’s childhood experience has a permanent effect on his personality and thinking pattern. This is why parents should make important decisions for their offsprings and deter them from doing things that are harmful to their psychological and physical growth as well as for others.
On the other hand, psychologists express that if parents do not allow their children to pick certain things on their own and restrict them on everything, the children would become fragile-minded and definitely lack confidence. If children cannot choose things they like and do not have any freedom of choice, would end up being less creative than those who were given the freedom to make their own decisions.
To conclude, our society needs more creative and selfless people and that is why we should allow freedom to our child, but there should be a boundary between this liberty and freedom of choice. The balance can bring the best possible results.
Essay 184:
People, in some countries, prefer to have a fast and extensive rail transportation system while others think that improving the existing road transportation system is far more important and that is why more budget should be spent on roads. This essay discusses both views. Personally, I am in favour of developing and enhancing both.
On the one hand, people in favour of having a speedy and reliable train communication system mainly base their ground on the fact that trains can carry a large number of passengers and goods at a time and can remarkably reduce traffic congestion. Rail communication is safer, faster and can connect cities and towns that build a better connection than the conventional road transport system, according to these people. Furthermore, locomotives are already famous in many countries and have greatly improved communications there. Due to such advantages, people often opine that more money should be allocated for constructing new fast train lines. For instance, the train system in China and Russia both have a groundbreaking contribution to improving their overall communication systems and many countries have started adopting this model.
On the other hand, the public transport system plays an essential role in interconnecting the different parts of the cities and most people use this system to travel to different places. Though trains can improve the city transport facilities, it is not an alternative to the existing road transports. That is why many people believe that the national budget should be utilised on improving public transport for the sake of better communication for mass people. For instance, the train line in the UK has always contributed to a great extent to the overall transport system in the country. Nevertheless, public transport has always been the main commuting mode for UK citizens.
To conclude, I believe that the national budget should be fairly distributed for the improvement of the fast and new rail system as well as public transports for the overall expansion and improvement of the transportation system in a country.
Essay 186:
The education system, in most of the countries, is mainly supported by the government while private schools are expensive as private organisations maintain them. Some people opine that parents who send their children to private schools should be exempted from paying tax for state education. I, however, disagree with this proposed policy.
First of all, the government does not force people to send their children to private schools. When people decide to send their children to private schools, they accept the higher fee willingly. From a practical point of view, affluent citizens send their children to private schools, and they are higher taxpayers. If they do not support state education, the government would have a hard time managing the state-supported education system. Besides, a double standard in tax would create an outcry among the populace. Secondly, all citizens should spontaneously pay the education tax to fulfil their duty to the country. The money collected through tax is used to run the education system of the country, and that is why taxpayers have a natural obligation to contribute to the state-run education system.
Finally, not all citizens utilise the services provided to the public by the taxpayers' money. For instance, many city-dwellers always turn to private health care services despite they pay taxes for the state-owned medical facilities. This is why dual tax policy for individuals who send their offspring to a private school would deteriorate the whole tax collecting system.
In conclusion, I strongly support that every eligible citizen, no matter whether they send their children to public or private schools, should pay the tax. This is the best way to keep education free for poor parents and affordable for middle-class people.
Essay 188:
Cities offer many conveniences and opportunities that are not present in rural areas, but these things do not come without a cost. Higher living costs, pollutions, loosely relationship among people and frantic competition often make cities difficult to live in. The government has a lot to do to improve the lifestyle of the city dwellers.
The overwhelming expense is the main problem for anyone who moves to a city from a small town. The cost of education, treatment, house rent, food and daily commodities are far higher in a city. Pollution in cities is the second most severe issue and it makes metropolitan areas less suitable for children to grow up. People in big cities live in a contaminated area where the CO2 emission, the presence of carbon and other toxic elements in the air is higher. Another drawback of living in a city is the social classification and gap between rich and poor. Social discriminations in city areas are far higher than in the other parts of the country.
Moreover, people in small towns and villages have an exceptional connection and they know each other very well, which is quite the opposite in a city. Moreover, municipal life is full of competition and it makes people’s life miserable. Someone has to compete to get in a public car, wait for his turn to meet the doctor, wait several hours in the traffic jam and fight hard to get a decent job. The competition is so high that even a child has to go through a tough fight to be accepted into a school.   
I believe there are many steps that a government can take to tackle these issues. Firstly, the government should control the prices of the daily commodities and build more high rising buildings to reduce the house rent. More public buses with better facilities should be introduced to reduce traffic jam. Decentralisation and the development of the provincial towns would let the authorities shift many industries to these regions and thus reduce the pressure on the cities and metropolitan areas.
In conclusion, the government should take initiatives to improve people's living standard in cities and make sure rural areas and towns have plenty of job opportunities to reduce the pressure on big cities.
Essay 190:
Waste recycling is a widely discussed issue around the globe, but even after numerous global initiatives and continuous announcements, people seem to react whimsically to this. Many opine that people tend to abide by something only when there are rules and legal obligations. This is why waste recycling should be made a law and mandatory to adhere to, in my opinion.
To begin with, waste recycling help save the environment and the process reuses many valuable materials. Some household garbage contains detrimental ingredients and can cause harm to the environment. If every homeowner takes the responsibility to participate in waste recycling, waste management as well as preserving a green environment would become easier. However, this is not the case and many people still ignore this. Thus comes the question of whether making it a law would force people to participate more and save the environment. I strongly believe this will.
Naturally, people have a tendency to ignore many important tasks - be it for themselves or society as a whole. They are sometimes as careless as crossing the busy streets instead of taking the overpass or underpass, though the latter one is safer. On the contrary, when legal obligations and punishment for an act are in place, the number of participants seems like increases dramatically. For instance, when crossing busy streets instead of using the underpass in some cities have been made a legal offence, the number of road accidents decreased significantly over time. Similarly, when the government would make recycling mandatory by imposing laws, people would participate more in this. This is so sensitive an issue that this should have already been a part of the law.
In fact, the main objective of the law is to deter people from doing something bad and punish offenders to maintain a peaceful society. Since waste recycling is directly related to our environment and the well-being of our future generation, we should make it a legal responsibility so that people do not ignore this important task.
In conclusion, law and rules exist to encourage and somewhat force people to follow the good trends and avoid bad practices. Since people are not spontaneously participating in waste recycling and the amount of garbage they produce is increasing, the government must have defined rules and legislation to control it for the benefit of all.
Essay 192:
The proportion of elderly people in some countries, like Japan, is considerably higher while in some other regions, including some Asian and Western countries, young people comprise the highest percentage of the total population. Having a larger proportion of youth is considered to have more advantages for a country, and I think that a country should have more active youths for faster development.
To begin with, the young generation is dynamic, energetic, and can contribute to the job sector which has a huge positive impact on the economic development of the country. They come with fresh ideas and are free from old superstitions and traditional beliefs. It gives them a competitive advantage. The educated young generation is the best resource a country can have, and their contribution to the country is significantly higher than the participation of children and elder people. The contribution of the older people, however, could not be denied and they have already done their part for reforming the country. They have vast experience and wisdom that are vital for decision making. They are often considered a better fit for the decision-making positions.
Moreover, children are the future of a country, and the elderly have already played their roles. On the contrary, the young generation is the active workforce and can lead to the overall growth of the country. They are active citizens in society while children and senior peoples are dependent on others. The young generation can learn things faster and can share ideas, and this is why they are better leaders. The ICT sector, for instance, is full of fresh minds and is globally led by young minds. The ICT sector is considered to be the most prominent sector for the development of a country, especially in this technological era, and it highlights the importance of young and fresh minds over elder people in a country.
To conclude, older people should not be considered a burden for the country, however, the young have more to contribute to society and the country as a whole. This is why it is more beneficial for a country to have an active workforce than dependent senior citizens.
Essay 194:
Fish population in seas, lakes and rivers are falling sharply and over-fishing is the main reason for this. Many Asian and European countries had plenty of fish species, but these days many fish species have become numbered. Overall, this has terrible impacts. Without imposing strict laws to stop uncontrolled fishing, while also investing money in improving the natural habitats of fishes, we will bear great losses.
Fishes, in many parts of the world, are caught early and they do not get time to grow and reproduce. Without the government’s initiatives and proper policy, the condition will deteriorate as the greedy fishers would not spare any fish from their nets. As a consequence, marine life would lose its balance and many fish species would get extinct. To prevent it, the government must have strong surveillance to stop catching baby fishes.
As a direct result of over-fishing, many popular fish species have become very expensive and rare. For instance, Hilsha, the national fish of Bangladesh, is facing an acute threat of over-fishing and have become numbered. This has a negative economic impact as the country used to export this fish to many western countries. Besides, due to the exhaustive and indiscriminating fishing, many rivers, lakes and canals are void of fishes and more fishermen are finding it hard to live by fishing. Many governments have already taken steps by declaring many rivers, sea areas and canals restricted and marking commercial fishing prohibited in certain seasons, and this is making the livelihood of many fishermen even harder.
In conclusion, over-fishing must be stopped now and the government must decide to bring changes to save fish species. Besides, the population who live by fishing must also fish prudently and always spare the baby and mother fishes for their own benefit.
Essay 196:
Globalisation is sweeping away all the differences and boundaries among nations. The buzzword globalisation refers to the freeing up of markets, free flow of goods and information and as a result, the traditional barriers among nations are gradually breaking down and the world is becoming closer in terms of cultural and economic relations. So, I believe that, as a natural process, the culture of different countries are blending together and a country is adopting foreign cultures faster than ever.
These days some countries are experiencing rapid cultural changes and the culture of a dominating country is being adopted by the people of other countries. For instance, due to the spread of Indian TV channels and their Bombay-centric flamboyant Hindi cultures, many SAARC countries are on the verge of losing their century-old cultural uniqueness in the films and fashion industries. Interestingly, Indian culture is also being influenced by more dominating Hollywood.
Moreover, in the age of globalisation, countries are seeking greater cooperation and the spirit is a greater flow of commodities, information and people across the borders of different countries. Mass media and technology have played an even greater role in promoting the norm of globalisation and people these days are aware of the cultural presence of other countries. The tourist influx in different countries is creating a mixed cultural global village where no country is unique, rather they all have a mixed culture.
Some people treat this as a natural process while others take it as a threat to their own cultural identity. I believe that cultures are dynamic and living phenomena. Culture, what we know today, was different in the past and that is why we should not be too much wary of changes. Even before globalisation swept in, we started celebrating the 31st December and Valentine’s Day, which is completely foreign to our culture. This is the era of free information exchange and if we stop international cooperation for the sake of our cultural identity, our progress would stop overnight.
In conclusion, free trade and the global market is such a powerful concept that it cannot be stopped anymore. Keeping the window of progress is better than keeping them close even if this means inheriting foreign cultures.
Essay 198:
Some environmental problems are regional like cyclones, and some others are global - greenhouse effects, for instance. With the span of time, many environmental problems are becoming global issues, and I believe that global initiatives will bring the best result. It will also make the world a better place to live in.
To begin with, environmental problems are generally caused by humans and while some of them are national in nature, most of them are global issues. Noise or water pollution at a time remain national problems but after a certain period, it would turn into a problem for the whole world. Thus if some environmental problems are left unaddressed due to its span in a country, it would soon become a problem for all nations.
Moreover, not all nations are equally qualified to address issues of such magnitude due to their economic and political aspects and this is why other affluent nations should extend their helping hands to solve such problems. Rich nations cause more global warming and this is why they need to build a common platform to bring all nations together to fight environmental problems. For a poor country, it is quite tough to allocate a budget for saving the greenery while millions of its population are suffering from hunger and natural disaster. This is why other rich nations have natural obligations to help those poor or developing nations.
To draw the conclusion, global environmental problems like greenhouse effects, global warming etc. have already become a concern for every nation. A collaborative effort to address these problems would be a better strategy as each nation is not equally adept to solve global problems.
Environmental problems greatly vary in terms of their magnitudes, and some of these are local, while others are definitely global in nature - the greenhouse effect or global warming for example. For the best result, these sort of problems should be addressed at the most appropriate levels, sometimes even at multiple levels.
To begin with, some environmental problems are generally caused by a group of people in a particular region and these issues get accelerated by the rapid expansion of industrialisation in this region. These sorts of problems often include noise pollution, air pollution, deforestation, intoxicating waste disposal etc. and these are generally national in nature. It is better to address these types of environmental problems at the national level and educating people is a viable solution in this scenario. International aid sometimes can help a poor or developing country to address environmental problems but the government of the country should take initiatives to solve such national problems.
Having said that, some environmental problems, for instance, common river, coastline or sea pollution concerns more than one countries and those sorts of problems should be addressed at a bilateral level. Similarly, if an environmental problem concerns a large region, for instance, a continent, that should be discussed and fought by the countries that are located on this continent. Some common examples of this type of environmental problems are desertification, soil erosion, aridness and floods.  
Finally, some environmental problems pervade across national boundaries and calls for multinational or global collaboration. For example, radioactive industrial wastages in oceans, ozone layer degradation, global warming are global issues and these types of problems should be addressed by every single nation in the world. For greater success and effectiveness, I believe that the commitment of countries, especially rich nations, is quite important.
To conclude, environmental problems should be viewed as a common problem for mankind and those global problems should be endorsed and shared globally by all nations. Similarly, rich nationals should help developing nations to fight their regional and national environmental problems for the best result.
Essay 200:
In recent years, many schools have included technology-related subjects while dropped traditional subjects from the school syllabus. Whether old subjects should be replaced by modern ones is a matter of great debate. I believe it is a difficult question to answer, and different schools should adopt different solutions.
Some believe that traditional subjects should be retained as part of the school curriculum as they have great values for the students. According to them, school education is not merely a process to ensure a future job. This is rather a broader aspect, and to build an enlightened future generation, we need more cultural and arts-related subjects than technical ones. Another group of people believe that technical subjects are more important than arts and sports-related subjects as they not only ensure better learning for students but guarantee jobs in the future also. From a more practical point of view, technical knowledge is more important in life, and this is why many people and guardians support the change in the school curriculum.
I personally believe that the school curriculum should be changed from time to time to make it more suitable for the latest trend. This, however, does not mean that we drop cultural and art-related subjects from our school. While the place for the new subjects should be made, old and important subjects should also be part of the national curriculum. I also think that the changes in school curriculum often create some difficulties for the students and teachers but if effective measures are taken, that should not be a big dilemma. Sometimes the change comes all of a sudden and learners do not have a clue what to do. The school authorities, in this case, should play an important role to support the learners.
In conclusion, the school curriculum is a sensitive issue, and that should be very carefully planned. Modern subjects should be introduced, no doubt, but this should not make the traditional and old subjects obsolete.
Essay 202:
These days we no longer completely rely on locally grown food as we can now purchase food grown in some distant land whenever we want. Though this trend has some benefits as it widens our freedom as consumers, it has some severe disadvantages which makes it a dangerous trend.
We live in a global village, and with the introduction of the speedy transportation system, food grown anywhere could be transported to other parts of the world. It ensures that people can buy many types of local and foreign fruits, vegetables and other food items from the nearby markets. "If something is not locally grown, import it" - globalisation has made it a reality. It also fosters international trade, helps many farmers reach the international market and help countries fight their food scarcity. However, this does not come without a price.
The transportation of food requires burning more fuel, and this is detrimental to the environment. Just to supply internationally grown fruits, we are degrading our environment. This is a price we cannot afford to pay. Another negative impact of transporting food is putting the local farmers into the competition, and they are forced to produce more items at a lower cost and hence the increasing use of chemicals. This, in a way, is declining the quality of locally grown food items.
Furthermore, consumers are often forced to purchase imported food that was preserved and produced with the use of chemicals and preservatives. They are harmful to our health, and people are purchasing those items at a higher price. Importers cannot ensure the freshness and proper nutrition of imported food. Local sellers also preserve them for several days. This makes it less nutritious and less fresh than the locally produced fruits and vegetables.
In conclusion, I believe that transporting food over a long distance is undesirable and have more negative consequences than positive ones. It threatens our local farmers and chemically preserved fruits and vegetables that are being imported is not a healthy choice at all.
Essay 204:
Youth drug abuse is perhaps the most wicked and concerning issue both the poor and rich nations suffer equally. Many young talents are wasted and families destroyed due to drug abuse. Not only the illegal drugs are being misused, but also the youth's experiment with illegal substances are on the rise. Suggesting accurate remedies for that problem requires a clear understanding of the underlying reasons and this essay will attempt it.
To note down the possible reasons for youth drug abuse, we need to consider the availability of these drugs and many corrupted law officers first. According to several news reports and investigations, the law-enforcing department has a list of all drug dealers and possible spots where illegal drugs are sold. If this is the case, why they are yet to wipe out the illegal drug business from the city is a big question! No doubt, money and corruption play a role here. Besides, some people say that family bonding in modern life is not as close as it used to be. Due to family issues and pressure, many young people start abusing drugs. Initially, they find it a relief but soon get trapped. Thirdly, the lack of proper counselling and teenagers curiosity drive many of them to try new drugs. Bad companies who are on drugs can influence many youths to start it. Finally, public advertisements, magazines and movies that depict smoking and drinking positively can attract young minds. They often try to mimic their favourite actors and this is just the beginning that ends in substance-abusing.
Personally, I would like to suggest that the authority should try to wipe out the illegal drug businesses from the country. If the illegal drug business is closed, teenagers would not be curious to try them. Another way to tackle this issue is by having better family bonding and parents spending quality time with their children. Finally, all sorts of public advertisement for tobacco or alcohol should be completely banned.
To conclude, hopefully, the day not far away when we will have no young drug abuser in our society and this can be achieved by us - as a parent, as a teacher, as a friend and finally as a law-enforcing officer. If we play our roles properly, we will have a better society, which is free of any illegal drugs and drug addicts.
Essay 206:
After getting admitted to a university, students need to decide where to live, and this choice severely affects their academic performance and student life. While many disciples choose university halls, others opt to live in an apartment, and it has both benefits and demerits. This essay examines both advantages and disadvantages of living in a separate apartment than living in a university residence. Personally, I would prefer to live in a university residence.
Living in an apartment offers many distinct advantages, and privacy is one of them. While a student in a dormitory has little privacy, someone in an apartment enjoys far better privacy and freedom. Learners who live in an independent house can choose a quiet neighbourhood, and this environment is conducive for studying attentively. Furthermore, living in an apartment makes students more independent, and they can choose a better diet. For instance, one of my cousins moved to an apartment after living in a university dormitory for about six months, and he did so because he hated the food offered in his university canteen.
Having said that, living in an apartment rather than a university dormitory has some visible disadvantages. First and foremost is the cost. In my country, living in an apartment is quite expensive while the university offers cheap accommodation. The food is also cheaper in the university dining halls. Second, renting an apartment in my city is hard for a student. The landlords prefer families over the students. Furthermore, the daily commuting is convenient from the university halls while not so easy from the apartments away from the university campus. Finally, campus staying students have better interaction with seniors and teachers.
In conclusion, even though there are many benefits of living in an apartment than living in a university hall, I would still prefer to live in the university dormitory. The primary reason for me to be able to attend my classes without commuting through bad traffics. I hate to wait in the heavy traffic and as I do not own a car. I would also like to enjoy my university life and stay in touch with my seniors, teachers and classmates whenever possible. University life has so many things to offer, and I do not want to miss them.
Essay 208:
The world already has an unendurable population and the highest percentages of them live in Asia and Africa. Poverty, corruption, pollution and diseases are epidemic in these parts of the world and the higher populace is the main reason for it. If the population in these two continents are not controlled, the problems would completely get out of hand and this essay suggests some ways of curbing the expansion of the population.
The terribly higher population density, poverty, unemployment and other social problems have already made it tough for Asian and African countries to progress and the increasing population growth makes the future even more uncertain there. Higher population in some developed countries are seen as a blessing while it is not the case in most of the Asian and African countries as most of their citizens are uneducated and unskilled.
To control the population, the first step has to come from the government. The authority should restrict the number of children a family can have, and violation of this policy should be severely punished. Countries like China have already adopted this policy and have been able to control their population to a certain extent. Besides, the citizens have to realise the negative effects of the uncontrolled population and spontaneously take birth control measures. Without the support of the ordinary population, the government alone cannot control it. Above all, international organisations like WHO, UNDP and other humanitarian organisation should work in these countries to educate people about the negative consequences of the higher population growth. Besides, they should provide funds for birth control in these countries.
In conclusion, the higher population in poor countries is a big threat, and, oftentimes, the main hindrance to true progress. The government, ordinary people and international organisations should work together to control the rapid population growth in these countries. Without a combination of policy, awareness and a free flow of funds, it would be impossible to help those countries control their population.
Essay 209:
The population growth in the world has already gone out of control, and it is more daunting in most Asian and African countries. The population growth in these regions is uncontrollable due to ignorance, poor quality of life, and the religious and social taboo against population control. In this essay, I will briefly suggest some issues that overpopulation causes, and then suggest some ways to control it.
Overpopulation causes a complex set of problems that negatively affects the quality of life. It also increases crime, pollution and corruption. Increasing population creates more pressure on the already limited resources in the poor and developing countries and an upsurge in population will simply make the situation worse. Unemployment, inadequate infrastructure, poverty, malnutrition, low literacy rates and high competition already make the citizens suffer a lot, and if the population growth is not controlled, it will make things worse day by day.
Controlling the population in a country can not be achieved overnight, and despite initiatives and educational campaigns, the result might come at a slow pace. However, proper steps should be taken to control the rapid expansion of the population. First, the authority should take initiatives and launch awareness campaigns more frequently, especially among the poor citizens, to educate them about the negative consequences of having many children. Making contraceptives available for free among the poor population should be ensured. Finally, the government must impose laws to restrict the number of children a family can have. For instance, families in China are not allowed to have more than one child, and any violation of it incites financial penalty. This may seem cruel at first but the one-child policy has already given positive outcomes to many populous countries.
In conclusion, if the population keeps increasing at the current rate, the world would soon find itself in the verse of war for food, shelter and medicine. So the time has come to take every possible step to tackle the heinous speed of population growth, and authorities and citizens should work together to tackle it.
Essay 211:
Developing countries have great potentials to accelerate their progress, and they want to achieve it faster, even if it means that they need to shift their economic focus. Though it is not accepted by all that a country can develop if it focuses on expanding industries rather than agriculture, I personally believe that a developing country like Bangladesh should have a well-conceived industrialisation strategy like Japan, China or Hong Kong to become a developed country.
Agriculture, undeniably, is an important sector for a country like Bangladesh where more than 70% of people rely on it. However,  agriculture alone cannot enlist a country as an advanced nation in this modern era. The industrial revolution has taught us that manual labour and agricultural products cannot singly improve the economic condition of a nation. And a country must have an export-oriented industry or great industrial hub to progress quickly. For instance, a poor country has to export several hundreds of tonnes of grains to import only a few numbers of modern machinery. This disparity will keep on enhancing if the nation cannot become industrially sufficient. Asian economy has already shifted from farming and fishing to industrialisation and no developing country can further progress without following the same pathway, as the research suggests.
While agricultural development should not be ignored, especially in countries like Bangladesh, industrialisation should get more priority. Diversifying the agricultural products and exports is a great power for an agricultural-based country, but this takes a long way to reach the top and with the revolution and rapid expansion of the industrial world, this has become quite challenging, in a practical world.
To conclude, an agriculture-dependent country like Bangladesh should try to diversify its agricultural sector to become self-sufficient in its food supply but must have a long-term industrial strategy to progress and become a developed nation.
Essay 213:
For more than a century, traditional examination to assess student’s ability was in place and this is still in use in many parts of the world. However, a more suitable and modern approach has been adopted by many schools, and this is often regarded as a better technique to evaluate a pupil’s learning ability and knowledge. I personally believe that the innovative modern assessment technique is more suitable.
To begin with, the conventional exam system has a major flaw which is its inadequacy to evaluate the true knowledge of pupils. For instance, in the conventional paper-based exam system, students can memorise answers to a few questions and pass the exam with a good grade. Someone with little knowledge of a subject can get a higher grade by memorising answers. On the contrary, innovative approaches like group assignments, sudden quiz, hands-on tests etc. can reflect the actual level of student’s learning. This is why many educational institutions are shifting towards these assessment techniques from the traditional exam system and I really believe that this will, in the future, become the main evaluation technique in schools.
Moreover, the paper-based exam system allows students to cheat the exam and pass it without even studying hard. On the contrary, a student would not be able to pass a hands-on test or an open-book exam where he needs to propose a solution to a problem rather than writing answers from books. From my experience, I can tell that I had to study more to pass the sudden class tests than my term-finals as I had no clue what teachers would assess on these sudden tests. Many schools have already introduced a few innovative assessment techniques due to their experience from the traditional tests and their limitations. The latest methods are in place because they are more suitable.
To conclude, the right technique to evaluate students is an important issue, and no stone should be unturned to introduce the most effective way of doing it. Something is missing in the conventional exam system, and I believe this is where the modern methods of evaluating fits in.
Essay 214:
A change in the student evaluation process could be observed in the last two decades and formal examination has been less frequently used in many educational institutions in different parts of the world. The result of the paper-based exam, though used extensively in many schools, is believed to be less suitable for assessing the ability of learners, and I believe that it should be replaced by the modern approaches of assessment.
To begin with, formal examinations, in many cases, do not reflect a pupil’s true ability and knowledge. Examination or any assessment criteria is meant to scrutinize a student objectively, but a formal test fails to do it, especially because it involved memorise-and-pass technique. Further, formal exams do not consider someone’s health condition on the exam date and thus is unsuitable for many. Some students take more time to produce any result and though they take a longer time, they have a better result in producing capability. Traditional exams would also score these sorts of students poorly.
On the other hand, the unconventional assessment systems to test a student’s skill and knowledge can be quite effective and bring out a better result. For instance, oral presentation, assignments, sudden quizzes, class tests, course work, and other modern methods of evaluation can examine students from various perspectives and when the result is combined, the indication is far more accurate. These tests scrutinise a learner’s creativity, depth of knowledge, creativity, ability to use the knowledge in the practical world, and are important parameters of a student’s reasoning and reflection of learning ability.
In conclusion, evaluating a learner accurately is important and the best method for this should be in place. No doubt the formal examination system had been used for a long but the time has come to adopt a more accurate and practical assessment system and hence the shift towards a combination of innovative assessment systems is inevitable.
Essay 216:
A planned city can be a blessing for the residences while an unplanned one can be quite the opposite and that is why planning is a crucial part while establishing a new city. Though traditional cities distinguish the residential area and include plans to build commercial and public service buildings altogether, away from the main area, many modern designers prefer these commercial establishments to be located at different places and I am quite convinced that the latter one would bring more benefits to the city dwellers.
To begin with, though traditional cities are initially planned to have commercial buildings located in the centre of the city, to be away from the main residential area, in a few years, the structure of the city changes and it becomes a more unplanned city than ever. It is natural that parents would prefer to send their children to a nearby school while shoppers would love to shop from around the corner. As a consequence, residential areas at a time become semi-commercial areas and traffic congestion kills people’s valuable time. In such cities, pollution increases and a few percentages of landlords get higher commercial rents while others do not.
On the contrary, if cities have saturated commercial settings, it will assure balanced residential and commercial establishments and city dwellers would be greatly benefitted from it. The house rent would be fair and the traffic condition on the roads would be far better. Furthermore, the authority would have control over the future expansion of the area and face fewer difficulties to ensure the necessary facilities for the local people.
To conclude, the modern city planning that supports the location of commercial entities and public services to be built in various areas of the city rather than having those altogether offers numerous advantages to the local authorities including better traffic condition, more reliable public facilities, fair rent and future expansion of the city.
Essay 218:
We started living in a cave, as history suggests, and thanks to the novelty and advancement of modern technology that we now live in a grand apartment with many facilities which were unimaginable even a century ago. From an uncertain life where our ancestors had to deal with constant fears of darkness and lurking predators, we have a remarkably comfortable and advanced lifestyle and this has all been possible due to technological advancements.
It is often argued by many that modern technology has given us comfort but has cost us dearly. As an example, they point out that we have become less active and more dependent on machines, especially on household appliances. According to them, this is a backward step and apparatuses cannot improve our lifestyle. What they fail to realise is that the blessing of science has eradicated many deadly diseases that had often wiped out cities and made us vulnerable like ants in the water. Advancement in technology is not a one-dimensional straight line, it is a spark of light, and without it, we would still be at the mercy of natural calamities. People may blame science for the contamination of food or the advent of fast food, but it is worth mentioning that without science, we would have a world war for the food crisis.
The household appliances like washing machines and vacuum cleaners have reduced the manual labour of cleaning while rice cookers, microwave ovens, coffee makers and electric kettles have improved the way we cook at home. We no longer need to end our day when the sun sets as electric bulbs illuminate the world. Thus, it is easy to criticise the innovation and wonder science has brought to our life but living without them is utterly impossible. For instance, imagine what the world would be without electricity, refrigerators, TVs and the internet - unimaginable even for a day.
To conclude, it is undeniable that modern household appliances have made our tasks easier, faster and more accurate. With this, we have a better lifestyle and more time to spend with our family members or to enjoy our leisure activities.
Essay 219:
Innovations of science have touched the lives of billions as most homes, these days, have at least a washing machine, refrigerator, microwave oven, and air conditioner, and these tools have profoundly enhanced the way people live their life. Yet, the negative effects of this dependency cannot be denied.
To begin with, these household appliances save a great deal of time and human labour and this is simply amazing. People no longer need to work all day long to finish their works, and as a result, people can have more quality times. This is definitely a great leap towards modernisation and a significant enhancement of their lifestyle. For instance, most women in the past century had to remain busy at home but these days they can spend more leisure time and this has all been possible due to the advents of modern household appliances.
However, modern technology cannot ensure a better lifestyle by all means and in many cases, it deteriorates our lifestyle. For instance, TV is considered to be a wonder box in most houses. Due to our addiction to TV, we have little time to talk with other family members. This is not the desired state at all but an example of how machines can negatively affect our lifestyle. Moreover, the modern technology used for preparing food and drinks are not always safe and cannot be compared with the hygiene and food value we used to get from food when they were collected from natural sources and made manually. For instance, the burger, sandwich or ice cream made at home are not as nutritious as our grandmother’s cookies or cakes were.
We can, therefore, conclude that technology is a blessing for us and at the same time if we do not use it sensibly, it might bring a curse for us as well. This is why, we will have to determine the limit of its usages, even at home, to make our lifestyle standard as well as safe.
Essay 220:
The recent political unrest, war and the rise of a few terrorist groups have made many people become refugees and this is a global problem. As an immediate solution, many express their view that rich countries should allow more evacuees to enter their border to reduce the severity of this crisis. However, accepting a higher number of migrants by the developed countries is not a viable solution to this refugee crisis, in my opinion.
To begin with, worldwide refugees and their constant sufferings are often reported on TV. It might seem that industrialised countries can easily solve this emergency and miseries by allowing more refugees to enter their countries. In reality, this is certainly not an easy solution. If we only look at the few recent catastrophic events that the migrant refugees have caused, it would become clear why the governments in developed countries are unwavering to accept more people to their countries. Besides, historically, it is evident that only granting more refugees in other countries does not solve the problem, in some cases, it deteriorates it.
It is true that, due to humanitarian reasons, some developed countries should help destitute and needy people. This is partly a moral issue and partly because it is in the self-economic interest of the industrialised countries. Considering this, a practical way of reducing the severity of this crisis would be to accept more refugees, particularly when it is caused by a natural disaster and civil war.
But, from a more practical point of view, mass immigrations would bring more negative effects. Solving the root cause of the outbreaks of refugees is a far better way than allowing them freely migrate to developed countries. On a practical level, homeless refugees are sometimes better off receiving aid in their homeland than suffering racism and begging on the streets in a country where they cannot speak the language.
To conclude, rich countries should take refugees but only in extreme cases and should focus on solving the primary reason behind the refugee issue. Sometimes funds and aids for refugees in their local area are far more beneficial than accepting them as migrants and finally forcing them to beg on the street.
Essay 222:
Cities offer excellent education facilities, job opportunities and a better standard of living. This is why the influx of people in cities is ever-increasing and young people mostly move to cities, away from their families, to pursue a better education and to have a job. Though there are many advantages to this trend, negative sides are also there.
To commence with, the young generation has to move to cities to get admitted into better colleges or universities. Evidently, cities have more specialised universities while rural areas scarcely have such facilities. This is why parents want their children to study in a college in a city rather than in a village. Moreover, jobs, business opportunities, living standard, health care and technological advancements often bound educated young to move to urban areas. For instance, an IT professional has almost no chances of having a job in a remote area while there are plenty of opportunities for this person in a city.  
I believe that there are more advantages to this trend, though the negative consequences should also be considered. First of all, only a handful of youth would be able to start a career in villages and most of them would eventually be forced to move. This is because the opportunity and facilities in cities are much wider. Unless the government creates new job opportunities for the educated young generation in rural areas, forcing them to stay there would be a terrible idea. On the contrary, if everyone moves to the cities, the rural areas will always remain underdeveloped and would lack talented entrepreneurs. This would also increase the population density and pollutions in metro areas.
In conclusion, some professionals, like doctors should be encouraged to work in rural areas while professionals like software developers should stay in the city. However, the government should take initiatives to build new offices and factories in rural areas so that young people can work and stay there.
Essay 224:
Some youngsters consider a gap year the key to enhancing their career prospects, while others think it is a worthless pursuit. I believe that pursuing a gap year can provide worthwhile experiences to juveniles, laying the seeds of a prosperous professional career.
On the one hand, by taking a gap year, youngsters can gain relevant work experiences and key skills which help broaden their view of the world. Working during the defer years can increase their knowledge and communication skills. Furthermore, experiencing the customs and cultures of other countries help gain appreciation and awareness of global issues, which put them in leadership positions. Such knowledge is paramount to secure a dream job in the future.
However, if the gap year is used imprudently, it can cost an awful amount of money and time. To add to the ordeal, one can get into debt. One in ten people faces financial ordeals from budget mismanagement according to gap-year tour operators. In my view, that number is negligible.
Finally, in my opinion, hefty expenses should be the least cause for deterring a gap year. The return on investment is high, bringing positive drastic changes to the personality of the youngster. Travelling to other countries solidifies young adults with soft, and hard skills; moulding character and individuality. Facing and circumventing adversity in an unfamiliar country sets a solid foundation for solving problems in life. Such an experience is worth the expense.
In conclusion, there is definitely an edge some young person can attain contrasting to those who consider gap-years an expensive waste of time. However, improper planning can adversely affect personal finances, but accurate gap-year budget and plans eliminate the risk of debt and waste of time.
Essay 226:
The internet has profound contributions to our lifestyle and daily needs. Also, information is instantaneously available, at the behest of the people due to this technology. From a historical perspective, the comfort level enjoyed by people is at its pinnacle. Such is the impact of the internet on our life. This essay will discuss how the internet is playing an indispensable role in shaping education as one of the main advantages, and, secondly, outline how cybercrimes can adversely affect lives.
The internet significantly boosts student autonomy. Students have the freedom to focus on whatever topics or subjects they want to study and learn more on this subject. An example is the number of online courses available, covering a variety of subjects, which up until today was unavailable to most learners. This has caused an upsurge in the number of people studying tertiary-level degrees, at a pace and schedule that suits them the best. Education is no more a rigid process of learning in classrooms, rather, it is an entertaining, engaging and fun activity and thanks to the internet technology for that.
The main disadvantage associated with the usage of the internet is the rise of electronic crimes. People risk their privacy online by having their sensitive information stolen by malicious software written by nefarious hackers. According to Time Magazine, the shopping giant Walmart suffered one of the largest online heists ever, where a security breach leaked millions of credit card information. This resulted in disrupting their shopping services; affecting customers living in remote areas.
In conclusion, the benefits the internet bring to education, such as student autonomy, must be measured against the drawbacks, such as cybercrimes. Overall, the internet’s positive usage by people all over the world significantly outweighs its negative usage.
Essay 228:
Recently, in many countries, there has been a steady decline in the number of people willing to become teachers, especially in secondary schools. This essay will look at the reasons for this downfall and propose some solutions.
One of the main problems contributing to the lack of interest in pursuing a career in teaching is lower remuneration. In other words, salaries earned by teachers are lower compared to other professions. For example, a school teacher in Bangladesh earns a salary of 10,000 takas compared to other professions where the salary is at least 25,000 taka. Raising the minimum wage of teachers will significantly encourage people to take up teaching as a profession.
Another cause that magnifies the problem is the difficult behaviours exhibited by secondary level students. That is to say, adolescents, these days behave indecently by showing brash attitudes towards teachers. Such misbehaviour and misdemeanours do little to motivate a teacher to pursue the profession in a high school. According to Psychology Today, 60 per cent of the teachers feel indignant and dejected while teaching high school students. Which causes current teachers to quit and un-appeals prospective teachers. Rectifying students behaviours will encourage more employees to pursue the teaching profession.
The final cause is the amount is workload; both on and off school hours. To elaborate, teachers often have to sacrifice their personal time to check student copies, exam papers at home. Doing so does not allow a teacher to rest and recover from stress, which is hazardous to both the psychological and physical well-being of the teacher. This eventually causes the burnout effect, where the mind and body cease to function properly. An ideal solution to kerb such an effect is to improvise work-life balance by the respective school authorities. This will attract more people to this profession.
In summary, lower remuneration disinterests teachers towards the profession which can be solved by increasing wages. Difficult behaviours by high school students demotivate the teacher causing them to quit or disinterest potential teachers, which can be solved by rectifying student behaviours. Overwork detriments the mental and physical well-being of teachers causing the burnout effect, which can be solved by improvising work-life balance by school authorities.
In conclusion, we need excellent teachers to build a better nation as their contribution as teachers are unparalleled. So we need to solve problems that deter talented and motivated individuals to become teachers.
Essay 229:
These days fewer people are drawn to becoming high school teachers in many parts of the world. Many reasons contribute to this trend and low wages for teachers and teenage disciplinary problems are most significant among them. However, some solutions can be implemented to encourage talented youth to pursue the teaching profession including better remuneration and reasonable workloads, for example.
The interest in becoming secondary level school teachers is declining and young people are taking more interests in becoming engineers, pilots, IT professionals and doctors. Studies show that teachers are not well paid and their salaries are far less than other professionals like bankers or pilots. Moreover, in many countries, being a high school teacher is not a prestigious career and this social dogma deter talented individuals to become teachers. In addition, according to disciplinary studies, high school going pupils' behaviours is another reason many teachers do not feel like being in the right profession. Parental focus on their children has reduced and consequently, it has created a whole new generation who misbehave in schools.
Some initiatives may encourage the future generation to go into the teaching profession. First, increasing the salaries and benefits for the teachers would be a great step. It would encourage young students to ponder about becoming a teacher. Furthermore, to reduce the teachers' workloads, schools should employ assistants to help the tutors. Lastly, school authority should get involved in maintaining a better teaching environment and implement corporal punishment for misbehaving pupils.
To conclude, the passion to become teachers, especially at the secondary level, is declining. Nevertheless, proper solutions are there to address these problems to encourage more talented individuals to come into the teaching profession and help build the nation.
Essay 231:
The provision of education by the state is a norm in many developed nations, and its significance cannot be stressed enough. Many private setups are expanding their foothold of taking over the task these days. As many are of the view that it is the sole responsibility of the government to impart educational services, I strongly agree with them and opine that private education should be banned.
Opponents of this belief put forth that negating the private sector from setting up schools, colleges and universities would deprive many of getting the necessary education and this is a violation of their rights. It is the parental judgement that can best serve as a guide as to which teaching system tailors for their child's needs and abilities. It is also the case that every year majority of school dropouts and sick leaves are attributed to unclean drinking water and squalid conditions in state-funded educational spots, making privately organised educational institutes safer to acquire knowledge.
Supporters of private education do not bear in mind that not everyone can afford the sky-high fee offered by private organisations. Additionally, the huge amount of taxes we pay annually obviates the need for the government to contribute to investing in the realm of education. When a government ensures education for all, the syllabus used in schools would be the same all over the country and that would ensure a better education system for all.
Hence it is imperative that putting a lid on the private educational counterpart fuels the survival of the individual and the society, thereby further advocating my stance of government funding the system of education.
Essay 232:
Usages of the internet and smartphones have become a global phenomenon, and we depend on these technological marvels one way or another. While some people assert that the widespread use of internet communication and mobile phones will replace the traditional form of face to face interaction, I completely disagree with this view.
To begin with, the use of the internet and other latest communication technologies drive us to meet new people and contact the dear ones who stay far away. This can especially be true when one gets a chance to express his or her feelings via a text or phone call. To quote an example, Skype and Facebook have enabled people living in far-flung areas to communicate effectively through video chats, thereby enabling us to contact more frequently with people we care about. This has not replaced the way we care and meet others, rather it has made it more convenient and frequent.
While the advancement of technology might scale back in personal contact to some extent for the short term, it, in fact, enables people to become more polarised towards seeing siblings, parents and mates in the long run. This can be easily visualised by taking into account that if we are to sustain the internet as a tool to deliver our emotions and beliefs to the world, we will need to picture proof gatherings, celebrations and events thereby obviating the need for face to face communication.
Secondly, the human is a social being, and it is to the credit of this physical presence that we as a species are able to harness long-term relationships, so its value cannot be undermined. Mere endorsing words of good character by texts cannot inculcate the right kind of virtue, thereby further laying emphasis on human presence for the future is required.
Essay 233:
Due to the increasing pollution and higher population density, healthy living and the government's role in it is a great concern for many. Some opine that the government needs to pass laws regarding food intake to improve public health, while others oppose this idea as they believe that it is a matter of individual choice. The following paragraphs will shed some light on this debate before drawing a logical conclusion.
To begin with, a healthy lifestyle is a choice and habit of an individual. No matter how many laws are passed and how strictly the government monitors the food quality, if a person does not follow a healthy lifestyle and eating habit, he will surely suffer from health-related issues. Thus the choices of individuals greatly affect the overall health condition of a nation. To lead a healthy life, citizens not always need expensive food, gym facilities, expert dieticians and so on. For instance, the rich population of a country suffers from obesity, diabetics and many other diseases that are less prevalent among middle-class people.
On the other hand, the use of chemicals, preservatives and adhesives in food items should be banned, and only the government can ensure that. Even after having a proper diet and regular exercise, if people are forced to eat foods that have chemicals and harmful ingredients, they would suffer from dangerous diseases. Using unauthorised chemicals, selling expired and low-quality foods should be halted by the authority. Infrequent market monitoring and the lack of quality control for food items are two reasons our market is full of unhygienic food items. The government's initiative can reduce this depravity and crime to a great extent.
To conclude, the citizens of a country have to follow a healthy lifestyle, while the government must ensure hygiene in food production and food sales. Their combined initiatives and efforts can greatly promote public health.
Essay 235:
Employees, these days, usually have to extend their working hours beyond the conventional 9 to 5 schedule. This, in turn, creates negative effects on the employees, both psychologically and physically. Let me examine the reasons for this stress at the workplace, and provide some measures that employers could take in order to break the cycle for a more balanced life.
One of the major reasons, which make working-class people fall into a stressful life, is the heavy workload. Constant deadlines and work pressure make employees' life miserable. Moreover, they need to secure their job by showing better performance and proving their worth and need incentives to support the soaring price of everything. To illustrate, many organizations set monthly targets for their employees so that workers work extra hours to achieve their goals while many employees spontaneously work extra hours to earn the bonus.
Employers can take various measures to ease the situation and help employees become not only happy but also loyal to the company and more productive in the long run. First and foremost, they can hire more employees, as the work burden can be shared among them. They can also offer incentives to employees who work dedicatedly, not just long hours. Besides, they can make the office environment more favourable for employees. For instance, some large tech giants render many recreational activities, such as meditation and gym at the workplaces which make their employees happier people at work.
In conclusion, happy employees and lenient employers would increase the productivity of an organisation to a greater extent. That is why it is expected that employers would look after their workers' happiness while employees would work dedicatedly.
Essay 237:
For more desirable job opportunities or better education, many young people these days leave their house and live away from their families. This trend has both pros and cons which will be elucidated in this essay. I personally feel that leaving home for better education or career is the right step to take.
On the one hand, if young people live separately, they learn how to become self-reliant and make decisions independently. For example, when those young people live with their family, most of their tasks are done by their parents. However, when they start living far away, they learn how to manage their time, clean the house, do laundry, cook, pay the bills and so on. Also, they learn the value of money and try to spend it reasonability and save it for the future. Furthermore, they make new friends and learn about diverse customs and cultures.
On the other hand, when those young people live alone, they need to take many responsibilities. Initially, this leads them to feel isolated, and they often feel depressed as a result. Furthermore, they are not always mature enough to avoid the pitfalls of bad company and habits. So, if they find inappropriate friends or roommates who have bad habits, they would probably get involved in unethical acts and crimes.
Considering both the advantages and disadvantages, it seems reasonable to outline that sooner or later they will have to take up those responsibilities and it is better that they face life and its challenges at a young age.
In conclusion, from what has been discussed, although living alone may have some drawbacks, it leads to young people bringing up more independence which is essential for their career growth and life.
Essay 239:
Big corporations and international brands spend a large sum of money on marketing and advertising. Consequently, people tend to buy their products while small local businesses fail to reach potential customers. This can lead to some serious problems; such as the closure of local businesses, unemployment and the monopoly in the market. There are a few steps that can be adopted to address this issue and motivate people to buy local products.
Naturally, consumers prefer to buy products that were consciously and unconsciously promulgated to their minds by large brands. Due to this, many local businesses, even with their quality products, cannot attract customers. The dominance of international brands thus ruins local business entities. As a consequence, many small local companies run out of business, and it can make thousands of people unemployed. Moreover, creative and deceptive advertisements and marketing policies of big players create a monopoly in the market which traps many consumers in believing that bigger brands mean prestige and quality. For instance, the dominance of international clothing and fashion brands had swept away many local businesses in many Asian countries, including mine, and money spent on advertisement played a big role here.
To encourage people to purchase local products, some measures should be taken into account. The government should strictly monitor and ban any deceptive and illusory advertisements from the mass media. Besides, people should compare product quality before purchasing from shops, and the shop owners should be encouraged to shelf local products along with the branded products. Furthermore, authorities should rate and review any product and disclose it to the public. Finally, local product manufacturers should be financially supported by the banks and the government as they are helpful for the economic progress of a country.  
To conclude, the absolute dominance of large businesses can have many negative effects that can damage the market and economy of a country. A solution to this problem is systematising local markets and creating a closely integrated system that can have an effective outcome.
Essay 241:
Some people believe that technology adversely influences our lives and its manipulating aspects take control of our lifestyle. Others, however, hold the view that technology has many benefits to offer to humankind. This essay discusses both views. However, I think that technology will be advantageous as long as we control it, and do not let it control us.
To begin with, technology has dramatically shaped the way people live, and it is constantly making our life easier. Quite often, tech developers announce innovative tech gadgets that are easy to use, handy, innovative, and life-saving. These devices improve people's lives significantly and we have a better lifestyle today than in the past due to the improvements and innovations in technology. For instance, mobile phones have been improved noticeably in terms of performance and usefulness. Nowadays, they are being used in every aspect of life including paying bills, making contacts, taking notes, surfing the internet and for many other practical purposes. The modern world is indeed defined by modern technologies.
On the other hand, technology does not come without negative consequences. It has already started controlling many of our daily life aspects and can get more catastrophic than anyone could even imagine if it gets out of control. For example, everybody is using cellular devices these days, so they store their personal photos, contact details and even files on their phones. Thus, it is pretty easy for hackers to hack into someone's phone and misuse them. Online transaction fraud, malicious viruses and trojans, health hazards, lack of personal and social bonding are thus attributed to our inclination towards technology. We are meant to control the technology, not being controlled by it.
In conclusion, even though technology has its disadvantages, it is undeniable that not everything that the human creates is flawless. Furthermore, technology can be very handy if it is used properly and with precaution. So, we should be in control of technology, not let it control us.
Essay 243:
Many people believe that tertiary education should be focused on the future professions of students. Others, however, oppose this idea and opine that a university is a place to shape the overall ability of learners to create an enlightened nation. I agree with the latter view and believe that the way universities teach around the world is a far better setup than focusing only on job-centric education.
First of all, in the modern world, the job sectors are dynamic and employees take on new challenges and work in diverse areas at their workplaces. Knowledge learned from the university subjects, only focused on careers, fails to enhance the overall skill of students. So, it can be catastrophic for a nation to have a workforce who have been taught job-related courses but were not introduced to the vast array of other aspects of education. Most of the companies, these days, search for people who are more dynamic and have diverse skills than candidates with good grades. For instance, most software development companies give priority to a candidate's performance, skill set and analytical ability than his academic results.
Secondly, the competitive job sector all over the world forces many graduates to seek jobs in an entirely different sector than their majors in universities. Thus someone who graduated from IT is becoming a banker and someone from a finance background is working as an HR. Many also set up their own business instead of doing a job. It has all been possible due to a wide range of subjects that the universities have taught to those students.
Furthermore, employees often need to enrol in different training and professional courses. Those who have finished a university degree with a wide range of subjects would do better in those training programmes and courses. For instance, IT professionals often take the MBA course and this is another good example of why university students should study an extensive range of subjects rather than studying some particular subjects for the jobs.
I, therefore, conclude that a wide range of subjects at the university level is more useful for a student's career and overall growth. Hence, job-centric university education sounds like a good idea in theory, but in practice, this is a faulty one.
Essay 244:
Arts reflect the heritage of a country and depict the creativity of an individual. While many believe that financing in arts is a wastage of money, I am of the opposite view as I believe that financing in arts is a good idea for the government.
Many people think that diverting funds towards arts hamper the well-being of citizens and the development of the nation. For example, available monetary resources, according to them, could be put to use in building more hospitals, roads, schools and developing other infrastructures. This means increasing care of the sick and improved transportation to previously inaccessible areas. For children, it caters for better education facilities. These people believe that art is a luxury and many governments cannot afford this extravagance.
However, while investments in such areas are vital, spending on arts is equally important. Allocating money to the development and sustenance of arts helps boost the economy, and arts are important to alleviate crime from society and positively entertain and engage people. Art galleries can attract tourists from all over the world, generating revenue in return while artists can reveal discrimination of society through their works. It is also the case that viewing and practising arts, such as painting, music, acting, dancing and so on, are good sources of venting out stress while educating people at the same time. Such activities also portray a positive picture of a nation to the world. If governments fail to support arts fiscally, many art galleries and theatres would not be able to survive. Arts is as important as science for the true progress of a nation.
Some people contend that there are many pressing concerns that a country must resolve before putting emphasis on the arts. However, I personally think that arts are an essential part of a culture, and it is quite fair to allocate funds to preserve and develop arts.
Admittedly, there are some justifications by people who oppose spending on promoting arts. First of all, most art projects are expensive with no obvious outcomes that have direct relations to a nation’s income. For example, the monument of Kebangkitan Pahlawan in Malang city that adsorbed almost 1 billion rupiahs does not attract people that much. Besides, art is not a critical aspect of the sustainability of human’s life. Human’s life will not disappear just because they have less taste of aesthetics.
However, I still support that the government should allocate a budget for the arts. Arts are part of a culture and over time become the identity of a nation, eventually, arts could be a major source of income for them. For instance, Bali is an island in Indonesia, where millions of visitors come each year to experience the combination of conventional values and modern lifestyles. The government in Indonesia invests more than a third of its budget to maintain its traditional arts.
Furthermore, art makes a life worth living. Like food, art is a supplement for the human soul. It has a magnificent power to aid buildings, roads, parks, and everything, with its uniqueness. Just imagine how empty a room would be if there is no painting or decoration on the wall! Art is enhancing people’s life by leveraging their experiences and empowering people to possess beautiful imaginations.
Essay 245:
The proliferation of supermarkets in rural and urban areas is on the rise, and it is thought to be beneficial by some and damaging to the local businesses by others. While people with both points of view continue to exist, I strongly believe that opening up shopping marts helps local communities to bloom and blossom.
Proponents of the idea argue that international products render local investors out of business. As increasing numbers of cheap goods are available to choose from, sufficient funds may not be available to local people to produce items of comparable quality and sell them at a cheap price. For example, ever since the advent of Chinese cotton and food industries, the native Pakistani cotton fabric industry has almost shut down. This has also resulted in many individuals being unemployed, also leaving local contractors paralysed.
However, while such problems do occur, large shopping areas, in fact, help to sustain local produce. Firstly, as competitors stock their articles from around the world, inhabitants of the area stand a better chance to sell their crops and finished goods to a greater number of customers. Generation of an increased amount of revenue would be a direct consequence, therefore, enhancing the gross domestic product in return. Moreover, the establishment of supermarkets can help foster pride en masse. This can be especially true in cases where local items occupy shelves of supermarkets, enabling purchases by international customers. Provided marketing strategies are put to use, a brand might become popular all over the world, thereby setting the stage for uplifting morale.
To conclude, it is imperative that the growth and sustenance of supermarkets will fuel the survival of local communities and it is expected that more initiatives would be taken to expand supermarkets where local products are displayed and sold.
Essay 247:
A group of people believe that paying taxes is the biggest contribution by citizens and those taxpayers are already making enough contribution to be exempted from other duties to society. However, others opine that paying taxes does not automatically spare citizens from other obligations and moral duties. This essay discusses both views, however, I believe that all citizens have to abide by their social responsibilities while capable members must pay taxes.
On the one hand, tax money helps the authority run the public service, pay salaries to government employees, take new development initiatives, fund research works, and offer subsidiaries to important sectors. So this money essentially helps run the country. Without the taxpayers' money, for example, the price of commodities will go up, no new roads would be built, education and medical treatment would be expensive. So it is understandable that a taxpayer is contributing to smoothly run the country and should be offered some benefits than non-taxpayers, and if required, they should be excused from other social responsibilities.
On the other hand, it is undeniable that taxpayers are also benefiting from the money they are paying and should not be released from their other duties. Just paying tax should not allow someone to be above the law. These taxpayers should follow rules and also act virtuously to keep society on track. Besides, they have moral duties to people around them due to their financial well-off status. For instance, the highest taxpayers in society are usually the most powerful and financially successful persons, and due to their social influences, they have even more responsibilities to help needy people and take initiatives to save the environment and make the area a better place to live in.
In conclusion, paying tax is important, but it does not automatically excuse them from obeying social rules, helping needy people and performing moral duties. It is expected that taxpayers would take more responsibilities in society to make it even better.
Essay 248:
Some people think that making proper contributions to society can be achieved just by paying taxes, while others argue that other than paying taxes, people should fulfil more duties. This essay will elaborate on both of the views in detail.
To begin with, paying taxes is certainly a big contribution to society as it gives financial resources to the authority for the development of a country. Since the public budget from the taxes is used in all crucial aspects of a nation, paying taxes undoubtedly is vital for each capable member of society. Tax money is used to develop infrastructures, like roads, hospitals, schools, and public facilities. It is also used to pay the salaries of civil servants who work for the government and society. Moreover, it can be used to give subsidies on education, medical treatment, fuel price and so on, which help ordinary and needy citizens to a great extent.
Yet, to fulfil someone's responsibilities to society, people are required to abide by the rules and laws and make other contributions to make some positive changes in society. Indonesia, for example, as one of the biggest countries consisting of 34 provinces and more than 200 million people, needs such contributions from all of its members. Such countries direly need the involvement of citizens in supporting government-initiated programmes, especially by mutual cooperation as a form of contribution. By doing so, people can directly and immediately work together to protect their environment by initiatives like planting trees and cleaning up their surroundings, as well as protecting the public facilities. Being a law-abiding citizen means much than paying taxes.
Essay 249:
Different kinds of sports are enjoyed by sports lovers around the world, and nowadays, it has become one of the common leisure activities, and so, some people argue that it is a waste of time and they advise opting for outdoor activities instead. In my opinion, watching sports on television is not a waste of time, but, there should be a balance between the time spent on watching sports and taking part in other social and recreational activities.
First of all, watching sports is an excellent form of entertainment, relaxation, and for many, this is even a passion to follow. Moreover, People watch sports with others, which is a great way of socialising and enhancing the relationship. In my country, for example, watching live sports on TV has become an event of socialising and communicating with each other. However, spending hours after hours in front of a TV set to watch different sports and not doing anything is not recommended.
On the contrary, many people claim that watching sporting events in free time every day is not a good habit or a healthy activity as this time could be better utilised by taking part in other social activities and skill development programmes. People, who watch TV most of the time, become isolated and develop unhealthy eating habit. Thus according to many, watching sports on TV has no significant benefits. They affirm that participating in outdoor activities are much healthier and advantageous.
To conclude, we have to maintain a balance in our leisure activities; while enjoying sports is a good way of relaxation and socialisation, too much of it can be harmful. We have to choose plenty of various free-time activities, especially outdoor activities, to maintain a healthy lifestyle.
Essay 251:
Influences of parents and family have great importance to the development of a child, according to many, while others opine that children's behaviour is influenced more by outside factors like friends, teachers and the environment. This essay will discuss both views, but, in my opinion, influences of parents, and family life are essential for the proper growth of a child, but environmental and external influences are more useful for them to confront life ad become successful.
To commence with, parents have extraordinary impacts on their children's growth, especially to shape a good childhood. The sense of family, relationship, responsibility, and punctuality are instilled in a child by parents and it plays an influential role in their maturity. Love and attention from parents develop a strong character in a child while the lack of proper parenting often ruins it, according to many psychologists. Furthermore, children mostly mimic their parents and become more like them. Undoubtedly, this single fact proves how important it is for a child to have a family and good parenting.
Conversely, to become successful and face life, we need to study in a school, interact with teachers and neighbours, have friends, face challenges, learn from our environment, gain social experiences, and all those factors have crucial roles to play in a child’s life. Parents keep their offspring safe from dangers while their real-life experiences teach them how to deal with those obstacles. Outside the home, children encounter different situations that teach them how to solve their own problems. Furthermore, children learn invaluable skills in schools which help them develop a sense of community to have a normal life beyond their family borders.
To conclude, while parents have a huge impact on children’s attitude and growth, social interactions and external factors are imperative and cannot be ignored for a child's overall development, and in my opinion, more important.
Essay 253:
Whether men and women have equal capacity to do any job or the type of work they do should be based on their natural features and inherent abilities is a widely debated issue. While some believe that both genders have an equal aptitude to do any sort of work, others, however, deny it. This essay delves into the issue and then draw a sensible conclusion.
A group of people opine that men and women are not physically much different. Apart from that, men and women possess the same natural abilities, thinking patterns, emotions, needs and instincts. Since women are kept mostly inside houses, they react differently than men in different situations. If both men and women are given equal opportunity and experience, they can both handle any job with the same efficiency. Thus, this group of people deny that any particular gender is better prepared for a job than the opposite gender. For example, they say that in the past, women were deprived of education, job and other social activities, and because of that, the number of women in higher corporate positions was fewer than that of today's number.
Another group, however, remains strict to the fact that men and women have different physical and mental capacities and these capacities make them more suitable for different types of professions. For instance, a woman is a natural caregiver and hence nursing is a more suitable profession for her. On the contrary construction works, one example of such many professions is suitable for men.  
In conclusion, tasks for men and women are determined mostly by their natural abilities and this is a natural law. Denying it would not be a good idea and in my opinion, no task is less important and thus distinctive professions makes them perform better.
Essay 254:
Whether natural aptitude should determine the kind of work both men and women should do or they are capable of doing the same type of work is somewhat controversial and require thorough discussion. This essay will explain both aspects. However, I believe that both genders are qualified to take the same challenge and are capable of doing similar jobs.
From one perspective, women are generally considered physically weaker than men and hence less suitable for jobs that require ferocity and physical power. Men, on the other hand, are meant to provide and protect their wives and the entire family and earn the living. Secondly, the caring nature and tender heart that women possess make them more capable of certain careers. This means they generally perform better in occupations that require patience, caring and kind heart such as nursing, social works and teaching.
From the opposite perspective, modern society does not discriminate against genders and offer any type of work to both male and female due to its fairness and advancements. Women and men who go to the same university and take the same training programmes are equally prepared to take a job. Again, the traditional idea that women will take care of their children while men will earn the living is changing and a reverse scenario could be seen in many families. Finally, women, in almost all fields, have already proved that they can perform as good as men if they are given the opportunity. So there is no way we can undermine their capability.
In conclusion, although being naturally endowed may be beneficial for both genders in some situations, it is not particularly needed at workplaces. Learning and training are indispensable for men and women in any society to work for the same jobs.
Essay 256:
In today's world, various media have become quite significant in our life. I believe media like television, radio, book, film, theatre and comics have different advantages and disadvantages of their own as they have subtle differences in the way they convey messages and communicate information. The discussion about the positive and negative aspects of three media- TV, radio and books, will be outlined in the following paragraphs, and in my opinion, books are the most effective media for communicating information.
First of all, as a modern medium, television has become a part of human life. Information presented on TV is easy to absorb and they are both informative and entertaining. However, it can make people passive, as the viewers just sit and watch it. Besides, research shows that TV programmes are addictive and can be a huge waste of time for many.
Secondly, radio has an important value in our lives when it comes to conveying important information. This tool is helpful for visually impaired people, and we can work and enjoy radio programmes simultaneously, unlike TV programmes. We can carry it with us everywhere we go as modern radios are pretty small and are integrated with devices like smartphones. In contrast, radio signals are sometimes weak and limited only in a specific area. Over time, this medium is losing its popularity due to its technological limitations.
Finally, books share invaluable information and contain important facts and stories. Data collected from the past are stored in books and help research works. By reading books people can broaden their imagination, enhance their knowledge and learn new things. Books are so far the best medium for communicating information - from generation to generation and past to present, and are the base of our modern civilisation. I believe the book is the most effective medium so far and will remain so for many coming generations. Except for the time and patience it requires, it hardly has any disadvantages.
In conclusion, every medium for communicating information has some distinct advantages and demerits, but books are the most effective media that can enlighten our minds and convey knowledge from one generation to another.
Essay 257:
These days, various types of media, such as books, film, theatre and so on are used for communicating useful information. This essay discusses the positive and negative aspects of television, radio and comics as media. In my opinion, radio is the most effective medium to communicate useful information.
To commence with, many people like television because they can both listen to the information and visually see the events. News programmes inform people about national and international events and documentaries are a great source of learning materials. Should there be a special event in the country, most people would turn their TVs on and that makes it an effective tool to deliver different messages to the people. However, television has its own weakness as it is not mobile and thus often fail to reach people who are not home.
Some people like the radio because of its mobility and entertainment programmes. Although many people consider it as old fashioned, others still prefer listening to the radio for obtaining useful information. People listen to the news, weather updates, traffic updates, music, discussions and so on while they drive, and it makes radio quite useful. However, it is not useful to people who have some sort of hearing impairment.
Although several people think that comics are mostly for children, many adults still like reading comics. As comic conveys messages in the form of stories and dialogues, it is an effective tool for delivering important messages to young people. Despite the positive side, comic books have some drawbacks. The cost of producing comics is high and not all adults like to read them.
To conclude, even though these media have both advantages and limitations, they are useful to people. The radio is the most beneficial tool to inform people and convey important messages because of its mobility. It is expected that these media would be used more effectively to help people learn and communicate important information with them.
Essay 259:
The Internet is a revolutionary technology and it has changed the way people work, interact with each other and interchange information. But the negative consequences of it can not be overlooked and these problems stem mostly from the overuse and over-reliance on this technology. In this essay, the main problems of Internet technology with possible solutions will be discussed.
To commence with the problems, widespread use of the Internet is related to new and innovative devices like smartphones and computers, and we replace those devices more frequently than ever. Thus we are creating a throwaway society and contributing to the production of more hazardous waste every day. Furthermore, social media, online games, chat rooms are contributing to digital addictions among many teenagers. Apathy, for instance, is one of the most severe consequences of overreliance on the Internet and that obstructs people from participating in social activities. Besides, people are becoming less active, both socially and physically, due to increased screen time. As a result, our health condition is deteriorating and our social life is in jeopardy. Finally, our privacy is hanging on an edge and our security is at risk due to our extensive dependency on the Internet.
After investigating the causes of the problems, it will be easier to offer solutions. First, parents should encourage their children to take part in outdoor activities, and restrict their screen time. Second, we should buy new electronic devices only when this is absolutely necessary. Moreover, the use of the Internet in schools and workplaces should be monitored. The young generation should be encouraged to get involved in social activities and take charity works. Finally, we should make our Internet access more secure and follow the standard security protocol so that hackers and intruders cannot access and gain our personal information like passwords or credit card information.
In conclusion, even though our society is becoming more dependent on the Internet and that can bring severe negative results, we have the solutions to mitigate these problems and enjoy the good side this technology offers us.
Essay 260:
Many people believe that the Internet is the reason for many severe problems in society despite its numerous benefits. This essay will discuss some major problems of Internet usages and some of the solutions to resolve them.
For several reasons, the worldwide use of the Internet is the root cause of several serious issues. Firstly, it provides access to many inappropriate contents to its users, including children. As a result, many teenagers are addicted to obscenity and violence which has impacted their psychological growth and academic performance. Secondly, it has diminished real-life communication between families, friends and relatives. With the existence of smartphones and tablets, social networking platforms and an active internet connection, people stay online for several hours a day. Consequently, they are less interested in having face-to-face conversations with others.
To resolve the first issue, parents should monitor children's online activities. They should check their children's devices and advise them about the serious effects of accessing unsuitable content. Parents could also make a security setting for their home internet setting, whereas inappropriate websites will be blocked. As for the second issue, it requires the commitment of individuals and family members. For example, as parents need to lead by example, they should set examples by using gadgets for a certain period of time each day. Family members should be disallowed to bring their devices during mealtime, therefore there will be plenty of time for verbal interactions between them.
In conclusion, the Internet has indeed brought some serious issues for many communities despite the marvel it has brought for the world. To address those issues, we have to be more active and conscious, act as family and society members while also monitor our younger members online activities.
Essay 262:
It has been a while since the eco-friendly transportation "bicycle" was first introduced, and its popularity seems to have declined in many countries over time. However, some effective measures could help encourage people in society to use it more widely.
A few decades ago, the bicycle was one of the main transportations around the globe. But with the popularity of motorised vehicles, the use of cycles has decreased drastically. A bicycle, in the past, used to be considered more convenient than walking or using animal-driven transports. However, when automobiles were introduced, people switched to a faster mode of transport. Those vehicles can carry more goods at a time, and businesses embraced them without further delay. Moreover, the safety of cyclists is a grave issue when dedicated roads are not built for them. Finally, bicycles lost their appeal in many countries where people started to prioritise comfort over an active lifestyle.  
However, some useful measures can encourage more people to use this eco-friendly and healthful transport on the road again. Firstly, governments should implement separate cycling lanes that would ensure the safety of cyclists. In addition to that, providing secure parking facilities will also encourage many to use cycles. Restriction on car ownership and increasing the price of fuel would further encourage many to use bicycles instead of driving cars. Finally, awareness campaigns to educate people about the health and environmental benefits of using bicycles could be a great step to motivate more people to use this transport daily.
To conclude, a government has a great role to play to motivate its citizens to use bicycles and this would guarantee a green environment and a healthy nation. It is also expected that more people use this green transport that would save the environment and keep them fit.
Essay 263:
Riding a bicycle is good for our health and it is an environment-friendly mode of transportation. However, it is still not popular in many countries. This essay will discuss some of the reasons for this drift and several suggestions to encourage more people to use bicycles.
In several countries, fewer people use bicycles these days than at any time in history. This is because many people still believe that riding a bicycle is only a sporting or recreational activity, and for commuting they need to ride on buses, trains or drive their automobiles. Secondly, since many city areas do not have any dedicated bicycle lanes, people find it risky to ride bicycles in busy streets. Without the existence of a separate bicycle lane, some people think that cycling to work would be dangerous as they have to share the road with car commuters and motorcyclists.
The government can contribute significantly to persuade people to ride bicycles. One of the solutions is to provide separate cycling lanes for cyclists. Sufficient bicycle lanes in a city will encourage many residents to ride it for their daily commuting. Denmark, for example, has extensive bicycling lanes and that has positively encouraged citizens to cycle whenever possible. Another solution could be encouraging and informing people by launching campaigns about the positive health and environmental effects of cycling. Finally, government officials should set examples by using it daily while commuting to their workplaces. If government authorities ride cycles to offices, it is hoped that the public will also follow the example.
In conclusion, cycling is still not widely prevalent in many countries. It is because of the mindset of the people who believe that cycling is a just sport. Besides, cycling lanes are not available in their countries as well. The government should take initiatives like building dedicated cycling lanes and running awareness campaigns to convince people to ride bicycles.
Essay 265:
Despite the increasing popularity of sports events all around the world, brutality concerning those events, particularly among fans, has globally grabbed attention. This essay elucidates the wagering of fans as one of the crucial ingredients for the conflicts and then connotes that setting heavy fines by authorities is a good solution.
To commence with, we need to consider reasons for people who love sports to behave such irrationally, especially when they watch live sports. This should be examined from different perspectives to fully understand the purposes of this attitude. Monetary incentives, however, could widely be indicated as one of the chief agents for this misconduct. To illustrate, globally many people are addicted to betting on their favourite sportsmen or teams, ranging from football matches to horse riding competitions. The stress of not succeeding in their bet and correspondingly losing a great deal of money leads to accusing violent treatment. These behaviours might occur in the form of bothering or hurting other individuals or damaging public properties.
Considering the diverse angles of this social phenomenon, setting a bunch of penalties against the populace particularly in gambling acts concerning sports events somehow could result in a fewer brutal etiquette of sport competition followers. As evidence, in some countries like Iran, wagering on any incident is identified as an unruly action in terms of legal and religion alike. Moreover, heavy fines could be waiting for offenders attempting to bet on games and sports competitions.
To conclude, although the causes of violent behaviour in sports events are needed to be considered from a different angle, the financial losses stemming from losing wager can be suitably responsible for such manners. Nevertheless, it could be under control by legislating stricter laws regarding wagering, in particular, in the field of sports competitions.
Essay 267:
Education and health care are two essential aspects of every human life. Without proper education and a good health care system, no nation can sustain, let alone progress ahead. Considering its significance, some people express their opinion that it is the responsibility of the government to ensure quality education and health service to its citizens. I strongly agree with this viewpoint.
To commence with, according to the “National Sample” survey of India in 2019, people had to spend more than 35 per cent of their wages on health care and schooling. In a developing country, it is quite hard for citizens to manage it all on their own, especially since education and treatment are getting expensive every year. So, these should be free as poor people cannot afford higher education and a good health care system. Moreover, if the government provides free education, the literacy rate will surely increase and the citizens would contribute far better to the overall development of the country. So, in this way, the economy of that country will flourish day by day.
Besides, another recent survey in India shows that almost 38% of people die every year without proper treatment because they can not afford expensive medical services. Since healthy citizens are the pillar of a prosperous nation, the government should intervene and make efforts to ensure proper healthcare for all. This way the country would develop faster while citizens would not be deprived of their basic rights. For instance, many countries, that are now considered developed, has had free medical care for all citizens and that boosted up their national development over the last few decades.
In conclusion, if education and medical facility are provided by the government for free to its citizens, then a country will get more benefits from it. Education and healthy life are two basic needs of every citizen and a government is, in fact, formed to make sure no citizen is denied of their basic needs.
Essay 268:
Some people believe that a government should provide free education and health care to its residents. To a certain point, I would agree with the idea, but I also believe that citizens should take some responsibility for their children's education and treatment for the family.
For several reasons, many people believe that education and healthcare should be funded by the government and offered to the citizens without any cost. To begin with, most people fulfil their tax obligations, and they should get some benefits from the government in the form of free medication and education for their children. It is a fact that education is an essential factor for the development of a country. By providing free education to the residents it is hoped that more skilled and educated workers would be created for the country. These potential workers will definitely boost the country's economy in the future. So free education should be treated as an investment by the authority.
One of the reasons to oppose the idea is that free medical service makes some people irresponsible of their health condition. It is believed that expensive health care would force people to follow a strict lifestyle and quit bad habits. Besides, the private fund for education makes the schooling system more effective as guardians are more conscious of taking care of their children's learning. For instance, many private schools are doing better in developing countries than the state-funded schools and parents' active involvement made the difference.
To conclude, to a certain extent, I support that a government should provide free education and medication to its citizens. But I also believe that people should also be responsible for their own betterment when it comes to getting education and medical services.
Essay 270:
The gap between the wealthy and the destitute is getting wider in recent time as the rich people are getting wealthier while the poor are suffering even more. This essay discusses the problems that might arise due to this ever-widening gap between poor and rich, and solutions that could resolve the poverty problems to a great extent.
The extensive differences in social classes could cause many severe problems for a country. When the elites get richer and the low-income people get poorer, crime, inequality and violence rate increases significantly. This issue could be a threat to the country's sovereignty and stability as there might be widespread protests and riots. One of the examples is the French Revolution that was primarily caused by social and economic discriminations. During the Revolution, the gap between the rich and the poor was extensive and it had caused the unstoppable riot. The gap is responsible to brings political instability and dissatisfaction among mass people. It hinders the progress of the country as well.
The government could take numerous initiatives to resolve the issue and alleviate poverty. Firstly, the authority should make proper regulations in terms of business practice and create more job opportunities. Any monopoly and nepotism in important sectors should not be allowed. Secondly, the government must provide subsidies for low-income people. The fund for these subsidies could be allocated from income tax collected from the rich people and larger organisations. With the subsidies and job opportunities, it is hoped that the poor classes could improve their economic conditions.
In conclusion, it is undeniable that the majority of global resources are controlled by a fraction of the population and this could become a serious threat to most countries. Creating more jobs and eliminating corruption could be effective measures to address the poverty problems.
Essay 272:
Computers are extensively used these days almost everywhere. This includes banks, offices, hospitals, homes, schools, research labs, retail shops, space stations and so on. People have different views about the benefits and drawbacks of computers while this essay examines how could computers be considered an impediment.
To commence with, using computers for long hours by children is counterproductive because overuse of it can make children addicted to digital games, less enthusiastic to socialise, lethargic and obese due to the lack of their physical activities. Moreover, many children often rely on calculators and computers for simple arithmetic operations, spelling and grammatical rules. This can lead to poor academic and career performance. For example, a recent study reveals that many high school students fail to do well in mathematics due to their over-reliance on computers and calculators in early childhood. Apart from that, the health hazards that overuse of computers causes cannot be overlooked. Computers can be the reason for weak eye-sight, back pain and severe headache for the users - according to the Medical Alliance for Public Health.
Besides, hacking, spamming, and computer viruses are very common these days which can lead to fraud, data breaching and monetary loss. When someone's bank account, email, and blog are compromised, it can lead to disaster. Furthermore, online perpetrators can pretend to be someone that they are not and trap people to take unfair advantages. In addition to that, the national security of any country could be compromised due to the over-reliance on computers. For instance, “Garry McKinnon” who was accused in March 2002 of perpetrating one of the biggest military computer hacks of all time, hacked the server of “The Pentagon” and learned about the secret of the country's defence.
To conclude, every technology has both positive and negative sides and its overall impact depends on the people who use and control them. Rational and proper use of computer technology would benefit us tremendously, but it can also bring disaster when we are overly dependant on it or misuse it.
Essay 273:
Many people believe that computer technology has immensely helped the human race to progress, but others opine that it has more drawbacks than benefits. This essay examines how could computers be deemed an obstruction rather than a blessing.  
Many people are addicted to computer and Internet technology. They have no social and personal life as their screen time is unbelievably high. Without a computer, many people believe that they cannot work or continue their study. This dependency makes them less creative and more inert. For example, some people who work in modern offices cannot work when the Internet connection is interrupted. This over-reliance could bring catastrophic results, especially in sensitive sectors. A simple mistake in an atomic energy research centre can destroy millions of lives.  
Moreover, it is undeniable that the overuse of computers has health hazards. One of the examples is the radiation from the computer screen, which damages our eyesight and cause headache. It has been reported that the number of people who wear glasses has increased significantly since the invention of computers. Besides, this device has negative effects on the way people socialise and interact with each other. With the invention of portable computers, tablets and smartphones, people remain busy with their devices rather than having face-to-face conversations or social interactions. They stay indoors and scarcely take part in outdoor activities. Consequently, people's overall health condition is deteriorating and their social relationship is becoming fragile.
In conclusion, although computer technology has brought many benefits for mankind, it has many negative sides too. People's overreliance on technology mainly create those problems and it is hoped that we will use it to make our life easier, not more complex and perilous.
Essay 275:
The modern communication system, with its innovations like phones and emails, has made our life comfortable while making communication cheaper, faster and widespread. However, some people express their concern that with the dependency on such technology and tools, comes the downfall of personal relation and interaction. I, however, disagree as I believe that they do not hurt human interaction or relation, rather accelerate it.
To initiate with, emails, mobile phones and the internet help people stay connected with their dear ones no matter the distance. Before we had emails and cell phones, they could scarcely communicate with their family members. For instance, one of my cousins studies in New Zealand and he makes video calls, voice calls and sends emails and SMS to his family and friends almost daily, sometimes even multiple times a day. Thirty years ago my uncle had been in this same country, and he could rarely contact his family. A single letter he used to write sometimes took more than a month to reach his family. Thanks to modern technology, communication is more personal and more frequent than at any time in history.
Moreover, modern communication methods save time and cost to a great extent and reach beyond borders. The speed of electronic mails and phone calls are amazing. They are live and instantaneous. Many of these services are free and takes almost no additional cost than just the internet bills. This is unprecedented since in the past international calls used to cost an arm and a leg of people. With technology in place, people nowadays are making new friends beyond borders. So it would not be an exaggeration to state that technology has made it possible to keep more personal relationships than ever. For example, Facebook has helped me find many of my childhood friends, and some of them live in faraway countries, perhaps with whom I would not be in touch otherwise.
In conclusion, I would like to say that, telephones and emails have many positive impacts on our relationship and communication. Without those, modern-day communication would have been broken and infrequent.
Essay 277:
The world has never witnessed such a great influx of population from rural areas to cities that it did in the last decade, and it is still ongoing. Cities are already over-populated, polluted and cramped with an overwhelming number of people. Only decentralisation and mandatory relocation can reverse the scenario.
To begin with, only 20 per cent of the world population lived in cities at the beginning of the 20th century while this has already escalated to over 80%. This over-population in cities increases the crime rate, contributes to environmental pollutions, declines the living standard of citizens, creates cut-throat competitions and makes living cost higher. The traffic congestion is a direct result of it that kills thousand of man-hours each day. Besides, the housing problem in cities is getting worse day by day. According to a recent study, the lifestyle of cities is declining faster with the dramatic increase of its population.
To stop people from moving to metropolitan areas, the government has to adopt an effective decentralisation policy. If enough civil facilities and employment opportunities are created in the rural and suburban areas, a few people would move to cities. People primarily migrate to big cities to have better careers and earning prospects. To reverse it, the government has to start big projects to empower the rural people and forcibly move many factories and facilities to nearby countrysides. Education, treatment and entertainment facilities in cities attract many rural people and the only way to stop this influx of people is to add those facilities to the countrysides as well.
In conclusion, cities become less habitable with the inflow of mass people who come to have a better life but eventually face more problems. Decentralisation could be a very effective solution to invert this concerning trend.
Essay 278:
Rapid migration of people from rural areas to cities has created serious concerns in many countries. This essay suggests that a higher population is one of the profound impacts of this phenomenon that leads to numerous issues. It also proposes that creating facilitating, specifically entertainment and employment in rural areas, as a solution to it.
Undoubtedly, a great number of city-dwellers, particularly in megacities is a major challenge for the municipalities and state authorities, which could considerably stem from the depopulation of rural areas. As a case in point, a vast number of the country residents have immigrated to Tehran in recent years. Because of this, Tehran is one of the most populous cities which leads to higher living costs, accommodation scarcity, pollution, traffic congestions, increasing crime rates and unhygienic living standard.
Straightening out the problem of rural depopulation would not be practically simple. Yet, the government's investing in facilitating rural areas by recreation facilities and creating more job opportunities could be somehow effective in terms of persuading pastoral people rather than migrating to big cities. To illustrate, some way-out cities in Europe have implemented several projects concerning installing some recreation centres near the countries, which have notably attracted rural people. In this way, it has been possible to control the migration to cities. Besides, many rural people migrate to cities for better jobs, treatments or education. Establishing quality schools, healthcare centres, and creating more employment opportunities could effectively reduce the migration trend.                                                   
In conclusion, over-population in cities creates numerous problems that threaten the living standard of cities. One of the prudent solutions to overcome the mass influx of rural people to cities is to create more job scopes and build civic facilities for them in rural and suburban areas.
Essay 280:
Banning smoking is a controversial issue as many people strongly support this ban while others disagree with it. It has been around for centuries and in many countries, public smoking is prohibited and against the law while it is open in many other countries. There are discussions and arguments about whether smoking should be banned completely or not.
First of all, smoking is detrimental to health. It causes lung cancer which ultimately leads to death. It might take a long time to show symptoms but it always happens. Secondly, it is a waste of money as smokers spend a lot of money on the cigarette. Addiction to smoking leads to addiction to marijuana, yaba etc. Eventually, addicted people get involved in different types of crimes. They start collecting money by stealing, lying and robbing and the severity of the crime keeps on increasing. Moreover, smoking not only harm the smoker but also the people around them. Recent studies on smoking suggest that passive smoking is as harmful as active smoking.  
On the contrary, the tobacco industry is the source of huge tax for the government. Government makes the best utilization of the tax money by building schools, mosques, overhaul streets etc. Thousands of people work in cigarette-related industries and this creates huge job opportunities. If smoking is banned completely, these people will become unemployed. Another vague benefit of smoking is that smokers believe smoking refreshes their minds and relieves them from tension and stress, though it has not been scientifically proved. Some people think that banning smoking is like imposing restriction on people's freedom and they completely oppose the idea of imposing restrictions on smoking.  
Up to this point of view, we see that there are opinions for and against the banning of smoking. I believe, the government should think rationally and wisely before they make any decision about prohibiting smoking. Personally, I believe that public smoking should be prohibited and any violation of this rule should be penalized but a complete ban on smoking should be made slowly and with proper planning.
A complete ban on smoking is controversial as many people strongly support it while others disagree. In many countries, public smoking is forbidden, but it is still widespread in many other countries. I, however, believe that smoking should be banned, but it should be done slowly and with proper planning and steps.
First of all, smoking is severely detrimental to public health. It causes lung cancer which ultimately leads to death. Secondly, smoking is a complete waste of money, and addiction to smoking sometimes leads to enslavement to other illegal substances. Eventually, many addicted people get involved in different types of crimes to manage the money they need to abuse illegal substances. Finally, smoking not only harms the smoker but also the people around them. Recent studies on smoking suggest that passive smoking is as harmful as active smoking.
Having said that, the tobacco industry is a huge source of tax for the government. The authority makes the best utilization of the tax money by building schools, parks, overhaul streets and other public facilities that serve ordinary people. Millions of people work in cigarette-related industries, and if smoking is banned completely, these people will lose their jobs. Some smokers believe that smoking relieves them from tension and stress, though it has not been scientifically proven. Finally, some people think that banning smoking is like restricting people's freedom.
In conclusion, I believe that the government should take initiatives rationally about prohibiting smoking. Public smoking should be prohibited and any violation of this rule should be penalized, but a complete ban on smoking should be made slowly and with proper planning.
Essay 282:
The school environment, teachers and the curriculum play a crucial role in developing students' overall performance and personality. Having studied in both settings - all girls and mixed school environment, I have experienced the differences between these two systems. And, I believe that mixed schools offer more benefits to students.
No doubt, girls and boys are different with respect to their thoughts, preferences, physical orientations and the way they respond to different situations. Studying in a same-sex school unquestionably helps students become comfortable with their classmates and develop comradery easily. It saves them from unnecessary distractions and helps them focus more on their studies.  
However, when girls and boys study, play and work on school projects together, they learn from each other, and this activity catalyses moral respect. It allows them to understand their mutual differences better and be more considerate towards each other. The neutral treatment helps them to look beyond gender and treat individuals equally. Such students find it comparatively easier to cope with mixed-gender situations, at offices or on social occasions. Subsequently, it facilitates them with skills to create meaningful and lasting relationships with people.
Moreover, men and women share the same workspace in modern offices. Being able to work efficiently with colleagues is just as important as having the right skills for a job. Even outside the workspace, one has to interact with both genders almost on a daily basis. Thus, the mixed school atmosphere prepares students for life outside its compound walls.
To conclude, I believe that students get an opportunity to develop their overall social skills when they study in mixed schools. It exposes them to shared activities and prepares them for future job places.
Essay 284:
More than 70% of global resources and wealth are controlled by only 7% of the population and it shows the overwhelming disparity of the resource distribution throughout the world. As a result of capitalism and improper distribution of facilities and resources, the poor are becoming even poorer while the rich are amassing more wealth. This causes unimaginable problems to the human and some steps should be implemented immediately to reduce the discrimination of wealth distribution.
To begin with, the inequality of wealth distribution increases delinquency. It is noticeable that the crime rate all around the world has significantly increased as the wealthier are getting more affluent and the poor are suffering to support their basic needs. The overall development of a country does not depend on a tiny portion of rich people, rather it depends on an active economy and fair wealth distribution. Moreover, when the discrimination between rich and poor increases, the political situation deteriorates and a country steps into the verse of corruption and civil war.
To overcome the poverty problem the state must emphasise quality education. Education is the single most important answer to this problem. Moreover, the government should utilise the resources a country has and support the small and medium entrepreneurs by providing subsidies. Finally, very fundamental needs like education and treatment should be funded by the state. For example, according to a recent article in a research journal, most rich nations in the world have been successful due to their better education system and fair governance system.  
To conclude, the increasing gaps between rich and needy brings many predicaments to a country and quality education is the solution to the poverty problem. The government must ensure an active economy in the country to ensure fair resource distributions.
Essay 285:
The gap between the rich and the poor is widening fast than ever throughout the world. This enormous gap certainly causes a lot of problems that a nation must endure solving through various means. This essay discusses the problems associated with paucity and proposes some solutions to alleviate poverty.
There is almost an endless list of problems that stem from poverty. To name a few, scarcity of food, water, and clothing, weak shelters, the spread of dangerous diseases, indulgence in criminal activities, mental illness and low life expectancy. Poor people are trapped in horrendous insufficiency and cannot educate their children. The root cause of poverty is the lack of proper education and hence problems related to employment. This creates an evil circle of scarcity for poor families that they can not break. Moreover, poverty increases crimes in an area and this disturbs social harmony. Where the poor are struggling even harder to meet their basic means, the rich are getting pampered by the wealth and luxury. This discrimination can even lead to civil war.
In order to overcome the problems of poverty, governments should do a careful and considerable analysis of the distribution of funds and wealth throughout the country. Non-profit voluntary organisations should work actively in rural areas for the upliftment of the poor, mainly in education and skill development areas. Furthermore, the rich and the prosperous should contribute financially and work selflessly towards creating job opportunities and helping destitute people.
To conclude, the world would be a better place to live in only if we keep poverty from rising beyond limits. Poverty is a curse and a collaborative effort, education and employment opportunity can mitigate it to a great extent.
Essay 287:
Childhood "experience" and "learning" determine someone's personality and ascertainment to prosper in life. Some people believe that children in wealthy families are over-indulged and do not learn many important lessons to face future challenges while middle-class and lower-middle-class families better prepare their offsprings. Personally, I believe that better parenting, regardless of family wealth or status, is more important.
To begin with, children from less wealthy families learn to face difficulties in life from early childhood. They know that they need to work hard to succeed in life, and they start to appreciate the value of money and time. It gives them a competitive advantage to face life in the future. For instance, the highest scorer in our college was from a lower-middle-class family and he devoted most of his time to study. He valued excellent academic results more than most students from wealthy families. He was convinced that the only way to get out of their financial problems was to become the top scorer and have a better career in the future. No doubt, this determination, hard work and mind-setup will help him become successful in life.
Reversely, children from wealthy families, most of the time, get better facilities, education and career opportunities. Despite being an average student, Patrick, one of my classmates, got admitted to the best private university in our country. This exemplifies that he has a better career prospect than the top scorer in our college. So, the connection, influence and money that rich families own often help them better educate their children while also giving them a head start in life.
Personally, I believe that parenting is more important than having and spending money on children. It is not always the money that makes someone successful and a good citizen. When parents implant good qualities among children, these qualities alone can make a difference in their life.
To conclude, though it is generally believed that children from less fortunate families are better prepared for the future, I believe that proper parenting is far more important than any other factor.
Essay 288:
Money plays a pivotal role in people's social and family life, and it influences the way a child grows up and prepares to meet future challenges. Usually, rich families compensate better life for their children, but some people argue that children who are brought up in less wealthy families are often better prepared to face difficulties in life. However, I strongly believe that children from affluent families get better opportunities and better prepared for future challenges.
On the one hand, many believe that families with less money prepare their children more realistically. Those children admittedly learn to face obstacles in their childhood that gives them an advantage when they grow up. They also learn to appreciate the value of money, savings, time and hard work, and the importance of family tie. They are not pampered for everything they want or need, rather they need to earn them through hard work. Therefore they automatically prepare for setting a target in life and make plans for pursuing them.
On the other hand, children from wealthier families are sometimes a little behind in terms of learning many important lessons in childhood when compared with the mindset of their counterparts. However, they have all the facilities they need for their education and future career. For instance, they are well adorned to go to the best schools, have the best teachers to teach them, money and connections to start a business or join a job, and affluent family to support them whenever needed. Furthermore, those families build the foundation for their children to begin their life- a much-needed push to have a better career. These rich children eventually learn the most important aspects of life, maybe a little later than the poor children, but they have far greater facilities that ultimately give them advantages in life.
To conclude, money and education build a better future life. Because of that, wealthier children have a much better and flexible life than poor children. Therefore, I believe children from wealthy families get a competitive advantage over children from poor families in terms of education and preparation for the future.
Essay 289:
Who get better prepared to face life - people who were raised lavishly or in a destitute condition, is debatable. I agree that children who were raised in a low-income family are better at facing life than those who came from an ultra-rich family.
For several reasons, many believe that children who are brought up in middle and low-income families are better prepared to face life. Firstly, these children are accustomed to living a simple lifestyle and they know the value of time, money and relationship. Instead of having their own room, with all the toys and comfortable beds in the room, they had to sleep with their siblings in a small room with a limited number of toys and facilities. They learn how to share important things, take care of others, manage the budgets and most importantly become contented with whatever they have. As these children do not have many luxuries in life, they would easily adapt to the harsh conditions. Secondly, these children are already taught to be independent at an early age. Many of their parents could not afford to pay school tuition fees, therefore they have to have a part-time job to pay the fees. Thus they learn to be independent at an early age.
Moreover, children who are raised in rich families will face difficulties when they grow up and face the real world. One of the reasons is that their parents have always provided them with all the materials they wanted and needed. They get fancy clothes, expensive toys and the latest gadgets without having to work hard. As they rely heavily on their parent's wealth, they will face problems if there is a financial crisis.
To conclude, the upbringing of children defines who they will become in the future. Since families with less money have to teach children to work hard, save money and become satisfied with thing things they have, they are better prepared in life than their rich counterparts who got everything ready for them by their family.
Essay 291:
Shopping complexes have become more popular than local markets, especially in many cities, because of the different advantages they offer. Despite this, people still prefer local markets due to the benefits they grant. This essay will discuss the advantages of each type of marketplace. Personally, I prefer shopping centres over local markets.
On the one hand, modern shopping malls have a far better environment and a variety of shops in a single place. The shops are organised, give a better shopping experience, and save time by allowing customers to get whatever products they need under one roof. Moreover, the environment of shopping malls is way better than that of local markets. These shops accept digital payment methods, such as credit and debit cards, which is suitable for such cardholders. It is often said that shopping malls are the future of shopping while local markets are the concept of bygone days.
On the other hand, local markets also offer a wide range of advantages and products to people. The freshness of vegetables, fishes and fruits could be a great advantage of shopping from local markets. The cheap price is another reason why many people think local markets are better places for shopping. Local small business vendors sell their products in such a traditional market and they often support the local economy. Therefore, these advantages exemplify the advantages and importance of such traditional markets.
To conclude, shopping centres and local markets both have various positive aspects. The preference often depends on the type of product we buy and the convenience we seek. I believe shopping centres provide me with a better shopping experience, and that is why I mostly shop from a shopping centre.
Essay 292:
People have different preferences in term of shopping places and shopping experience. Many people choose to shop from a mall or plaza while others like to buy goods from a traditional market. The following paragraphs outline the benefits of both settings. My preference, however, is a traditional market because I like to bargain price and buy fresh products.
For several reasons, some people decide to purchase goods from a large shopping centre. Firstly, shopping in a shopping mall is safer than that of local markets. Malls and plazas are equipped with a surveillance system, while security guards make sure no snatching and robbery take place. Secondly, shopping in a mega-complex is more convenient and comfortable as most shopping malls are equipped with air conditioners that make the temperature soothing. Facilities like a play zone for children, credit card payment, cineplex, food court etc. attract many more customers.
However, some people still prefer local markets for various reasons. It is a fact that product prices in a traditional market are comparatively cheaper. Besides, many unique and traditional products are not sold in modern shopping complexes but are available in local markets. For examples, many traditional and handmade crafts are only sold in local markets, and each item is unique because it is a custom made product. Finally, the freshness of fishes, fruits and vegetables in a local market is perhaps the most significant advantage for choosing it over a large shopping centre.
In conclusion, it is undeniable that shopping in modern shopping centres and traditional markets have their own positive aspects. I personally like to shop at a local market because I could buy things at a better price and get fresh fruits and vegetables whenever I want.
Essay 294:
Schools usually deal with different academic subjects while overlook teaching money management skills. This is why many students, who do well in school, struggle while taking care of their finances in real life. Academic studies and financial intelligence cannot be seen as inherent contradictions but as two mutually independent competencies. So, I believe that the value of money and money management should be taught in schools.
The author of the book “Rich Dad Poor Dad” terms Financial Independence as you being able to make your money work for you and not the other way around. Students who get to learn about how to spend, invest and save money rarely find themselves in financial predicaments despite what their salaries bring in. Such skills are often inculcated through family and teachers. And students, who lack these skills, usually find themselves with insufficient funds no matter how much their jobs pay them. They never learn to develop their assets. It renders them dependents on their jobs for life as it is their only source of income. The earnings are mostly spent on their liabilities leaving them with paltry savings.
If money management is taught as a part of the school curriculum, all the students will get a chance to learn such skills. They will grow up to have more knowledge of money and finance. Consecutively, they will have a better perspective while making financial decisions. This will lead to a more stable, enriched and self-reliant society. Lessons learned in schools last for a long and that is why teaching money management to students is so vital.
To conclude, earning money may not be the goal in life but it is the money that provides us with our basic needs and a sense of security. Learning the skills to value and handle money is a crucial part of life. Thus, I believe that lessons for financial management should be made a part of the school curriculum so that more and more students can have a financially stable future.
Essay 295:
Money management skill is undoubtedly important, but if it should be a part of the academic curriculum is debatable. Many schools are already overwhelmed with the subjects they teach, and adding personal financial affairs to the syllabus would make things worse. Moreover, this is a skill that teachers cannot instil in a person through lectures and exams. This is why I believe that parents should take this responsibility.
To commence with, no matter how many chapters someone reads or how many exams he or she takes on the value of money in life, until this person earns, saves and invests money, it is impossible to learn the practical aspect of personal finances for him or her. Teachers are not in a position to decide whether a student should work besides study, and manage his or her finance. Parents, on the other hand, are ideal to monitor and supervise this aspect. They can teach their children the value of money and put them in situations when they need to take responsibility.
Moreover, learning to manage someone's finance is a different type of skill that class lectures cannot teach. Finally, a teacher does not know every aspect of a student's family and their financial condition. This is why the same lecture is not suitable for all students when it comes to making financial decisions. Opposed to that, parents are in a far better position to let their children learn this essential life skill.
To conclude, money management is a practical aspect of life and theoretical classes conducted by school teachers are ineffective to develop this great skill. Parents, on the contrary, should take command of this aspect and prepare their children to value money and handle personal finance efficiently.
Essay 297:
In most countries, people take a driving test before they are granted a driving licence, and its renewal does not require retaking the test. Some bureaucrats, however, suggest that repetitive tests should replace the conventional "once in a lifetime test" policy. The proposed policy has some advantages but the drawbacks are far greater.
To commence with, the repetitive driving tests seem like a solution to the increasing driving offence, but in reality, people's carelessness, violation of traffic rules and drunk driving are the main causes for most road accidents. Therefore the authorities should spend more money and manpower for ensuring road safety than retesting the driver's ability. It is a scientific fact that adept drivers are less likely to forget their driving skills unless they lose their sanity. Considering this, the authority should update the drivers about the changes in traffic rules, and make them aware of road safety, not test their ability every year. Finally, strict punishment and penalties should be imposed for the traffic rule violation to get the desired result.
Furthermore, a periodic driving test would waste people's money, time and energy on the one hand, and drain the government's budget on the other hand. According to a recent report, new applicants have to wait for several weeks to get a driving licence due to the insufficient facility and manpower, for example. Having the repetitive driving skill test would thus make this far worse and completely unmanageable.
To conclude, rather than questing people's ability to remember how to drive, strict policies and road safety should be given priority. Drivers should be educated, not tested on their ability to drive a car as this proposed policy would add burden both to the ordinary people and the authority.
Essay 299:
These days many couples decide to have babies at least a few years later since their marriage. I believe career, social changes, escalating living expenses, and increased life expectancy are some of the major reasons behind this trend. In my belief advantages of having children later in life outweigh its demerits.
To commence with, a growing number of people, including women, are now serious about their career development. This is perhaps the primary reason they do not expect to have children in the early stage of their marriage. It is intuitively obvious that with huge competition, unemployment and economic crisis, people around the world are constantly worried about their careers and salary. As a result, many decide to postpone their first childbirth. Secondly, women empowerment and social changes have altered the old way of life where a woman's sole responsibility was to look after the children. Since many wives are working these days, they decide to take babies after they reach a certain position in their career.
Furthermore, social belief regarding giving birth to children has changed dramatically, and people are more concerned about the living expenses than the number of babies they have, unlike in the past. Finally, enhanced life expectancy has also contributed to this trend as people believe they can wait a little longer to have their first baby.
Undeniably, people who choose to concentrate on their career first and then have babies can take better care of their children due to ample career and economic freedom. Having offspring early in life can escalate the expenditures and financial responsibilities of parents. Moreover, if they do not spend enough time with children, they grow up with psychological issues. Thus,  by having early children, young parents might put their careers at a risk as well as the future of their children. Reversely, having offspring in early life have few advantages. Such parents have new members in their family and their isolation would be extirpated and they will become more family-oriented.
In conclusion, despite the pleasure of having a new baby in the early years of marriage, parents who decide to have babies later can focus on their career, fulfil financial goals and have sufficient time to spend with the family.
Essay 300:
With paradigm shifts in social beliefs and people's fascination with careers, they tend to become parents at a later stage. Several reasons are responsible for this, and I believe that it has more negative consequences.
To begin with, the average year when people get married those days has increased significantly. As a result, childbirth is naturally delayed. According to a recent survey, many young people who start their career after their graduation are more focused on their jobs than having their own family. Besides, many young people are undecided whether to marry or not. Eventually, when they get married, many of them are already in their mid-thirties, and they take some time to settle and have some financial stability before having their first child. Furthermore, the old belief that a girl should manage a family and have children earlier have changed, and more wives work in offices than ever. The decline of the joint family has also contributed to this trend as couples solely decide to have a baby, unlike in the past.
If we notice the severe detrimental impacts this trend has, we would surely try to reverse it. The most cynical outcome of this trend is the number of couples who struggles to become parents. It is scientifically proved that the infertility rate among couples is higher who try to become pregnant after their mid-thirties. Some of the couples eventually break up their marriages due to this, and it brings unfathomable social problems. Furthermore, having a child in the early years of marriage make the couple more family-oriented and this eventually help them have a better future.
To conclude, late marriage, nuclear family structure, and more focus on jobs are the main reasons people become parents at a later stage in their lives. I think this trend has more adverse results than its positive outcome. So it is expected that married people would carefully consider different negative and positive aspects of having babies later in their life.
Essay 302:
Many aspects of culture and people's lifestyles are becoming increasingly similar throughout the world. Although this trend has some benefits, I would agree that the disadvantages are more noteworthy.
On the one hand, the global reach of fashion brands, similar eating habits and similar traditions of people have some major benefits. For instance, Starbucks, the renowned coffee chain, has grown from a single outlet in Seattle to as many as 30,000 shops in around sixty countries. Nearly identical stores serve cups of coffee to hundreds and thousands of customers, no matter whether you are sipping it in New York, London, New Delhi, Melbourne or Istanbul. Thus the global business opportunity enables many brands to sell products all around the world. As a result, people can enjoy fashion, food and other aspects of diverse nationalities staying at home country. A stronger bond could be observed among people no matter where they live as a consequence of their similar lifestyle. Thus the differences among nations are reducing and this is quite helpful in maintaining world peace.
On the other hand, this trend has some striking disadvantages that we should be cautious about. Firstly, the spread of cross-cultural materialistic lifestyles and attitudes makes us less human and more selfish. For example, the role of TV advertisements by global brands, in most cases, is related to the concept of materialism. We are affected by terminal materialism that forces us to buy things for the sake of buying, instead of buying for basic needs. Secondly, with the aggressive spread of market economies and communication technology, local cultures and values are in peril. The true identity and culture are in jeopardy with the influence of alien cultures and the new generation cares less about their history and tradition.
The discrimination among nations in terms of people's lifestyle, access to information, eating habits and cultural aspects are diminishing with the effect of globalisation and widespread acceptance of technology. Some people see it as a threat to cultural identity, but I take it as a positive sign in terms of improved lifestyle and a better relationship among nations. Without a doubt, the merits of this exceed the disadvantages.
To begin with, globalisation and free trade concepts, that led to the similarities among nations, were not imposed by a rich nation on the rest of the world. Rather, it was a demand of the time that has reduced the gap among countries over time. For example, someone from a developing nation, these days, can avail the same branded clothes, food, technological devices and so on a citizen in an industrialised country can have. This not only enhances the freedom of choice for people but also opens the windows of opportunity to local brands on the international stage. If countries look more similar around the globe, it means just one thing - the wealth and life standard gaps among people are declining.
Moreover, the trend reduces the cultural gap among nations and help maintain world peace. Also, a growing number of people nowadays go to rich nations for study and work, and similar culture makes them adapt to a foreign country more easily. Freedom of the press and easy access to global information has accelerated this trend and there is no stopping to it.
Finally, the culture and tradition of a nation change over time even without the interference of any alien influence. Hence restricting the overwhelming facilities this trend brings is not a good idea at all, especially when the world still has a huge wealth gap and animosity among nations.
To conclude, the wealth and power gaps among nations may lead to conflicts, and this is why people should be treated as global citizens rather than citizens of a specific country. To make this dream come true, international brands, TV channels and other global facilities should be present in every corner of the world.
Essay 303:
Differences among nations are becoming less perceptible these days as people all over the world are sharing the same lifestyle, technology, fashion, foods, advertisements, and entertainment programmes. As a result, cultural identity and traditions are in peril. The following essay advocates that the disadvantages outweigh the benefits of this trend.
The first benefit of this trend is that international brands can produce goods on a mass scale, and the manufacturing cost becomes cheaper. As a result, consumers enjoy the advantage of buying products from global brands at an affordable price. Secondly, people all over the world share the same culinary experience, and that is why they have more food options than ever before. For example, people around the globe can now purchase food based on their preference, whether it is Chinese, Indian or Western food or brands. Furthermore, this trend reduces the cultural barrier and brings people under a common platform where people will have more knowledge and respect about other nations and their customs.
On the contrary, the globalisation of the fashion, entertainment and culinary industries have some severe negative sides. First, many people abandon their cultural values due to this, which hurts the identity of a country. Besides, foreign television shows have negative influences on young people. Many global TV channels, for example, show programmes that are sensitive to other cultures. However, as these shows are easily accessible nowadays, many young people follow them, and as a consequence, adopt a non-acceptable lifestyle and life choices.
In conclusion, the globalisation of fashion, advertising, culinary and entertainment products have both advantages and disadvantages. But, carefully considering both, I strongly feel that it has more negative effects than positive aspects.
Essay 305:
Ensuring food adequacy for the entire population has been a major concern for nations throughout the centuries. Some people believe that the government should focus on producing all kinds of food while importing as little as possible to ensure food sufficiency. I firmly believe that producing many kinds of food is an inevitable effort in terms of ensuring the nation’s food security.
Firstly, the more a country relies on imported food, the more food crisis it faces. Food import includes transportation costs, taxation and other charges that eventually increase the food price. To tackle this problem, a government should allocate more budgets to improve national production by maximising the collaboration of research centres with farmers. Related university courses and diploma programmes can create more talented individuals who would be involved in domestic food production. Furthermore, by mass production of all kinds of food items, a country can prepare for the rainy days.
Secondly, by focusing on farming, irrigation and planting, a government can decrease unemployment problems. For example, in Indonesia, the farming sector creates the highest percentage of jobs. More than 50 per cent of Indonesians are directly or indirectly depends on the agriculture sector.
Finally, imported food does not have the same quality and freshness as locally produced food and crops. If food is imported from a long distance, the food value degrades and in some cases, toxic chemicals are used to preserve the imported food. Thus the local production of foods would ensure better food quality and sound health of citizens.
In conclusion, preventing the food crisis, ensuring better food quality and decreasing unemployment could be achieved if a country becomes self-sufficient in its food production. It is expected that countries would emphasize their domestic food production as it gives many competitive advantages over importing.
Essay 306:
Every country wants to reduce its dependency on imports while maximising its exports including items such as food and crops. However, not all countries have the same geographic location, weather condition, technology and suitable lands to produce each type of crop the citizens need. This is why a country should focus more on its overall economic growth rather than using manpower and budget to become self-reliant on food.
To commence with, soil, weather condition, available lands, technology and demographics of a county determine what crops, vegetables and fruits it can produce. Not all countries have the same geographical features and manpower, and thus, it is obvious that the country needs to import some of the items. In many cases, this is rather advantageous than producing or growing crops and then harvesting the grains. For instance, it is impossible for an Arab country to produce all types of foods due to its weather condition. If they focus on growing these food items and engage their manpower to do that, their economic growth would be hindered.
Moreover, a country like Germany and China can focus on manufacturing and industrial innovation while import food from other countries. The ultimate outcome is more beneficial for them. However, this might not be the case for a country that solely depends on the agriculture sector and when a majority of its population are already dependant on it. They can focus on improving their productions, but this model is not suitable for industrial countries.
To conclude, I believe that free trade and globalisation have made the world a global village. And with the speedy transportation system, food import cost has already declined. Since fulfilling the mass people's diverse needs for various kinds of food is not feasible for a country, it should focus on its true potential rather than allocating budget and manpower to become self-dependent on food.
Essay 308:
Governments, all around the world, have visions to fulfil, and responsibilities to carry on, and they seek to achieve the overall development of their countries for a prosperous future. Thus many governments think that economic progress is the key to success while others disagree with this notion and opine that many other aspects such as green environment, security, social values, traditions and peace among nations are more important. I personally believe that the economic success of a nation is an important goal for a government but it is not the most important one.
To begin with, many developed countries have already gained economic progress and yet they are suffering from growing crime rates, hostile relationship with other nations, corruption and outbreaks of epidemic diseases. Thus economic progress has failed to ensure a better life standard for citizens. It proves that only economic progress should not be the vision of a government. On the contrary, without economic stability, a government cannot ensure advancement in education, defence, healthcare, international trade and social safety.
Again, industrialisation and success in trades have ensured economic stability to many western and Asian countries, and yet the environmental damage that has been caused is overwhelming. No good money would bring to a nation if it fails to build a safe and green environment for the next generation. However, many people would also argue that it is better to bestow a prosperous country to the new generation rather than leaving them a broken economy.
Furthermore, economic progress requires industrialisations, dominance in international trade and the use of cheap labour from other countries. History tells us that wars are imminent due to irrational competition among nations. On the contrary, without economic success, a country cannot defend itself from external threats, fight epidemic diseases and cannot ensure proper health care facilities for its citizens. Finally, some would say, with the economic progress, the country will lose its old way of living, traditional values and uniqueness as a nation. But it should also be considered that change is the fundamental basis of development and if a nation worries too much about the old ways of living, it would fail to ensure progress at a steady pace.
The progress of a nation is often measured by economic growth, therefore many governments focus more on their economic progress rather than other aspects. However, some people, including me, have a contrasting view as they believe that political stability, security, social condition and education are equally important for the advancement of a nation.
On the one hand, many governments pay more attention to economic development than other aspects of life as they believe that economic growth plays an important role in the development of a nation. When a country's economy develops, it ensures business ventures, new job opportunities and the government can collect more funds through taxes. This fund could be used for the improvement of other sectors such as education, public infrastructures and military services.  
On the other hand, even though economic growth plays an essential part, governments must ensure a better living standard and a green environment. The economic condition of a country will not grow without the support of a secure social condition, better political condition and advanced educational system. Investors will not place their investment in countries that have an insecure political condition such as Afganistan or Iraq. And then, without the existence of educated and skilled workers, it will be difficult for a country to improve their industrial and trade activities. Therefore, the growth of the economic sectors should be aligned with other important sectors.
In conclusion, it is undeniable that economic growth plays an important role in the development of a nation. However, I personally believe that besides economic progress, better education, social welfare, security and political stability are equally important for the sustainable development of a nation.
Essay 310:
In recent years, the role of women in society as well as in job sectors has changed to a great extent. However, it is noteworthy that higher positions in firms are still occupied by men, although women account for half of the workforce in many developed countries. While some people claim that women should be promoted more to hold these positions, I disagree with this idea as I believe that higher positions should be served by deserving people and should not be allocated based on gender.
First, recruiting for higher positions in a company should never be based on gender, but qualifications, skills and aptitudes. This is because choosing people who cannot adapt to the working conditions will make companies confront many difficulties - even this can affect the profit, productivity and the public image. For instance, in my brother’s workplace, two women were recruited in two higher positions only because they were relatives of the owner. Within a few months, the management had to replace both of them with more competent employees. Therefore, a company should always choose the best people to serve their important positions. If a female candidate seems more promising or if an existing female employee has excellent capabilities, there should not be any problem in recruiting or promoting a woman in a higher position.
Again, if percentage or number is the most crucial factor, I believe children should also be promoted to higher positions in a company in a developing country as their percentage in factories and industries in those countries is also high. This exemplifies why qualifications should get priority over other aspects when it comes to hiring people for higher management positions in a company.
In conclusion, I strongly believe that employees should be recruited according to their expertise, eligibilities and talent. It is therefore recommended that women who want to play important roles in an organisation should gain those qualifications and skills. They should not be favoured only because of their gender.
Essay 311:
Women's contribution to building a nation is equally important to that of men, and given the chance, women can be equally adept to take responsibilities in higher management positions in a company. Gender equality is no longer a concept, but a proven way to accelerate progress. I, therefore, strongly believe that a portion of higher positions in companies and organisations should be reserved for females.
To begin with, half of the world population is women and their empowerment determines the overall progress of nations and the global economy. If these women are kept away from decision-making positions, true empowerment of nations would become impossible. To cite an example, when half of the decision-makers in a large company are females, they can bring diverse perspectives and innovation to the company. Some of the Asian countries including Bangladesh and India have incorporated reserved seats in parliaments for women, and these female leaders have done a great deal to encourage women to actively contribute to the country's politics and business sectors.
Furthermore, women in higher positions, in the police force, for example, can better understand the crimes and injustice against women and can propose better solutions to these issues. Similarly, almost every large company has a great portion of female consumers and having some female key employees would only ensure more favourable product research, planning and productions that would better serve females and ensure more loyal female customers.
To conclude, allocating a certain portion of higher positions for women is not a courtesy to the women. Rather it ensures a balanced working environment, innovation, happy female customers and women empowerment which are the key ingredients to sustainable progress and better business development.
Essay 313:
A balanced professional and personal life is the key to happiness - according to many researchers. This is why a group of people suggest reducing the office hours to 35 hours per week to allow employees to have more free time. It is undeniable that overwork causes stress and hamper productivity in the long run, but a workday of 7 hours may also reduce productivity and output.
To outline the advantages, 35 working hours per week will allow employees to allocate more time for themselves and spend quality time with family and friends. Besides, they will be inspired to take part in different social and sports activities, and that will surely improve their health conditions. Moreover, the reduced working hours means more time for resting and taking vacations, and proper rest and vacations refresh our minds. Undeniably, this has a relationship with the productivity of employees in their offices. Finally, many stress-related issues are caused by overwork, and if employees work 7 hours a day, they are less likely to suffer from fatigue and stress.
On the other hand, decreased working hours would reduce the output of employees, especially in industries and that would hike the price of different commodities. Life would become even more costly due to the increasing price. Companies, on the other hand, will have to hire more employees to maintain their productivity and thus their operational costs would increase.
To conclude, a balanced working hour is already in place, which is 8 hours per day. Employees should work effectively during office hours and leave the office in due time. Companies should not put extra pressure and engage staff for more than 8 hours a day while the government should make sure that private companies are not violating the laws regarding the weekly working hours.
Essay 314:
Different social and personal problems due to overwork are arguably the most concerning dilemmas in the modern world, both for developing and industrialised countries. It is suggested by many to have a 35-hours workweek schedule, as they believe it would help diminish many overwork-related issues. This essay will give an in-depth analysis of both advantages and disadvantages of the proposed working hours.
It seems reasonable that a shorter working week can boost the demand for new employment while also provide a healthier working condition. As workers are expected to work five hours less per week, the companies have to consider additional recruitment to keep up with the former productivity, thus help in lowering the unemployment quota. Moreover, studies have highlighted the importance of granting employees a greater amount of time for resting. Not only it will lead to better performance, but also improve employee satisfaction, from which the organisations can benefit a lot.
On the other hand, there are bound to be pitfalls once the suggestion gets passed. Economically speaking, cutting working hours can severely hurt companies’ competitiveness in the market, since they are no longer as effective. The situation may get even worse if all firms suffer from the same problem. Prices are then likely to be raised so that the expenses can be covered. Ironically, the employees, who are also customers, turn out again to be the victims of the solution suggested.
To conclude, limiting the working week to 35 hours might sound promising but there are several potential issues, which must be thoroughly addressed before the proposal could be implemented in the real world.
Essay 316:
Waste recycling and people’s participation in it is a moot issue, and a lot of arguments could be observed among people as well as in the media regarding this. Whether people should spontaneously take part in the recycling process or the government should make it a legal obligation needs a thorough discussion. I personally believe that government should impose laws and severely fine the violators to ensure proper waste recycling.
To commence with, waste recycling is done by the state and citizens are expected to properly divide the recyclable and non-recyclable wastages and pack them accordingly while dumping them in recycle bins. They are expected to cooperate greatly in the recycling process. However, it is a strange fact that many people do not participate in it spontaneously either from their negligence or from their lack of time to do so.
Moreover, it is a harsh truth that many people abide by rules only from the concern of punishment or fine, not from their conscience. For instance, when the penalty for traffic rule violation went up last year, people started following them in my city. Similarly, if laws are introduced and the authority starts penalising, more people would recycle more of their wastages.
Finally, waste recycling is a very handy process to save our environment and we already have many rules to protect our environment. While deforesting is a severe crime in my country, there is no visible law for not recycling waste. This is why people are very careless about their waste management in our country. This is why proper laws are required.
In conclusion, most of the citizens in our country already know about the importance of saving the environment and how individual efforts of recycling can improve environmental conditions. Since many of them still do not participate in waste recycling, there is no alternative than to impose laws to have this done.
Essay 318:
Learning a foreign language has many advantages including augmenting knowledge about diverse cultures, having better job prospects, fostering better cognitive development, developing effective communication skills and so on. While some people believe that the only reason we should learn a foreign language is to visit or work in a foreign country, many others opine that the benefits of learning a different language are not limited to the job and travel prospects only.  This essay delves into both points of view. My opinion is that learning a foreign language goes beyond travel, migration or job prospects.
On the one hand, it is quite natural that people want to learn a foreign language only to be able to communicate with people who speak this language. Thus a large number of people learn foreign languages like English, French, German, Spanish, Russian and Arabic to travel, migrate or find jobs in countries where people use these languages. From this regard, it seems quite logical that visiting a country or working there is the main reason people learn a second language. In my country, for example, most people learn English and Spanish while almost none learn Russian. Migration and job prospects are the reason that has established this trend, I believe.
On the contrary, research indicates that cognitive development happens faster among children who learn a second language than those who do not. Furthermore, learning a second language is mandatory in an academic syllabus and this helps us understand diverse cultural and traditional aspects. People who know more languages are capable of reading more books, and understanding the lifestyle of different nationalities. Again, learning a foreign language helps us make new friends. Thus it is evident that learning a foreign language has many other benefits as well.
In conclusion, there is no denying the fact that people primarily learn a foreign language to travel to or work in a developed country. But it is quite evident that there are far many advantages of learning a foreign language than to work or migrate to a country.
Essay 320:
Every government works hard so that citizens can commute safely and quickly while businesses get a solid transportation system for trade facilities. Thus when the question arises whether a government should focus on improving its railways or roads, people have divided opinions. I personally agree that the government should spend more money on the railway system.
Fast of all, railways offer a safer commuting experience both for the citizens and traders. The numbers of road accidents and highway casualties in many countries, for example, are far higher than that of railway accidents. Thus investing in a safer mode of transportation is a much more prudent idea. Moreover, rails cause comparatively less environmental pollutions while road vehicles are the main reason for increasing pollution and around the world.
Second, rails can carry hundreds of people and several hundred tonnes of goods at a time while road transports not built for that. Some shuttle trains are many times faster than that those of private cars and public buses. Thus improved railways would save peoples’ valuable time every day. Thirdly, rail lines are usually away from the main cities and that is why some busy cities have no other alternatives than to improve their rail transportation system. Express trains can reduce the traffic congestion in metro areas, and more investment to improve the railway is the only possible solution in many cities where population density is high.
Finally, the population of the world is increasing rapidly, and that is why investing more money in a faster and reliable transportation system is more logical than investing in the older transportation system. Railways will be the future in the transportation sector, and investment in it is the better choice for any government.
In conclusion, I believe that a government, either in a developed or a developing country, should invest to build a safer, faster and more reliable transportation system, and the railway, for this reason, should get an obvious priority.
Essay 321:
Some people believe that a government should invest more in the rail system and build more railroads rather than diverting funds to improving highways and road transportation systems. To a certain point, I would agree with the statement, but I also believe that the decision of building railways or roads should be made based on the natural conditions of the area and the preference of citizens.
On the one hand, it is understandable if some people opine that a government should expand more railroads rather than roads and streets. Firstly, it is obvious that when a country has extensive rail networks, it will positively affect the logistic cost. The selling price of many goods would be cheaper since a single locomotive could carry tonnes of crops, goods or liquor. Secondly, by building integrated subway stations in city areas, traffic congestion could be avoided. For example, as Singapore has a very good train network, called MRT, most of the people rarely drive on their vehicles. As a result, Singapore is free from traffic congestion and air pollution.
On the other hand, it is also important for a government to do some feasibility studies about the geological conditions of an area before planning to improve railroads. It is a fact that some areas might not be suitable for railways, as those areas might have swamps or rocky mountains, for example. If the government finalise building railway networks, the investment cost might be unreasonably high. For instance, Borneo in Indonesia is one of the largest islands in the world, but most of the areas are swamps. So it is not suitable for railroads but good for an integrated water and road transportation system. Finally, the preference of citizens should also be considered before investing in construction on railroads or highways.
In conclusion, a government should invest in building railroads where applicable, but should also analyse thoroughly before spending money solely on railways. The authority needs to ensure that their areas are suitable for rail networks and people prefer that transportation system.
Essay 323:
Schools are considered to be the lighthouse of a nation, and if education is the backbone of a nation, schools are the place to build it. However, the main objective of academies is a never-ending debate. I agree that a school's main purpose should be to turn students into honest and good citizens and making them ready to work for society instead of turning them into selfish money-making machines by helping them individually just to be ready to get a job.
First, the main purpose of education is to build up an enlightened nation where morality, honesty and integrity would be the key characteristics. They would keep aside their personal ambitions, and work together for the betterment of the country. Since a school is a place where pupils' education is taken care of, its chief objective should be to focus on nurturing morality and good human characteristics among the students while also preparing them for their careers that would benefit society. To exemplify, if talented and experienced doctors treat patients only for the money, healthcare for all would be a distant dream. So, to build a nation where people will help each other instead of turning into money-making machines, we should focus on our education system, especially what we teach our children.
Second, states spend a lot of money to keep the schools and their education system running. A major portion of this spending comes from the tax money. From this regard, if schools plan to adopt an education system where teachers’ sole purpose would be to teach children how to be personally benefitted from jobs or businesses, the whole education system would collapse. We have to be very careful while educating our children. What we teach them in their early stages would shape them, and if the schools fail to teach them to become ideal citizens, it would be a great concern in the future. Moreover, personal benefits, good grades and a better career should not be the main reasons children attend schools. They should attend schools to become enlightened members of society.
In conclusion, making ideal citizens and dedicated workers should be the true objective of our schools. The greater good of society, the bright and prosperous future of a nation, and the personal achievements of individuals are connected with the way we teach our children in schools and that is why our education should focus on morality and quality.
Essay 325:
Technology has given people wings to fly, but along with that, it has made them lethargic. One such technological advancement is television. With different kinds of content being lined up on television, sport is one such programme which is watched and enjoyed by all groups of people, and the ongoing craze of different sports on television has inspired the young generation to a great extent. Now the question arises if this trend is supposed to be blamed for the poor health of the young generation or not. This essay delves into this issue.
The more they watch their favourite sports on TV, the more they become addicted to watching it, whilst the evolution of sports on television was not meant to do that. The motive to promote sports on televisions was to inform people of sports activities and to instil a feeling of vigour and enthusiasm in people, particularly among young people, so that they take part in different sports. However, these days, the young generation takes watching sports on television as a leisure activity. Instead of inspiring, it has rather instilled a feeling of apathy about taking part in outdoor sports among youth by occupying their free time.
Moreover, the young one's, these days, just love to have a gala time watching sports. They no more feel the need to go out and partake in physical activities which in turn has affected their health. According to some recent statistics, more than 80% of youths watch major football tournaments on TV, a many-fold rise than the last decade, but the actual participants in football in real life have considerably decreased than our past generation.
In my view, there is no harm in watching sports on television sometimes. But if it exceeds the desired time limit then the alarm has to be raised. Along with watching sports, they should take part in these sports in the fields and outdoors.
Sport has truly become one of the most entertaining and popular television shows these days. A group of people believe that these sport shows have negative effects on young people, as they prefer to watch those games on television rather than exercising or taking part in them in their free time. To a certain point, I would agree with the statement, but I also believe that its effects depend on the personality of each individual.
It is a fact that the number of sports channels has increased rapidly in recent years. Cable channels such as ESPN, Ten Sports, Star Sports, Fox Sports and so on broadcast attractive sports and live competitions all day long. As a consequence, many young people watch television for several hours just to watch these games. The condition gets worst as they are also consuming unhealthy food such as popcorn, candies and soda when they watch these shows. Therefore, a lot of people believe that these channels have been the main cause of bad health conditions of young generation nowadays.
Having said that, these sports programmes should not be primarily blamed for youngsters' poor health conditions as there are other factors which affect the health of young people. Firstly, many parents do not teach their children about a healthy lifestyle. They let their children watch television, play video games and chat on mobile phones for many hours a day and do not take them outdoors. The popularity of different junk foods and soda is the reason many young people's health condition is deteriorating.
I believe that it depends on the personality of each individual. Some young people understand the bad effect of watching television for such long hours, but others just do not care about it. Therefore, sports channels would only be one of the factors that affect the health condition of young people but not the primary cause of it.
In conclusion, to a certain extent, I would agree that sports programmes on TV have some negative effects on the health condition of young people, but, I also believe that there are other equally and more important factors which can also lead to poor health situation among youngsters.
Essay 327:
Recently, a great number of accidents on the road have caused by the careless drivers. Some people think that giving stricter punishment is the answer to tackling the driving offender problems, however, I disagree that it is the only way.
First and foremost, even the best rules have been established and imposed it would be useless if drivers have no self-conscious in following the driving law. For example, there are harsh punishments when we are driving while drinking, but in the reality considerable road accidents caused by drunk driver still exist. Thus, the main focus of this issue is all about the awareness as a driver, not just concerning on the punishment.
In addition, a government could help to improve the safety on the road by broadcasting the background knowledge of how important it is to drive prudently. It could increase drivers' conscious about the danger that could happen only because breaking simple policy, such as the driver might take someone's life with passing the traffic light. Then, the socialisation program is probably given in the process of making their driving license card to ensure every driver would receive the information.
Furthermore, the private companies, such as IT companies and transport mode companies, could collaborate with the government to create a "Smart Transportation Mode". The new software will be attached in a car or a bike which is able to detect the speed limit of the vehicle and the level of the alcohol in driver's body and stops when it reaches a certain limit. The other possibility is that the software will turn off the car's or bike's machine if it is too close to other kinds of transportation modes or other things. Hence, one of the road accidents like a crash a can be prevented.
Essay 328:
Every year a number of wild animals are being extinct and the increasing number of endangered species worldwide is an alarming issue for us. Some people are in the opinion that we should try to save all the wild animals while others believe that we should emphasise on saving some selective wild animals.
First of all, wild animals are part of our eco-system and they have as much share as we have on this Earth. Due to exploit and overuse of natural resources by humans, many such wild animals are getting wiped out. Since we, human, are the main reasons their existence are in danger, it is our obligation to protect them. While planning and executing our steps to save wild animals, we should never select some wild animals while letting others die. In fact, it is quite unclear what would be the determining factors for our biassed selection? Many people, in this case, would argue that we should focus on saving wild animals which are fewer in numbers and have greater chances of extinction like Royal Bengal Tigers and Pandas. However, I disagree. If we take proper steps to save wild animals, that would include any wild animal found around us. For instance, if we can ensure a natural inhabitation of all wild animals and prohibit any actions that might threaten them, would actually save all the wild animals.
When saving some selective wild animals, many argue that geological garden could a safe place for them. In fact, the reality is quite contrary. We should not put wild animals in cages and should let them freely live in their natural living place. International organisations like UN, UNESCO, WWF, Wildlife Alliance etc. sometimes work on saving endangered animals but that does not restrict their activities for saving those wild animals only. They have broader plans and several initiatives for saving all the wildlife animals.
Finally, our won activities like logging trees, increasing use of cars, expanding cities, luxury, rampant hunting of animals etc. are the main threats to every wild animal in the world and the time has come for us to step forward and stop such activities. Saving every wild animal is a dire need not only to maintain the natural balance but also for our own well-being.
In conclusion, we should save every wild animal that is still present in the world. Selecting some wild animals for saving is an idea we should discard as it would bring more devastating effects than positive ones.
Essay 329:
People have different opinions about saving and protecting wild animals. A group of people believe that all wild animals should be protected while others think that we should only preserve several ones. The following paragraphs will discuss both views in detail, but I personally believe that all wild animals should be conserved.
For a number of reasons, some people believe that not all wild animals should be preserved. Firstly, they believe that the overpopulation of wild animals could become a threat for our existence. For example, should the population of Zebra and Wildebeest in Africa is protected, then the existence of these animals might become overpopulated, and as a result, they might explore the farming areas in Africa. Secondly, conserving wild animals requires a large amount of money. They believe that these funds should be allocated for humanity issues, as many third world countries are still struggling against starvation and deathly diseases.
However, others think that all wild animals must be protected. The main reason behind this view is that all of the wild animals plays an important role in the ecosystem. Should there be one of these animals extinct, then the ecosystem would be unbalanced and it might have a catastrophic effect on the environment. Another reason is that the existence of these wild animal is beneficial for human beings. Scientists have found out that some wild animals could be used as a medical treatment, such as the blood of a snake which can be used to heal skin diseases. There is another reason that forms the opinion that all wild animals are important and should be equally protected. The reason explains that if we protect some selected wild animals, others might get extinct and then we will damage the biodiversity of the world.     
In conclusion, a number of people believe that we should protect all wild animals, while others think that we should only preserve some of them. Both groups have their own opinions, but I strongly believe that we should conserve all wild animals.
Essay 331:
Without any doubt, education is the key to development for a nation and only a well-educated nation could thrive for excellence and ultimate development. However, when the discussion topic is whether education system is the only critical issue for the development of a country, I quite disagree with this view. I personally believe that citizens’ skill development, increasing export, international relationship, better life standard, better utilisation of internal resources, technological development are other important and critical factors which must be combined with the educational system of a country for its  true and sustainable development.
First of all, education is considered to be the backbone of a nation and it is quite obvious that education system of a country has an immense role in the overall development of a country. Most of the developed countries have well-educated citizens and exemplary education system – which represents the importance of education system for the development of a county. However, there are countries like Sri Lanka with an educated nation and better education facilities and still suffering from poverty and struggling to become a developed nation. This indicates that education system could never be the only consideration for development.
Second, only better GDP and revenue reserve cannot be the true indicators of the development. Overall life standard, healthcare facility, safety, freedom of speech and thoughts, sustainable economic growth and a healthy environment are also important for a country to become a developed one. For instance, many middle-eastern countries have a huge reserve of foreign currency and source of national income and yet their citizens suffer from war, chaos and they have little freedom of thoughts. Such a nation might have a very strong economy and superior education system, but peace is absent there. Thus I do not recognise them as developed countries.
Japan, does not have a strong educational system comparing with many other European countries and yet they are one of the richest and most developed countries in the world. They have properly utilised their possibility, national resources and have maintained a better global trade relationship. This country is a prime example of how skilled and hard working citizens can help improve their nation.
Finally, many Asian countries have gained prominent economic growth in the last few years by adopting latest technology and they are soon going to be developed countries. They, no doubt, have improved their educational system over the period but they have not relied on this single factor. Increasing export, international relationship, better leadership and democratic government are some other crucial factor for many other countries to be promoted as a developed country.
In conclusion, I believe that a better education system, along with skilled population, better leadership, international trade and relationship, better lifestyle, freedom of speech, technological development, enhanced export and utilisation of internal resources can make sure the development of a nation, not alone.
Essay 332:
Nowadays, many people give much more focus on how to create the better education system in order to ensure the country's development. A majority of people believe that the education system is the only essential method for that, however, I do disagree with that statement.
First and foremost, even the best education system could be useless if many people still live in the poor condition. They have to work hard to continue their life consequently they prefer avoiding the education because time spent in schools could be used to earn money. Subsequently, the education system will not increase significantly like the prediction of the people. If a country fails to ensure enough job opportunities, an educated future generation will make much more problems than predicted since neither will they get involved in works like irrigation nor will be able to manage a suitable job.
Furthermore, development of a country would probably be achieved slightly by tackling the urgent factors like famine and health care issues. Those factors are more crucial than the education system. The excellent intelligence which we have gotten through education will be of no importance if we are in unhealthy.  Nutrition, sports facilities and vocational training are thus more important in this scenario.
Developed countries like the USA, the UK, Australia, Canada, and Japan have more educated citizens than that of underdeveloped countries. However, they can nowadays ensure proper education system only because they had been able to ensure basic human needs properly first. Countries like Sri Lanka and many others have higher education rate than many developed countries and yet they failed to become affluent nations.  Thus, before people go too far to focus on th education system, they should have covered all of the fundamentals first.
In conclusion, education system, no doubt, is a very important factor for the overall development of a nation but this is not the only factor for the development. Many other important aspects must be considered and implemented for the real development in a county.
Essay 333:
Many people believe that education is the most important factor for a country's development. I personally agree that education is one of the most important components for the growth of any country, but there are other crucial factors that should be considered by the government and the people. The following paragraphs will explain in details about both views and will show my position on this issue.
On the one hand, it is true that education plays an important role in the progress of a nation. As more and more people become educated, common society issues will soon be decreasing. For example, in the past, the percentage of illiterate people in China was around 50%. Consequently, many of the people were living in poverty as most of their occupation were low skill workers with low incomes. But then the government realised these inconvenient conditions and tried to develop the education system. Some of the programs were giving free educations for the children and providing scholarships for scientists and engineers. As a result, the country has experienced a significant increase in the economic sectors, and now China plays a significant role in the world economy.  
On the other hand, there are other factors that should be improved and one of them would be health. Countries that have a good healthcare system will have healthier residents which affect the productivity of the labours. Another crucial factor would be technology as it plays a significant role in the development of a country in this modern era. For example, agricultural countries that use technology for their farming activities will be more productive than the old fashioned ones. As they use tools such as tractors and bulldozers, they will be faster in planting and cultivating their lands compared to the traditional ones.  
In conclusion, I disagree if education is the only factor that would develop a nation. I do believe that education plays an important role in the development of a country, but there are other factors that should be considered by the government as well, such as health and technology.
Essay 335:
The significant rises of the population, fast paced life, crime rate and dependency on technology in the urban areas make more people become unacquainted and unfriendly to their neighbours. However, there are measures that can be taken to alleviate this issue.
In today’s technology dependent era, people are mostly busy with their own work. Major streets in the cities are filled with busy people walking fast to reach their office or business place. They are even busy talking to their office colleagues and family members over the phone. After they return home late evening, they watch television, use computer and the Internet or spend time with family members. They scarcely have any time to socialise with neighbours. In some scenarios, people do not even know who live next door in city areas. These are the everyday scenarios in the cities where social interactions could be rarely seen as individuals have no time to socialise and much focused on their own work or personal interests.
Again, the rampant acceleration of crimes in the urban community makes individual become unnecessarily cautious and suspicious about other people, especially with the people they meet for the very first time. Even trusting their own neighbourhood would be tough for them as they are in constant fear of being harmed. As a result inhabitants of cities tend to become isolated as they are afraid to mingle because of undeveloped acquaintance. Unlike rural areas, where comparatively fewer people live together, city areas are highly populated and it is not unlikely that several thousands of people live in a block. Maintaining social relationship with all of them is this thus quite impossible.     
On the other hand, considering possible measures to improve a sense of community in the neighbourhood community officials must organise programmes regularly to encourage camaraderie. Secondly, building more parks, social gathering places, community centres and children’s playground in the community could be a good measure to let people socialise and know each other. This is also helpful for meeting friends, bonding with family and neighbours. As a result, people living in the community would develop a sense of friendship. Positive news and events among community members should be highlighted in media to eradicate the fear people have about unknown people. Finally, organising different community groups to help people find others with same interest and to share common passions is a very effective measure to help people enhance their neighbouring bonds and relationship in my opinion.
To sum it up, city life and overwhelming population should not be hindrances to our sense of community and our relationship with our neighbours. It would be nicer for the community to develop a friendly environment to create a better place to live in with all the neighbours.
Essay 336:
People have different views about grouping students in different classes- some prefer this grouping based on students’ academic skill while others prefer mixing students in a group. Although there are some good reasons to think that students with same performance level and ability in a group have more advantages, in my opinion, a mixed-ability education system should be carried out in schools.
For several reasons it can be argued that student segregation by grades and same ability should be allowed in schools and should be grouped together. Firstly, high performing groups can be taught at a right speed by teachers. Who then would be able to plan their lecture by looking at students capability of how quickly they can absorb knowledge and new lessons. This will allow teachers to cover the course at a faster pace. Secondly, high-achievers will be more motivated if they are acknowledged as the most intelligent, talented and gifted peers. This sense of being superior will also help them to work hard and eventually become a successful, prosperous and competitive member of the future workforce. If a classroom has students of similar abilities and learning capability, they find it more interesting to perform and excel in their studies. The teachers do not need to put any special emphasis to teach them which is quite helpful for a good learning environment.
However, I believe in the current system of mix education in schools, where students with different academic capabilities are being taught in the same class. Students in this system will be more confident and more competitive if they are not subject to grading based segregation. Less capable students would have more opportunities to interact with brilliant students if both are being taught in the same group. So it will not only encourage cooperation but also competition with their class-fellows. Furthermore, segregating less capable pupils in mid-range or lower level groups would cause resentment in them with lower self-esteem. This is because children do not really want to be seen as less intelligent or less privileged. Also, they are prone to be violent or get involved in a gang culture just to make themselves prominent in society or to satisfy their confidence. Some low-achievers might end up attaining worse grades than before since a sense of competition is less likely to be found in the class of less capable pupil. Also, comparatively less intelligent students will not get the confidence of competing in the job markets in future, if they are kept in low-quality classes.
In conclusion, grouping pupils by their achievement level have few positive effects on high performing students but still this is a harmful way to education a nation. I would rather argue that mixed-ability oriented classes should be encouraged in schools as it will benefit all students.
Essay 338:
Latest technological inventions like mobile phones and computers have made communication much more convenient, easier and less expensive. Some people consider it as the revolution in the communication system, while some others opine that this advancement has reduced our bonding and made our relationship less personal. There is no double that with the widespread usage of cell phones, pagers, text messages, social networking websites and Internet calling, letter writing has already become less popular but I do not agree that this it will ever disappear.
To begin with, letter writing is a traditional way of communication among people from different parts of the world. Even until now with the dominance of technology like email, letter writing has its importance and supremacy in authoritative, official and personal communication. Letter writing is still the best way to congratulate someone, write to a government office or to write to a dear friend.
Second, it is a formal writing and some business companies ask their applicants to write an application letter to measure their capability in communicating by means of writing. Secondly, letter writing can be a source of documentation that can be utilised as strong evidence in the court. Email fraud is common these days and someone with advance knowledge can send an email from any email address he wants. This makes an email less authoritative as strong evidence.     
In addition, people applying for fiancée visa can send love letters to the embassy as proof of the relationship to a foreign individual as additional documentation purposes. Thirdly, individual living in a remote area of a countryside still need to write letters since the Internet is yet to be available there. The number of such areas is quite large and they rely on letter writing for communication. Thus, people prefer to use letter writing as a form of sending important messages- be it to love one’s or business transaction purposes. The personal touch, affection and sincerity a hand written letter can convey could not be found in an email or text message.
Lastly, letter writing is the only way to improve someone’s writing skills. Computerised grammar and spell checking facilities are often the reason many modern-era students do not have excellent writing and grammatical command. On the other hand habit of letter writing enhance someone ability to write better. It will also help them become more creative and imaginative in creating a very excellent output of writing.
In my point of view, letter writing will not be abolishing in future because it possesses a significant importance in communication, especially in measuring the ability of individual’s writing, creativity and appropriate and clever way of writing. Letter writing is entirely beneficial in honing to become an effective communicator. The importance of letter writing in offices, courtrooms, among friends and lovers will always help it to survive.
Essay 339:
With the development of new technologies, people’s life is now more comfortable than it was in the past. In these days it is almost unimaginable that one modern household functions without refrigerators, washing machines, microwave oven, and other appliances. A rapid development of these technologies brings with itself a lot of advantages, but negatively effects these useful technological devices have on humans and environment could not be ignored.
With today’s available consumer goods, people do not have much trouble to keep their foods or clothes in the condition that will be useful for them in every occasion. Time spent in preparation of food, washing or ironing of clothes, is far less these days than it used to be in the past, and thanks to new technologies. Just hundred years ago it was unimaginable that you could keep your meats and other food items for months, to prepare some meals in just a couple of minutes or to wash a large number of clothes in just 30 minutes. That is the biggest advantage of these consumer goods, Modern people spend far less time in doing house chores than they used to. In this way, people can save time, and time is the most valuable aspect in the modern society.
But, on the other hand, use of appliances in such huge quantity brings with itself higher energy consumptions that lead to a higher environmental pollution all around the world. Since most of our energy is produced from the fossil fuels and coals, further increasing of energy consumption will lead to greater consumption of these non-renewable resources of energy which harm our environment. Even today the Earth is on the highest level of pollution in its history. So it is understandable why people warn on use and overuse of consumer goods.    
At the end, modern appliances are invented to make people’s life easier and they are successful in that, but the question is- 'what cost it will bound us to pay?' I am sure that in the future these consumer goods will be more energy efficient with lesser energy consumptions for their work, and that will still make the life of people easier and more convenient like they do today.
It is a fact that more families these days have electronic households such freezers, vacuum cleaner, hair dryer, room heater, water heater and laundry machines than ever before. This trend has some positive and negative aspects but I personally believe that it has more disadvantages than advantages and this is due to the environmental damage they cause.
It is noticed that the number of families that have consumer goods at their home has increased rapidly in the past few years. The main reason behind this trend is because of people’s busy lifestyle. They have less time to do their household activities and therefore they are relying on their electronic devices. For example, city people who are busy with their works are relying on their microwave oven and cooker for preparing their meals. The oven could be utilised for preparing instant food which would save some time for them. Therefore, some people believe that the existence of electronic household devices brings a lot of benefits for them.
On the other hand, another group of people believe that it is not a good trend because they think that these devices could have some negative effects on the human body. For instance, devices such as microwave ovens or refrigerators produce radiation that could result a serious threat to the human body. In such cases, the usage of microwave oven has triggered serious diseases such as tumour and cancer. Another example would be about the usage of CFC as it is used in electronic products such as air conditioner and freezer. Many people do not realise that the usage of CFC has a fatal effect on the environment, as it triggers global warming. No doubt the modern electronic devices that we use daily have made our life easier and brought many luxuries in our life but the damages those devices cause is a big threat in our existence.    
In conclusion, it is true that the number of people who own electronic household devices has grown significantly in the past few years. In spite of all the benefits, I personally believe that it has more drawbacks for our life, as these electronic products could have some serious effects on our body and the environment as well.
Essay 341:
With around eight billion population in the world, many cities have little spaces to accommodate the growing number of population and their housing. Thousands of people are moving to the urban areas each day for better jobs, modern facilities, education and healthcare services only to increase the woes the cities already have. To solve the housing and other pressing issues due to the booming of the population, many people opine that constructions of new cities near rural areas is the best solution while others have a different view on this. The second group supports regeneration of cities rather than building new towns close to country sides. Establishing new cities in the vicinity of the countrysides has its advantages and drawbacks.
First of all, building new cities near the countrysides would require a huge budget. Since many underdeveloped and developed countries already have a scarcity of budgets even to support the basic needs of citizens, taking such initiatives would uplift their debts only. Besides, constructing new cities close to country sides would require destroying farming lands and natural geography which will have severe consequences including deforestation and degradation of lands. Further, such cities would be far away from the main cities and if the government fails to provide every facility that the already established cities have, people would not stay there and this possess a chance of the wastage of money in the long run. Finally, many cities already have severe congestion problem and building such new cities near rural areas would make the situation worse as people’s necessity for commuting to these new cities would increase.
On the other hand, accurate planning and proper execution of establishing new cities near rural areas rather than regenerating existing cities have many merits. First of all, this would be an excellent way to solve the housing problems many cities have. If the government can ensure proper facilities in the newly constructed cities, the pressure on current cities would decrease tremendously. This would result in less traffic congestion, decentralisation, less pollution and better life standard in both types of cities. Newly built cities would open many new job facilities and that would help the adjacent rural areas to develop as well. No doubt the constructions would require a huge budget, but the government will have an excellent opportunity to control many business sectors there to earn a steady revenue. Finally, these new cities would have modern buildings and new constructions which would fight better against the natural calamities like the earthquake.
In conclusion, building new cities near rural areas is a plan that can bring many amenities both for the citizens and the government in a country. It can be an excellent way for solving housing and pollution problems in existing cities though some negative consequences of this plan should be taken into consideration.
Essay 343:
Quality health care is a basic need for all citizens in a country regardless of their economic or social statuses and the government should take every effort possible to ensure superior health care facilities for all of its citizens. I quite agree with the notion that government is responsible for ensuring high-level health care service of all its citizens, no matter what their economic levels are.
First of all, every government has a responsibility to ensure some basic needs to its citizens and health care is one of the most important aspects that a government should take care. Only a corrupted and inefficient government would discriminate among its rich and poor citizens and thus would build a country where rich will enjoy all the facilities while poor people would be deprived in every step.
Second, in this modern era, most of the countries, specifically in democratic countries, have a government selection model where people decide who would rule the country. The participating parties give their agenda and the list of developments they would implement for the progress of the country. In most of the cases high-level health care facility gets special emphasise in their pre-election agenda and if the government fails to ensure this facility, it is kind of a violation of their promise to the whole nation.
It is not unlikely that the government cannot offer better healthcare facilities in public hospitals while the rich people get far better treatments and diagnosis from the private healthcare facilities. This is a scenario which is quite unexpected and should not be the case in an ideal legislative system. All the citizens in a country are equal to the law and constitution and the facilities they are expected to get from the country has no way to be different.
In conclusion, when people need to spend a lot of money to get quality health care service, then we can easily assume that the government has failed to establish a proper healthcare sector for all the people. In the same way ensuring quality health care facilities to all the citizens of a country is a responsibility no government can deny.
Essay 345:
Many foreign universities have a dual policy in case of their tuition fees as they charge foreign students higher than the local students. International students often need to pay up to 400 percent more than local students when it comes to higher education in countries like Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the UK. This is also the case in many other countries and a government's obligation to its citizens, enforcing national privilege, tax payment by the local people and restricting the numbers of international students are the main reasons, I believe.
To begin with, different tuition fees for local and international students gives an impression that ‘you are not equal’ and when we are fighting for the equal rights in every country, the discrimination in the university tuition fee seems like an unfair one. However, the university authority often states that this is a policy that actually ensures better educational environment and fairness in the university campuses. First reason they mention for the different higher education fees is the government’s obligation to its citizens. A government has a natural obligation to education its citizens while educating foreign students is not a direct obligation it has. This also ensures that a government is enforcing the national privilege to its citizens while using the extra money earned from the international students for the improvement of the university education. Third, citizens of a country pay the tax to the government and thus should get the privilege in educating their next generation. Finally, higher university education costs help to control the international students' flow in a country.
To conclude, providing some opportunities to the local university students is not a bad idea but imposing up to 5x charges to the international students is an unfair policy in my opinion. It's unbelievable how far the university authorities are willing to push international students to get their pay and earn the extra money. In this age of globalisation and equal rights, this is not justified at all.
Essay 347:
It is safe to say that robots and other powerful and intelligent machines will accompany humans even more in the future, and they will perform duties that historically belonged to us. As a result, we will enjoy more time off. To my mind, this evolution has its pros and cons which I aim to analyze in this essay.
On the one hand, undeniably people will receive countless benefits when robots take over their usual tasks. With the massive span of free time, people can have many recreational activities that they could not fulfil in the past - like travelling for longer periods of time. This tendency is expected to come along with the development in the service industry that accounts for a high percentage of a country's GDP. Additionally, the workforce is facing contentious problems regarding their mental and physical health, once robots and smart machines come under usage, the workers will no longer be worried about such illness which will reduce the burden on the medical system as well.
On the other hand, all the drawbacks of it can not be contained easily, it has been proven by science that humans only survive by working, while they are working on their jobs, their body parts are also working, that is what keeps them healthy and physically controlled. But if our tasks are fully done by robots, we will become lethargic and it is extremely negative for our health. People also find happiness in their jobs, which means if they have too much time relaxing, they might end up feeling bored rather than satisfied.
In conclusion, I believe that robots replacing humans in daily tasks can be positive and negative at the same time. Humans should try to balance the amount of robot-completed work with self-completed work in order to terminate all the shortcomings.
Essay 348:
We live in a modern world where the domination of machines is notable to an extreme extent. A wide variety of machines is already performing numerous tasks in a perfect manner and at an unbelievable speed. The sole aim of the machines is to offer us comfort, and in the future, we will have more leisure hours as machines will do most of our tasks. But this comfort and free time will come at a cost. This essay outlines both the benefits and problems of this.
To commence with, machines are meant to ease human activities and in the future, more powerful machines will evolve to do most of our works. Usually, machines are able to perform tasks faster and more accurately than humans, and in the future, they will just do that. So, they will be considered the substitute for humans in many tasks which require arduous labour and physical challenges. At the same time, machines are great multitaskers. For instance, a computer can analyse a massive amount of data in a single second. This is why in the future, machines will be used in production, cleaning, constructions, war, research, and as a result human will have more leisure time.
On the contrary, there are some detrimental impacts of machines doing most of our tasks, and this will be severe in the future. Certainly, machines will relieve us from repetitive tasks, but they will create some complexities too. When people will leave manual works, the risks of health disorders will increase. They may get affected with several life-tolling diseases for physical inactivity that they used to do before engaging machines for their comforts. Besides, I believe that machines will also cause severe unemployment in many sectors. When machines will be used for large-scale production in factories, many human labours will be eliminated from those jobs. The dependency on machines would be extreme and due to this a single instance of failure or wrong instruction would bring catastrophic results.  
To conclude, I think it is imperative to deploy machines in only some specific sectors which are beyond the reach of humans. Further, the increased leisure will make life boring for us, and so we should be engaged in the ordinary tasks to enjoy a happy and healthy life.
Essay 350:
It is true that a large number of people decide to take part in a career and earn money while the intention develops from the early stages of their life. As a result, they are happy with their working life. The view may vary but I completely agree to this.
Frequently, the dream of taking up a career begins in early part of life. When kids are in schools, they compose essays on ‘Aim in Life’ where they mention about intentions to do in their adulthood. Consequently, they try to get into the track they cherished and most of them win the career and grow well in all terms. So, when they are in desired track, they are satisfied with their working life. The early career gives enough time for thinking or even switching career. People who start working at an early stage have better skills and better control of their professional life.
In opposite, in my life, I have met with some unhappy people with their career path. They blame misfortune because they wanted to take something else as their career but they are to work on a completely different track which brings the sense of dissatisfaction. For instance, a science graduate who is a friend of mine is now handling banking transactions and an English graduate friend of mine is solving Chemistry problems in a lab! It really turns troublesome for them to bring satisfaction in their career as neither they were ready to deal with the matters nor they had intentions. Most of these people start their career at a later stage and become stuck to something.  
For a satisfying working life, I believe, people would like to have some specific issues in line with their regular salaries like a cosy working environment, flexible working hours and some extra benefits etc. If they have the facilities, they would be able to focus more on the work which gradually will bring the sense job satisfaction. However, my personal experience taught me that job satisfaction for all employees ios not possible and people's expectation for their jobs vary to a great extent. Nevertheless, my personal opinion is that a contented employee would usually seek for job security, better salary and health working environment.   
To conclude, it should be kept in mind that we work to live a happy life, and if the working conditions can enhance the living we become happier. Starting a career at an early age has several advantages and happy employees are those who feel secured at their jobs and get a better salary.
Essay 352:
Everyone wants to maintain a perfect health but it is difficult to obtain this especially in this modern era with a changing lifestyle where people remain busy most of the time. So, the adults engage in different sports and pastimes to stay fit and healthy. But both sports and pastimes have advantages and disadvantages. A brief of the matter is discussed below.  
First of all, tennis is preferred for its several advantages. It helps to make the body fit and reduces risks for diseases like diabetes, heart disorders etc. Overall mental health is also achieved from this sport. But the most important disadvantage is – tennis is not fit for everyone. Adults over 45 are suggested not to participate in tennis. They might be unable to stroke with the heavy racket or may not move in the court speedily. Besides, this is a costly sport as well.
Second, walking is a very good form of physical exercise and applicable for people of any age. It helps to reduce weight, burn fats and maintain a healthy lifestyle. But it has some demerits as well. Extensive walking may weaken bone joints. Besides, walking provides a slow benefit. It reduces weight in exchange for longer times. My dad takes a morning walk every day to shed his extra pounds but the results are unremarkable. He has been walking for last three months.
Finally, people join clubs for passing leisure hours. It offers recreational acts like playing cards, having a group chat etc. Such events develop a sense of comfort to the club-goers. In fact, a club improves mental faculties. But there are no physical benefits as it is derived from physical movements.
At the end, I believe physical activities should be taken to maintain a healthy living and lifestyle. Only fit people may seek the opportunity to join a club as they need less physical movements. Besides, the remaining people should take sports but after their physical strength and ability.
Essay 353:
We all dream of a peaceful and happy life but often the life is disturbed by the crime and criminals. As a result, the quality of life becomes poorer. It is more prevalent in the developed countries. There are several causes that lead to the problem and those are described in the following paragraphs in brief.
Lack of childhood parental care is one of the leading issues for crime in the developed countries,- believe many social activists. Kids exercise violence from their high schools and it happens as they lack the right guidance and parental care. Since they are not taken care by parents, they commit different sorts of crime and there are lots of examples in Europe and the USA where the young people have been found guilty in different crime situations – even in murder.
Secondly, I believe, insecurity and discrimination lead people to break the law. When they cannot get their rights as they were supposed to be, they try taking control of the rights themselves which consequently leads to criminal activities. A kid of a single mother or single father family is more prone to commit crimes and a 1983 study reveals that 60% of child abuse occurred in such conditions by the mother or the father which lead to a behavioural disorder among them and inspire in violating the law.
So, solving the issue appears really daunting as the problem did not grow overnight. The corrective measures should come first from the family. When a child will know about its social responsibilities and how things work, it will behave in order. The parents, teachers and other relatives have to take responsibility for children to make them better citizens. The government must make sure that the citizens have the access to proper education and other human rights. A combination effort of both people and the government is required to tackle the crime.  
In summary, a sense of security should be developed among adult people feeling threatened by the society and thus they could be prevented from being outlaws. I think some motivational attempts from government may be helpful in this case in line with the parental care.
Essay 354:
When it comes to fashion and new trends, one of the most significant factors come to our mind is that many individuals excessively follow the most novel fashions ranging from outfits or hairstyles to home design. In this essay, some reasons behind this phenomenon and some serious drawbacks contributed by this habit are going to be discussed.
People’s notion of beauty could be the main incentive for spending time and money to follow latest fashion and styles. To achieve it they do a lot of things including purchasing branded dress, shoes, ornaments and regularly visiting beauty parlours, spa centres and so on. Being beautiful and attractive is one of the most delightful feelings which human-being are keen to experience. Having updated styles in terms of appearance could widely gift such feeling. Moreover, many people believe that fashion not only could be a factor of beauty but it also helps them to obtain the individuality and uniqueness in their community, at least in visual aspects.
Many people are heavily influenced by the famous celebrities they like and try to dress like them. Teenagers sometimes follow the latest trends without any particular reason and sometimes to be different from others. Some people are in fashion industries and they try to present their unique identity by following the latest fashion design. Finally, television programmes and advertisement have a great influence on people and these people simply want to be more attractive by following the latest fashion.  
Despite a diversity of superficial merits of excessive attention to fashion, it seems that its obvious disadvantages strongly draw societies’ care. For one, because of the fact that acquiring the latest fashion facilities entails a great deal of money, people are impelled to spend much of their budget for fulfilling their to look attractive. Furthermore, wasting time for thinking and searching in fashion world could be mentioned as another demerit of such time-consuming activities. By the way of illustration, one of the serious complications for parents is to tackle their children wasting time in shopping centres or surfing on the Internet pursuing the newest clothing etc. Fashion and latest trends are not restricted to hair style or costumes only. Piercing, tattooing, wearing bizarre materials are some other trends that often create social and family issues in many societies.   
In brief, possessing elegant appearance and/or trying to be matched with the community could be some of the crucial elements of surfing in fashion-world and pursuing fashion excessively could lead to multitude impacts on individuals social and personal life alike in long-term.
Essay 355:
Industries and businesses are the primary concern in many cities as they make the city more congested and pollute the environment in one hand, while creates job opportunities and contribute to the development of the city on the other hand. Many of the enterprises are operated and promoted in bigger cities only. Encouraging them to move to regional areas is a good idea. I believe that has more benefits than drawbacks.
There are several advantages why industries should move to the regional areas and the government should take initiatives to do so. The most important aspect is the development of the regional areas. Setting up of the enterprises in the rural area will help to develop the basic infrastructures like transportation facility, electricity and road in the rural areas. In addition, the people of this area will have the golden opportunity of employment and that would enhance the living standard as well. Moreover, the economic activity of the area will increase and that would let the government take further initiatives in order to develop this urban area. The various types of small businesses and industries like hotel, lodge, suppliers will emerge and that will support other businesses and add value to the economy of these areas.
Regional offices are often helpful to expand businesses and to reduce the manufacturing and operating cost. Thus many big industries would be actually benefited from this. Again the pressure on the big cities would reduce and that would lessen many serious issues like pollutions, traffic jam and waste management.
Despite this, there are several disadvantages of moving the businesses and industries to regional areas. One of the prominent drawbacks is the exploitation of natural resources. The industry will use the various kind of resources such as forest, water resources which will cause the environmental degradation like pollution, climate change and much more. The gradual increase in the number of population in such urban areas will increase the crime rate. Finally relocating an industry to a different place involves a huge amount of costs and the industries would not want to spend this amount naturally.
All in all, comparing the good look and bad look, I think that the government must encourage the selected industries and businesses to move to regional areas where they would operate in a better fashion for the overall betterment of economy and environment and population.
Essay 356:
There is no doubt that some young students are encouraged to work or travel a year after finishing high school. Some people assume that such a step is so beneficial to students while others oppose such ideas. In my point of view, I think this idea has both advantages and disadvantages.
An advantage of travelling or working just after high school and before attending university is the change to learning new things and gaining valuable work experience. When young people decide to work instead of getting straight to the university, they will get accustomed to the work environment and learn about several skills upon which they can build their future. In this way, it can be definitely assumed that they will be more than ready for any future work, be it a university study or any other job. For example, my brother preferred to work when he finished high school with the aim of learning new skills. Upon completion of high school, he easily found a suitable job and impressed the employers with his experience while also attending his university classes. 
On the other hand, travelling or working instead of focusing on the university education has some negative impacts. When young people prefer to travel just after completing their high school, they may encounter cultural shocks. For example, one of my relatives decided to travel in young age and due to his immaturity and lack of knowledge of the outside world, he was utterly shocked by the customs and the way of life there. He was unable to get familiar with that community and was completely disappointed since he was unable to stay there. Consequently, his decision was against him because he did not get any benefit from his travelling.
In conclusion, no one can deny that travelling or working during high school has its positive and negative impacts. So, high school students are highly recommended to know their abilities and readiness before embarking on working or travelling in order not to be shocked or otherwise.
Essay 357:
In today's modern world, many students are planning to further their studies immediately after they finish school. However, there are a handful of people who assert that young teenagers should be given a chance to travel or work for at least one year before they really attend a university. Thus, it is important for us to establish both the positive and negative impacts on young people who plan to go on a trip or start to work before starting their tertiary education.
Undoubtedly, there are numerous benefits if young people were to work or to travel around the world after they finish school. To begin, working or travelling helps the students to gain precious life experiences which are not available on textbooks. To illustrate, when young adults come out to work before attending a university, they are actually being offered a valuable opportunity to get into contact with others. It is crucial for them to develop interpersonal skills which play an indispensable role in their studies and their prospective jobs. In addition, if they were planned to go on a trip worldwide, they would, unquestionably, learn about the cultures and traditions of the locals which may be slightly or totally different from theirs. It, indirectly, widen their horizons and may help them to reduce the experience of culture shock when they arrive in a new place in the near future.
Nevertheless, a coin always has another side. If they decide to work or to travel for a year, they may graduate later than their peers. The statistic of recent research conducted in Columbia has shown that memorising and interpreting abilities of a student deteriorate as they grow older. In other words, it means that they are likely highly not to achieve their aspirations due to the continual weakening of the mental abilities of their brains. Besides, they may have forgotten about the foundation of certain subjects that they have learnt in secondary school. Again, it will probably lead the students who start their tertiary education late fail to gain success in their academic performances.
In conclusion, although there are both benefits and damaging consequences if they travel abroad or work after they finish school, I believe every individual can still strive hard and achieve their set goals regardless of life experience and age. Our nation will continue to prosper and flourish in the decades to come if more educated and knowledgeable generations are being raised up.
Essay 359:
Nowadays, it is a unanimous notion that for some people that the legislation about marriage in terms of age should be at least 21.However, the others suppose that this rule is completely based on the fallacious opinion. In this essay, I will cite some arguments and give my stance on this issue.
Firstly, the young who are going to marry should fathom the life painstakingly. Whilst the duration elapses the egregious plight and quandaries inculcate them to learn the new experiences in the mankind. For most people, in order to underpin this learning, the age limitation is one of the most paramount prerequisites. Because the person whose age is beneath 21 cannot adapt to the certain circumstances easily. Sometimes he will have to deal with tremendous problems and as an implication of it, he will abdicate his responsibilities. Subsequently, it can be rather perilous for his marriage in the future.
On the other hand, everything is contingent upon the person himself and if he is trustworthy, nothing can cease him from attaining the authentic pinnacle of his marriage. In such condition, the responsibility plays a major role. In spite of the age difference, at times younger people’s marriage becomes happier than those who are older. Because of it, they are so ebullient and their love is rather strong in order to struggle with the difficulties. As a result, these features bring to the stupendous fruition about their marriage.
Taking all things into account, it seems to me that the age is not a big problem for a happy marriage. The main issue is the dearth of love and responsibility that contribute to the augmenting divorce rate.
Essay 360:
It is true that competition is a significant attitude in a workplace which is more prevalence between young and old employees. There are numerous reasons regarding this issue and various measures can be taken by governments to improve this situation.
Higher unemployment proportion and the incursion of the innovative breakthrough are the major causes of increased competition amongst both young and old groups. Since people have faced economic recession in the world, the unemployment rate is rising they are more willing to maintain the job they have and youngsters compete with their  older counterparts to find a great job. At the same time, due to the advanced technology, employers find young generation more knowledgeable with higher qualifications. In this regard, youngsters are more likely to be recruited by them. However, the sense of competitiveness will arise at this point because older people believe that traditional and conventional methods are far more useful and never replaced with novel ones.
Providing greater job possibilities and utilising both young and old people to train each other are the keys to solving this problem. It is governments' responsibility to invest in creating job opportunities and employ or maintain the elderly who are skilled and experienced so as to train younger counterparts. Besides, authorities can offer training courses for old workers in order to boost their technological knowledge. As a result, older people can benefit from the younger to learn modern technology usage at work.
In conclusion, the competition among the young and the old workers will only be tackled if both groups help each other to improve their weaknesses and providing more job opportunities in the society.
Essay 362:
Some people believe that developed countries should permit qualified job seekers who are from developing and underdeveloped countries, however, some others argue that it does not necessarily have to impose that discretion. This is not a trivial question to answer. Personally, I agree that there should be such permission for finding jobs from wealthy regions for workers who are originally from poor regions based on national cooperation in encountering poverty and mutual advantages point of views.
To begin with, fighting poverty is an international responsibility, thus there should be some cooperative efforts between rich and poor regions. Since unemployment may be a major concern triggering poverty in destitute areas, one solution to overcome this problem is by creating a joint-partnership with rich countries that have to allow workers who meet the requirement of skills and knowledge to work. By applying this discretion, skilled employees from poor areas can be harnessed to run work effectively and they also may learn and gain experiences of how working in a progressive area and can bring back this experience to their origin for improvement.
Furthermore, employing required and talented people from deprived regions can contribute to a mutual advantage between prosperous and poor cities. For successful cities, this idea can help increase their regional income as knowledgeable human resources are available to operate their factory and other occupation. Meanwhile, for deprived cities, it will help coping with poverty because skilled citizens can elevate their earnings to accomplish better life ahead.
Nature of business and globalisation require rich nations to have talented individuals from different parts of the world to better understand the customer segments of other nations and to market their products and service properly. Organisation like Google, Microsoft and Samsung already have employees from different countries and other organisations in rich countries should follow this trend as well.  
All in all, employing skilled and qualified workers from poor regions may be a form of national understanding in tackling poverty as well as sharing mutual benefit between rich and poor countries. Life will have a balance when everything is adequate, is not it?
In today’s modern world, although there are a number of countries who have become rich and more affluent by following the development and advancement of technology, there are still some nations who have remained poor. Therefore, some people assert that rich countries have an obligation to offer jobs to talented and wise workers who come from the poor countries, which I strongly agree with.
There are several reasons which influence my view. To begin with, the act of allowing jobs for skilled and knowledgeable employees from poor countries by rich nations is considered to be an effective way to help the poor countries and it will indirectly strengthen the relationship among nations. It is important to ensure there will not be an occurrence of war between the nations which may have negative effects on the people’s lives, for example, it may even cost many innocent lives. By maintaining the close relationship between the countries by offering jobs for the employees from poor countries, the citizens in both nations can live in peace and serenity.
The following factor that supports the idea of offering jobs to employees from poor countries by rich nations is that it could prove useful in helping the poor countries, especially the third world countries to reduce the cases of poverty. By offering jobs to the citizens from poor nations, they are able to support their family financially when they get back to their home countries. As proverb said, kill two birds with one stone, this action is believed to be beneficial to both sides, not only it will help the poor countries to tackle poverty and starvation problems, but also will help the rich nations to continue to prosper and flourish in the decades to come. This is mainly due to the reason that the talented and intelligent employees from poor countries can contribute endlessly to the rich countries.
In conclusion, I strongly agree with the idea that rich countries should allow jobs for the employees from poor nations who are talented and intelligent owing to numerous factors. I believe the poor nations will soon become richer as long as the rich countries are willing to lend them a helping hand.
Essay 363:
Some people believe that developed countries should open migration and work opportunities for skilled and educated people from third world countries, while others disagree with this opinion. The following essay will discuss the statement in details before stating my own opinion and drawing a rational conclusion.
On the one hand, some experts think that developed countries should accept highly skilled people from underdeveloped countries. It is a fact that many developed countries such as Canada, Australia and New Zealand have a lacking of skilled workers and letting people come from underdeveloped countries to work in such countries would be beneficial for both parties. These developed countries have large natural resources but fewer population and hence they should welcome extra resources from other countries, especially poor countries who have a large population. Obviously, they need a lot of talented and educated people to boost their economic development, and one of the most effective ways is to open a migration path for skilled workers from third world countries.
On the other hand, it is true that many developed countries have opened their doors to skilled immigrants these days. This fact has a cause a serious problem for many poor countries. Many of their knowledgeable and skilled people have migrated to advanced countries since they would get higher salaries, better benefits and safer political condition. As a result, these countries face difficulties in improving their economic conditions as they lack educated and skilled people. From a different perspective, the open immigration and work opportunity often increases the terrorism in first world countries which are evident from the recent world events.       
In conclusion, to a certain point, I would agree with the migration policy of some rich countries which accept skilled people from developing countries. However, I also believe that the policy should also be limited to a certain quota, therefore not all of the best people from the poor countries leave their nations. It is obvious that the poor countries also need their best people to develop their countries.
Essay 365:
At recent years, most of the people started to know the cultures of other countries. It is caused by many aspects such as the ongoing growing in international travel and the continuous improvement of variation of media. Inevitably, I believe that this phenomenon is a positive development for several considerations given below.
To begin with, people in all parts of the world will easily get familiar with other countries' way of life. They will gain acknowledgements relating to the variety of cultures, common beliefs, kinds of religions, even mindsets so they can obtain more wisdom thinking not to judge others by wrong or right. Moreover, they will understand the geographical conditions and typical rules and laws which are applied as in depth processes of learning other civilisations so they attain a complete condition of surroundings in other parts of the world.
To end with, the economy impacts are also undeniable. The flights industry will thrive, the tourism places will be favourable; the providers of a tour guide will be profitable because people are eager to know more about other cultures by staying close to the original places. As the result, local communities will achieve more income as direct effect and will be aware of social-economy purposes as well as the need for educational capacities (for example, learning foreign languages, mastering calculations of revenues, etc.) as indirectly long term impacts. As consequences, the governments together with city councils should pay more attentions to regulate and stay focus to this economy sector.
To sum up, the advantages of knowing how other people live in other countries are inevitable so stakeholders are supposed to take responsibilities to maximise the result both social and economy benefits.
Essay 366:
Colour has always played an important role in the human history and according to some recent research, it affects our consciousness and mood. I personally believe that a proper colour represents a good will and shows tenderness and this is why public buildings should have proper colour and decoration.
To begin with, we are associated with different colours from the very beginning of our life. Parents and teachers teach us different colours and scientists believe that a child’s ability to classify different colours is connected with his calibre and talent. Thus our brains associate this colours with our moods and feelings. For instance, the red light on the streets sends an immediate alert to our brain to stop our vehicle while the green colour signals us to go ahead. Thus we are trained to react and feel differently with the association of colours. From this perspective, it is important to use soothing and accepted colours in places like schools, hospitals and offices.
Furthermore, we tend to associate colours with different events from our personal experience. For this reasons, some people relate red with blood while white with peace. Universally blue is the colour of nature and fewer people would complain about it. Besides, people in some countries relate colours with certain moods. For example, more than one quarter Americans believe that the blue has something to do with comfort and cosiness while red represents violence. Due to the influence of colours in human psychology, all renowned food and beverage retailers have their own colour schemes.
According to an article published on the Huffington Post, a combination of slate blue mixes with olive green and soft cream has helped to foster a team environment in many organisations. This also states that it has increased the team spirit and productivity of employees.
To conclude, people’s wellbeing often depends on psychological condition and since colour has an acute influence on our mood, proper colour schemes should be used in our homes, offices, schools and public places.
Essay 367:
Since the beginning of the civilisation, colour is a big part of human life. Different research and experiments have been done to find the effect of colours on people’s mood and psychology and the findings show that feelings of people can be influenced by colour. Hence, public buildings are suggested to use appropriate colour for decoration to motivate people to feel better. I agree that colour can affect our psychology and that is why offices and other public buildings should have appropriate colour and decorations.
Firstly, a public health service should be located at a nice place, have a comfortable environment and appropriate decoration so that people feel better being there. It is important for the patients who stay there for quite a while or visit there for treatments. The top priority should be the better treatment facility and skilled doctors and then the colour scheme and decoration should be set in a way so that people feel better being there. Green and white could be two suitable colours for a hospital. Colour of the building and decoration matter and that’s why the restaurants and food selling brands have invested a lot of money to find the right colour to inspire people to eat and drink. Almost every renowned restaurant has its own branding and colour to attract people.  Proper colour can keep people calm and help them feel better and that’s why it is especially important for the hospitals and other health care centres to have the right colour and decoration. From my experience, I can say that I can wait more time in a room with soothing colour and decoration than in a messy room with very bright colour.  A particular colour can trigger our brain and arouse our feelings unconsciously.
Similarly colour and interior decoration used in an office building can affect the mood and psychology of employees. Natural and eye-soothing colours are better for our physical and mental health and directly related to our stress level. Hence using the most appropriate colour in offices is also important. From my personal experience, I can say that I find light green, aqua and white colour very eye-soothing and I prefer to stay in a room decorated using these colours. Probably a very bright red colour would give me a headache as it is often related to anger, frustration and fire. Thus I believe that colours are directly and indirectly related to people’s work performance, mental state and health.
To conclude, I stand to claim that colour has a big effect on human psychology in many ways. Thus, colour or decoration of a room should never be selected randomly. Rather a good amount of time should be invested to colour any building.
Essay 369:
It is often stated that some people are born to be a leader. However, many people assume that a good leader may achieve leadership skill due to social interaction. Personally, I reckon to the second statement that to be a leader means to have the ability to understand some needs of the public and having proper behaviour and the leadership quality is achieved rather than to born with. 
To begin with, the leadership qualities may trigger when there are crisis or opportunities in a community or a particular place which allows individuals to step forward and take some responsibilities. These characteristics occur to respond the social requests for overcoming some obstacles in that place. For example, when there is an election in a region, some individuals can register to be a leader, however, the only way to ensure the real figure is by giving matters to solve which may prove their leadership ability. Therefore, people who gain some input from society may have better qualities than people who have less interaction ability.
Furthermore, it is believed that person in charge should respect one another. It means that they could manage and embrace people from various types. At the same time, the leader should treat others equally regardless their background and social status. Treating people equally might seem challenging in term of social satisfaction. However, if a leader can solve this issue, they will be known as a real leader.
Some people are born with leadership quality as per many people’s opinion. But I believe that leadership is a quality which is related to someone’s personality, social influence, motivation and ambition. It is not unusual that we have so many great leaders in our history who simply responded to the need of time and stepped forward to help others. Leadership is a quality we must learn and feel passionate about.
In conclusion, some qualities of leadership could not be achieved as a gift or destiny, yet it takes time and effort. Being friendly to society may become indispensable aspect to reach that goal since this opportunity provides people to engage deeply.
Essay 371:
Stylish and branded dresses have significant demand among people in all over the world. While it is highly desirable due to its charm, I believe that outfits should be selected according to one’s necessity and comfort instead of the modern trend.
From my point of view, there are few reasons for people to usually want to have new dresses even when they do not need them at all. One of the strong issues behind this is “impression”, which people think embarks by fancy dresses.  Sometimes it has considered as a first and foremost requirement to being up to date, confident and good looking. Apart from this, another indicator that insists people having stylish clothes is the fascination with their favourite celebrities and following their vogue blindly. Keeping up with the latest fashion and to be on trend are two factors people do to attract admirers in many cases. Undoubtedly, these are the factors that drive the world fashion industries and designer labels towards the supreme positions.
Despite those reasons, we must admit, a basic need of our life like “cloth” should be purchased more smartly and wisely. Excessive shopping of dresses should be avoided because there are also many productive ways in our life where investing this money and time seem more sensible. For an instance: by cutting the extra budget of useless clothes, one can easily raise a fund for the purpose of entertainment, own a business or can run any kind of charity organisation. Furthermore, one should care about his or her appearance and the particular ambience while selecting a dress. Because it is the real definition of smartness that grabs more attention than modernised open up outfits. Following trendy fashions often contradicts with someone’s native culture and that can lead to social problems. Have a sense of style does not mean that someone has to wear the expensive and latest dresses always.
In conclusion, while spending money, time and energy for having useless dresses just to show off and attract attentions, I believe utilisation of these elements in other creative areas and choosing comfortable clothes are far more reasonable.
Essay 373:
Caregivers share the common ground when it comes to childcare activities. In this regard, showing the correct ropes for a growing child to become a shining star in life has been a monopoly for years. Giving weekly pocket money for their wards seem to be a helpful method to make them grow as more competent individuals, according to some parents. While this practice is being beneficial to a certain extent, I also believe it has its own drawbacks.
Money given on a weekly basis to children could help them to become adept at financial management in future. This is because right from childhood they would know the value of money and what can be bought with how much cost. Besides, they would have also been exposed to situations wherein they have to save a fortnight’s money to get something essential. For example, a recent study on child’s attitude to finance, 2014, presents that, if Rs 50 is given per week to a child, the response would be planned expenditure in the fourth week in comparison with the first week. All in all, this change in perception of finance and its efficient planning would definitely help out in the future life of every child.
On the flipside, the penny allotted for children at an early age could deteriorate their lives. There are high probabilities that they may be misled due to their acquaintance. Take for an instance, a child whose essentials are taken care by parents and does not want to spend money on anything, a companion of the child, in particular at the adolescent stage, might make him indulge in some anti- social activities like smoking or drinking. Therefore, until a child gets matured to become aware of the ins and outs of life, even a single penny given would drift away him or her from the path of life.
In conclusion, though a grown-up man or woman takes some time to get on grips economically and attain a social status, it is all a part and parcel of life. In my opinion, the early stage of life, childhood should only be spent for having academic skills as well as pedagogic learning of basic expenses. But if the mother’s and father’s trust this method, the expenses are to be followed by them to borne fruitful results out of this.
Essay 374:
It is common that many parents today offer nominal sums of money to their children weekly. Some people assert that this method of financial gifting would develop certain independent skills required for children in the long run. I personally agree that this would make children more capable and skilled in money management as they grow older for various reasons but would possess some dangers that cannot be ignored.
To begin with, one of the major advantages of this practice is the accomplishment of the knowledge about money management in childhood. Moreover, it is a fact that childhood is the formative period of life. Therefore, if children are taught such skills, certainly that would strengthen their ability to confront with various skills and tribulations in the long run. Another merit of this act is that this money could be used for their personal needs especially in emergency situations. To cite an example, children can effectively manage incidences like the unexpected cancellation of the public transport and strikes and so on. Besides, the habit of saving can be cultivated and parents can keep them happy and satisfied and thereby strengthen the family bonds.
On the other hand, it can be noticed that children are just agile and fun-loving in nature, who are not always physically and mentally matured enough to take informed decisions about money. These youngsters, who are tender-minded, could use this money for various purposes such as smoking, drug addiction and for amazing latest trendy gadgets. The result would be even more disastrous as it would surge the number of crimes in the society. To cite an example, many evil minded people could take it as a source of revenue by cheating and harming the vulnerable children for the money.
Nowadays, a growing number of people encourage parents to grant a small amount of pocket money weekly to their children. This is because they believe that giving weekly money to young children would enhance their financial management skills in future. However, some childcare organisations and guardians ask parents to avoid giving money to their juvenile. They claim that handing over money to their adolescents in early age might have deleterious impacts. However, I strongly assert that children have the right to receive a lump sum amount of money weekly so that they can readily fulfil their personal necessities and can learn better money management from an early stage of their life.  
Firstly, it is intuitively obvious that teenagers who receive weekly pocket money from their parents can become experts in finance management in the future life. Additionally, they involve practically in financial matters and since they have limited amount they persist and strive in order to accomplish all their necessities without crossing financial boundaries. Alternatively, granting money to offspring on a weekly basis have other uncountable benefits such as they become familiar with the methodology of bargaining. Moreover, children who want to buy a specific toy or gadget for themselves start accumulating money in their fantastic treasure boxes. As a result, they can primarily go through the sophisticated process of saving money. Ultimately, it is extremely fundamental for parents to allocate a small budget weekly for their children because children's necessities are as mandatory as elder's. On top of this, the biggest demerit of not delivering pocket money to children is that they become a victim of inferiority complexity. Last but not the least, they often create social distances from their friends and family members.
On the contrary, it is undoubtedly acknowledged that children who start possessing money in their younger ages can instantly involve in illegal activities and bad habits. For instance, drinking alcoholic beverages, taking drugs and smoking require money and children who have money can incline to these bad habits. There are ample evidence to suggest that children who receive extra cash for their necessities are highly likely to commit crimes and get involved in bad habits.  
In conclusion, although offspring who do not grab a single penny from their parents are somewhat protected from getting into bad habits like smoking and alcoholic addictions, but in my opinion, parents should provide freedom to their kids in terms of purchasing their favourite and desired products and gadgets. As a result, they would probably become experts in purchasing, financial management, saving as well as bargaining.
Essay 375:
Many people think that giving some money to children on a weekly basis will assist them in becoming more capable when they grow older. I personally disagree with the statement and the following essay will discuss some of my reasons for disagreement.  
Firstly, by giving a small amount of money to children regularly we are not teaching them about being independent. It is a fact that children are learning many things from their parents in the early age and parents must do their best in becoming a good role model for them. By giving money to children routinely, these parents are teaching their children that they do not have to work hard or do something important to earn money. They will learn that someone will give them some money every week which they could spend on. For example, I can recall some of my cousins who regularly get a good amount of money from their parents and yet they have not build up any habit of being independent or any sense of saving money for the rainy days.      
 Secondly, the money could be misused by the children as they could spend it for buying inappropriate stuff. It is undeniable that children are not yet mature and do not have the wisdom in managing their own money. They might purchase things which might be inappropriate for them, especially in third world countries where children are allowed to buy cigarettes or alcoholic beverages. Many teenagers, for example, get money from their parents and spend those for buying drugs or cigarettes which eventually harm their future rather than making any good.      
In conclusion, some people believe giving children a small amount of money each week would help them in becoming more capable when they become adults. I do not agree with the statement as I believe that it could spoil them and the money could be misused. I agree if parents would teach children to earn some money by having a part-time job during the summer holiday, therefore they will appreciate their income and spend it wisely.
Essay 377:
Our mother earth is weeping because of the two major threats, pollution and climate change. In spite of many global conferences being held to find out a permanent solution, a promising remedy is yet to be put into action. This essay will shed some light on the need to look for an effective plan and the alternatives that could put an end to these ever growing issues in the near future.
There are several reasons to support the ineffectiveness of the solutions provided. Firstly, the more pragmatic the solution is the more it would be implemented and many decisions which are taken so far to combat the climate changes are less pragmatic. Take for an instance, putting up the usage of private vehicles tends to be something that can only exist on black and white. Secondly, measures taken so far seem like would be effective only in a long run. As a result, we still suffer the consequences of poor air quality, global warming and unpredictable climate. Finally, if only the rules enforced are stringent, is there a possibility for it to be implemented. The figures of authorities are usually less careful about the long-term effects of these global concerns on the future generation. Mitigation! That is what the world needs. The world leaders take decisions to fight the pollutions and climate change and many of these decisions remain in the papers and never see the daylight. The ideas should be implemented not discussed. The lack of implementation and budget are two main reasons we still have the pollution and increased Earth temperature.
However, there are possibilities to make this planet clean and habitable again. For this to happen, sharing of vehicles among commuters of same destination or a reliable public transportation could be introduced. Besides, instead of focusing on long-term actions like reducing deforestation done for residential purposes, plantation of a large number of saplings and creation of awareness programmes for students would be much more operative. Furthermore, a hefty fine for non-environmental friendly activities ought to be followed to make the solutions efficient. The world leaders have to make things happen rather than discussion and decisions. They should enforce every country to implement the measures they think useful. Funnily, they decide to reduce the number of private vehicles on the roads and yet their countries produce millions of cars to export to other countries and they are investing more on space research than to make the world livable. That’s something that should be taken seriously not lightly.
To bring the curtains down, the whys and wherefores of dissolutions that didn’t bear fruits were put in the limelight and also the immediate changes that can be done to hand down the globe as it is to the posterity were suggested.
It is undeniable that environmental issues such as global warming and pollution have negative impacts on all countries and these negative consequences would affect the whole world. Even though some global solutions have been addressed to solve these problems, many people believe that they were not effective and efficient. The following essay will discuss some of the reasons why the solutions were not successful and how these issues should be resolved.
For a number of reasons, solutions that have been implemented for resolving environmental issues were considered as ineffective. Firstly, solutions were only implemented by certain countries. For example, only a few countries in the world implement carbon monoxide test for vehicles such as Canada or Australia while it should have been done in all countries. Other countries such as India and China are allowing vehicles with all conditions to commute in their streets and roads. Secondly, some countries do not provide clear regulations and laws regarding to environmental issues. For instance, in several countries, there is no fine or penalty when people throw the garbage to the river or sea. As a consequence, oceans are still polluted with waste from these countries. Though many global policies have been taken, many of them are not implemented in many countries. This is the main reason we still have increasing world temperature and pollutions.
There are some solutions that the United Nations and governments could consider to resolve these environmental issues. One of the solutions is that it must be agreed and implemented by all countries. For example, Air Conditioners and Refrigerators must not use CFC gas which is dangerous for the ozone layers. These regulations must be implemented internationally, and for countries that still use CFC must be banned and given penalties. And then, each country should have strict regulations regarding to environmental issues and the United Nations should audit each of these countries on a timely manner. By having a review from an independent party, each country is forced to implement friendly environmental practices in their area.
Essay 378:
It is sometimes argued that more money should be spent on preventive measures than treatments, as they are of greater importance. However, I would argue that cure and prevention are equally important when it comes to spending money in these areas.
There are several reasons why it can be argued that government should spend money on tackling the causes of diseases. Cost-effectiveness is the key element when placing more importance on these initiatives. By allowing people to have access to these health monitoring strategies, governments can avoid the hefty priced hospitalised treatments or other extravagantly expensive medicines. Take the modified gene coding as an example, the technique of relocating genes in the DNA of human beings can help deliberately avoiding inherited lethal illnesses in newborns such as diabetes. In this way, not only the financial pressure on health care departments can be reduced, but also the painful suffering caused by these contagious sicknesses. Hence, an improved quality of life for those who take these measures is a better alternative. So, if government prioritises preventative approaches as a mandatory element in tackling health problems, people would surely be leading healthy lives in a near future.
I also believe that spending on treatments or medicines has of proportionately equal importance as of managing causes. Some diseases are too fatal that cannot be left without an intensive, holistic and advanced treatment. For instance, carcinogenic patients would have never been recovered with ever greater speed today, if huge state budget were not invested to produce chemotherapy. Similarly, without enough government funds for the best possible treatments to vulnerable patients, people' life expectancy will be affected devastatingly. So both these departments should be given equal money to keep them going.
In conclusion, governments have to make health reforms properly by investing equally in the cure and prevention of epidemic health illnesses in order to have better outcomes from health deprived people as well as ensuring a healthy and energetic living for them.
Essay 380:
It is often argued that people should be charged in accordance with the amount of pollution they produce. While I accept that certain organisations should be penalised for this, I believe that every individual should not be forced to pay a fine.
There are several reasons why the giant entrepreneurs should pay for contaminating the land. Having penalised with a specific amount of money factories will help the government to raise money which can be used in a variety of long-term and rationalised measures to mitigate the pollution from the earth. This will also deter them from producing more garbage and pollution. Take London as an example, where governments have invested recently a hefty amount of money in public transportation, in particular, local buses which have been designed to be much more efficient than the older ones. So these vehicles discharge fewer combustible pollutants into the air. Also, these self-centered companies sometimes exploit natural resources such as forests, water land and agricultural lands, beyond all their limits just to increase the profit. If these companies are not obliged to share the amount of money, which is required to curb pollutions, they will become more short-sighted (or greedy) in terms of making more money without even caring about the impact on climate change and environment.
However, I would argue that every individual should not be liable to pay recommended fine. It is unrealistic that we can stop people from polluting the universe merely by imposing charges. Because people need electricity to enjoy technologies, a farmland to grow crops and an accommodation to live, food to eat as well as a mean of transportation to travel. Furthermore, if people from devastated backgrounds are charged more for the impact they have on climate; it will create an upheaval situation where lower-income groups would not be able to pay even for their daily necessities.
In conclusion, organisations who are earning millions of pounds by exploiting natural resources should only be obliged to share the amount of money in curbing the pollution rather than all the common citizens.
Essay 382:
People all around the world take into account the significance of genetic engineering. Although it is sometimes thought that it has numerous benefits to humanity, others are of the opinion that it could bring destruction to the ecosystem. However, my opinion on that issue is that both negative and positive effects of genetic engineering should be carefully researched and then should be used for the greater good of humanity.
There are certain factors of the genetically engineering products. Firstly, crop modification will bring resistant to various plant diseases and it also targets infestation of unwanted insects. In other words, the amount of pesticides and fertiliser used are reduced. Furthermore, many countries are producing genetically engineered crops to produce a good variety of plants and abundant harvest. Genetic engineering can also address the increased food demands of people around the globe. Many diseases that human genetically inherits can be fought against with the improvement of genetic engineering and it can also ensure a generation.   
However, some people argue that it brings long-term effects to humanity and environment. Certain reasons for these are the concerns of human health in which most modified foods contain toxins that are harmful to us. Also, it produces a minimal amount of nutrition. Another major concern is the potential harm to the environment- once genetically modified organisms are released into the wild, it interbreeds with the native organism and creates new species that may not be desirable.
Finally, in my view, it is essential to look at the positive side it brings to humanity. As the population grows, the demand for food supply is increasing, thus, the natural method cannot cope the demand of the people. In this way, scientific way of plantation and farming are fundamental in our environment. Many diseases that cause death to a large number of people could be prevented using the blessing of genetic engineering.
In conclusion, there are good arguments for and against genetic engineering, so people must continue to research various methods to minimise the negative side effects of engineering products to ensure the betterment of every individual in the future.
Essay 384:
A museum is an entity that preserves the artifacts of history and works as an important representative of a nation’s tradition and culture. Thus the importance of museums to convey the historical facts to the new generation is beyond controversy. However, there are scopes to discuss whether entry to a museum should be free or not. I personally believe that there should be no charge for the museum entry as charging people for that have more demerits.
To begin with, ticket money for museum entrance discourages many students and low-income families to visit them. The collection of large museums increases day by day and thus people need to visit museums on a regular basis, not just once in a lifetime. When people need to spend money to witness history, many of them prefer going to movies instead. Furthermore, museums are mostly run by state funds and like public parks, sea beaches and libraries, they should be free of cost. The main reason museums get public funds is to convey the national history to the young people and to act as a national pride, not to earn from ticket money. From this regards, charging people for visiting museums have far more demerits than an ignorable advantage it offers.
Proponents of museum entrance fee believe that the ticket money is necessary for its maintenance while they fail to realise that this cost could easily be covered by the tax payers’ money. Charging these people and their children again is unrealistic. Finally, free entry to the museum would attract more international visitors and spread the cultural uniqueness to the world and thus bring more tourists to a country. If there are charges, tourists would visit more popular places than the museums.
Nowadays, many tourist attractions are present globally which are offered and promoted by the government and one of them is the museum. Museums also preserve and represent the history, traditions and many other important aspects of a country. In some museums, there is a policy that the visitors have to pay money before entering while others are free to visit. I certainly believe that the applied policy i.e. charging visitors for museum entrance derives more benefits than drawbacks.
First and foremost, money collected from the visitors can be utilised to maintain and develop the museum. For instance, it can be used to cover the utility bills, repairing costs, renovation and staff costs. Maintaining a large museum costs a huge amount of money and the revenue earned from the visitors could be a good source of money to do that. Not all museums are funded by the government and sometimes museum‘s fund is not enough to cover all the costs it requires. If no money is taken from visitors, such museums would have to be shut down.  So admission fee in museums seems very utilitarian to maintain a better museum.
Furthermore, due to applied tariff, inhabitants who enter a place providing scientific or historical values are likely to spend their leisure time there and do not enter unnecessarily. For example my sister, Lia tends to read carefully the available information provided in the museum and one of the reasons she does that because she wants to get some value from the money she spent. This example makes clear that admission money is seemly very utilitarian to encourage and educate the visitors to use facilities offered maximally.
On the other hand, entrance fee in museums possibly reduce the guests because most of the people prefer to come to places and spend idle time that can be entered without any money. To illustrate, a garden located in the city gets more visitors than the other amusement parks which require a ticket to enter. The people in the garden go to walk, gossip and to chat with others which should not be the case in a museum. Only interested and real visitors in a museum would make it a better place for people to learn and visit.
To conclude, although admission charge will attract fewer visitors in a museum in many cases, considering the purpose of a nice museum and to cover the expenses it requires, the entry fees seem to have more advantages than the drawbacks. 
Essay 386:
Whether university students should study subjects of their own choices or should they be obliged to study career oriented technology and science major subjects is a widely debated issue. Both of these views have arguments for and against them and this essay delves these views and expresses my opinion before drawing a reasonable conclusion.
On the one hand, a university is the highest citadel for education in a country and it is considered that it builds the next adept generation who would lead the country. From this regards, the education and teaching policy of the university affect the whole nation. Some experts are in the opinion that students at university level should be given a certain freedom while picking majors they study in and there should not be any predefined syllabus. They opine that forcing them to study some latest subjects for the future employment would make them become workers for offices, not leaders for the country. They also express that letting them study a wide range of subjects would make them far more knowledgeable and prepared to take challenges and this policy would inspire tertiary level students to follow their dream and not just blindly run for their career. Furthermore, society needs as many artists as there are as many scientists. Forcing university students to study only science and teach related subjects would create an imbalance in our society.  
On the contrary, the university authority must consider the consequences of letting students choose their subjects. A recent study shows that predefined syllabus-bound a student study regularly and prepares for the exam while freedom to take any subject dramatically increases the number of dropout students. This is an alarming issue and this is why the university authority needs to think twice before implementing the policy. Furthermore, development of a nation, these days, highly depends on the technologically sound workforce and universities should yield such workforce for the country. From this perspective, it seems quite logical for universities to teach science related subjects to most of its students.           
To conclude, universities have to consider the pros and cons of any policy adopted including whether the students are free to pick their subjects or not. Personally, I believe that letting university students prefer their subjects have far more benefits and seem more logical in a broader sense.
Essay 387:
University students are going to lead different important sectors in few years and hence their education is one of the most important aspects of a country. It is often debated how much freedom they should be given while choosing the subjects and I personally believe that they should have the freedom to pick subjects within a prescribed syllabus, not whatever they like.
To begin with, the freedom of selecting subjects in university level would make the education more effective and would not force students study subjects that they have no interest at all. Though technology related subjects are quite important, students would not learn that much if he is forced to learn programming while his interest is in literature. Thus a student should be given the freedom to pick the subjects he likes, especially for the university students. For instance, many arts faculties in western universities offer students to pick technology related subjects while the reverse is also true.
However, an absolute freedom to pick subjects for the university students is not a good idea as well. This will often lead to situations when students will not have sufficient knowledge on some aspects that are crucial for the career. Some students would misuse this facility and pick the same subjects in different semesters. It will also lead to a haphazard situation as most of the students would like to study the same subjects and the university authority would not be able to offer these courses to all.
To conclude, a certain freedom while picking subjects in university level is very helpful for the overall development and knowledge enhancement of students. However, an absolute freedom would make the outcome worse.
Essay 388:
Nowadays, it is obviously seen that majority of people tend to carry on their higher education in institutions such as a university or a college. While some citizens believe that students should have their freedom to study subjects that they are interested in while others disagree with it and opine that they have to be involved in major that will be very utilitarian in the future.
At the beginning, every person in this world is likely to have human rights, which means they are free to follow something that they like, choosing a subject at the university as an example. Generally, students have a tendency to join the major that rely on their passions. To illustrate, my brother, Luce, he has an interest in analysing data and he has decided to go into Statistics and the committee of a university cannot restrict him to study that subject since that action seems restricting someone from his interest. Thus once a student gets admitted to a university or a college, s/he should have the freedom to read the subjects that interest him/ her. Studying from passion is more effective in most of the cases.
On the other hand, many people feel that students should join in a major, particularly which is related to technology and science, such as natural science and technology, information technology etc. and they should solely focus on studying these subjects. Based on research carried out by Statistics Center in Semarang, it is predicted that due to globalisation, the world will be focused on technology and science in the future. So, it is certainly believed that college students should be involved in correlating with those subjects so that they can adapt to the future circumstances and develop themselves.
After hashing out both points of views, it can be concluded that although people certainly have a freedom to choose their major in university and colleges, it is a wise decision to study subjects that can be utilised in their future.
Essay 389:
Different people have different opinions about the usage of one of the most commonly used fidgeting gadgets -mobile phones in public places. While I believe that the rule of restricting its usage could be beneficial to a certain extent, I also put forth that it would create some negative consequences to the regular users and in people's emergencies as this rule would become a scrutiny.
There are several arguments to support this restriction: First, had the mobile phones been let free in public places like libraries, there  would be a higher probability for the other people to get distracted. This distraction could completely spoil the reading environment for which they are meant for. Secondly, if there is a ban on the usage of mobile phones in railway stations, is there a possibility for the work to progress without any disruption or stagnation. Take for an instance, passengers who are supposed to buy tickets or the issuing authorities have a conversation over their mobile phones while they are supposed to do their duties, there happens a delay in the workflow for no important reason. Though the ban imposed could bring benefits, it is the need of the hour to analyse the drawbacks of it.
People who oppose the restriction of this rule state that a few negative sides are in the limelight. According to their view, the more they use the mobile phones, the more they will be connected with their circle- be it their family, colleagues or friends. Due to the restriction placed on, they might not find time to catch up with their dear ones’ and this  would be more appropriate for the commuters who  use mobile phones while commuting. Besides this, in cases of emergencies wherein a person has to pick up the call in public places, this rule would be an obstruction. As a result, the information which has to be conveyed to them could be delayed and this may make a great difference in their lives.
By and large, the restriction of mobile phones in public places has its own fair share of advantages and disadvantages. Therefore, in my opinion, wherever we use a mobile phone, we should make sure that no person or work is disturbed because of our cell phone usage. It is also suggested that every person should think by instinct and use mobile phones as and when it is required.
Essay 390:
Innovative and latest technology such as internet and computer have an intense effect on the people, especially in their workplaces. As a result, the method of working is transforming continuously. These days, technology has epidemically flared and even overtaking the humans, who are the inventors of the technology. I personally believe that there are more pitfalls on relying technology than the advantages it offers.
Technology made us work less and move even least. We rely on computer and the internet to have our work done. The faster communication has made the global business a reality, though not without a cost.
No doubt, technology has negative impacts on the human. Firstly, technology had made people extremely sponger. For instance, people used to travel on foot to in the past especially, in India. As a consequence people remained active and fit and also free from ample of ailments namely fatigue, heart disease and severe disease like cancer as well. Their average life expectancy was far more than the generation we see now. Though it is claimed that technological advancement has enhanced people’s lifespan and cured many diseases, I do not see that it is true. When it was common for people to live more than 100 years in the past, many people nowadays dies at their early 60s.
Moreover, technology has a greater impact on the young generation. Most of the students and children even cannot do brainstorming in time base task. In addition to this, scholars and children, are losing their own personal skills, this is all because they are not using their own knowledge and creativity. As an example, most of the students are using Wikipedia and imitating the same text in their projects or assignment which is an abominable way to pass the exam. The way people are becoming dependent on technology, a simple mistake on a calculation or a wrong decision taken by a computer device will create a disaster. Consider the nuclear research centre where everything is computerised. If a computer virus attacks this station or a hacker hack this station, this could lead to a global catastrophe.  
Our relationship with each other has seriously been affected due to the modern technology like smartphones, computers and social networking websites. People no longer interact each other in person so intimacy among them is plunging day by day. To illustrate, webcams and the internet are the predominant reasons behind this. Technology has reached to the institution where students get best study (smart classes) hence communications among students and tutors are dropping.
Essay 391:
It is true that children face a lot of challenges in their schools these days to give complete focus on academics due to various reasons. Even though there are many causative factors, parents and teachers can take several steps to mitigate these issues.
There are many reasons behind the lack of concentration among school children in classrooms. First and foremost, unlike the past, today the number of broken and single-parent families is increasing. Children from such families cannot focus completely on their studies as they are not mentally healthy and happy. For example, in India, a recent survey report showed that failure rate is much higher among children who come from problematic families than the other children. Next, nutritional status is another important fact. Since pupils have more things to study, they often skip breakfast to save time. As a result, they become fatigued and weak easily when they reach schools and it affects negatively in their academic performance. Other important reasons for the lack of attention among children in schools are increasing air and noise pollutions, unhealthy diets, addition to computer games and insufficient parenting.
However, there are several ways to tackle these problems effectively. I believe the most obvious solution is that parents should maintain a healthy and comfortable environment at home, which provides mental pleasure and energy to children for performing in school appropriately. Besides, they will be happy instead of unreasonable mental agony and psychological depression. Consequently, they can achieve higher grade or score in examinations. A further step would be to encourage nutritional intake of children by parents and teachers. Parents should prepare a balanced diet for students and moreover, they should promote and cultivate nutritional healthier habits. Next, nutritional classes should be organised in school premises to increase the awareness among pupils. The teacher should make sure that the classes are interesting and children’s can enjoy them. It is natural that when a classroom does not grab the attention of children, they will feel disconnected and bored. Enough emphasis should be put on making lessons suitable for children. Parents should make sure a healthy lifestyle and balanced diet for their school going children.  
Essay 392:
These days many people chose to live alone, especially in metropolitan areas and this rate is far higher in developed countries and seems like this has become quite normal there. I believe this trend has more negative consequences than the few positive outcomes it offers.
The single-person family is seen to be positive from better personal skill development and economic perspective. A single-member family forces a person to learn some basic skills including cooking, cleaning the house, paying the utility bills, managing personal finance, purchasing daily commodities, adopting hobbies and many more important skills. This makes someone self-dependent which has a greater impact on the development of the country in a broader sense. For instance, research shows that students who stay away from home for their tertiary degrees learn more skills and become more self-dependent than pupils who study from home. Moreover, a single-person family member is bound to do a job, business or have some sort of arrangement for a steady earning and this trend has a great positive impact on a country’s economy.     
From the opposite viewpoint, the trend of increasing single-person family has many negative consequences. Firstly, the increasing trend of living alone has a direct relationship on the percentage of people suffer from psychological problems these days. Living alone creates loneliness and depression, unlike the traditional family where there are always others to share someone’s distress and sadness. The isolation often leads people to choose a lifestyle that is often negative. A recent study reveals that single-person family members often rely on drugs and many of them become addicted. The human is a social being and living alone is against their natural tendency. For many, bearing the total expenses is tough and this leads them to get involved in crimes.
In the recent years, most people, particularly in developed countries, likely to opt for living independently. Although living solo come along with several drawbacks, I would consider this more of a positive development.
For several reasons, living alone may have some drawbacks. Firstly, living independently can be extremely costly as life is becoming increasingly complex and property price is just skyrocketing. This has created a difficult situation in finding an accommodation at a reasonable price. For this reason, single occupants may have to work unbelievably hard to make their ends meet. Being a singleton has meant that they cannot expect any financial or moral support from family or relatives in most cases. Lone occupants are more likely to experience depression, anxiety and uncertainty with bearing all household responsibilities on top of pursuing a work life than family-oriented people. As a result, single people tend to lead a hectic as well as burdensome life with having a feeling of being resented and anguished and therefore resulting an unhealthy lifestyle.
On the other hand, I believe that people, leading a life as single dwellers are the luckiest one. A sense of freedom with an acute privacy is something considered as the most desirable element of a happy life. This is the main reason why single occupant tends to be seen as a successful peer of the society. Because living a life on their own allows them to invest a precious time in the development growth and shaping out their personality. Furthermore, single people are likely to attend more public social affairs, thus allowing cities and urban areas to reinvigorate as they spend more money on holiday-making, doing outdoor activities or surfing other services compared to their couple counterparts. Finally, if more people became independent, the more they live greener by living in apartments or near to towns instead of living in suburb houses and commuting to work from far away stretched distances.
Essay 393:
How much freedom a child should be given and what sort of punishment could be used to control them is a matter of great concern. Undeniably, too much freedom and lack of necessary control often lead youngsters to go astray while too much punishment makes them dull and less creative. I personally believe that punishment is meant to help children learn lessons and that is why certain punishments that do not involve beating the children is useful.
To begin with, early childhood experience and lessons have lasting impacts on someone’s life and that is why parents and teachers should try their best to teach morality and good qualities to children. Children are curious and sometimes less mature to understand certain harmful effects of doing something while every father and mother want the offspring to become an ideal and exemplary person in life. They often need to use certain punishment to teach a valuable lesson to a youngster and the sole purpose of this punishment should be teaching a morality, should not be driven by any sort of personal anger or frustration. Physically beating a boy or a girl is in no way should be used as there are far better ways of punishing a child to teach him something.
While physical punishment is no longer used in most of the developed countries, it could still be found in underdeveloped countries. This form of punishment, in my opinion, should not be used. More effective penalties could be not talking to the child for a misconduct or not taking him to the playground for a day or two. Similarly, parents could refrain from awarding the child with chocolate or toys and reminding the child why he does not deserve those. If parents have a friendly relationship with the children and simply expressing their frustration for an act of the child, that would work like the magic. From my personal experience, I can say that I took matters more seriously when my father stopped talking to me for a certain period for something he disliked about me and I vowed many times to myself not to do that again.
To conclude, punishment is necessary to teach children morality and help them learn to distinguish good things from bad ones. However, this punishment should not be physical, rather psychological and practical.
Essay 394:
Education is likely to be the most important thing to be learnt by every child and that education is not restricted in academic lessons only but also in behaviour field as well. Most people think that young children should be taught about attitude at an early age and a punishment is required in some cases to complete this education. I certainly believe that some punishment for the betterment of the children should be allowed which I will brief in the following paragraphs.
First and foremost, it seems that teaching good behaviour and virtues, when children are still in young ages, will be easier both by parents and teachers. Moreover, if this lesson is followed by an appropriate penalty, they will fear and think twice before breaking the applied rules. Research carried out by Statistics Center in Semarang shows that the plenty of youngsters are easier to have a good manner if they got this lesson before they reach their maturity. In addition, if the youngsters know that they will be rebuked and punished if they commit bad actions, they will usually stay away from committing mischievous acts. This research makes clear that a lesson followed by convenience punishments at an early age is likely to be a wise idea to create the youngest being a good member of the society.
However, the punishment should always bet to teach a lesson not to intimidate a child. The teachers and parents should always think about alternative ways before imposing any punishment to a child. If the child commits the same abominable act several times, then a minor punishment to teach a lesson should be given. A severe punishment by a teacher or parents could psychologically damage a child and the teachers and parents should always be careful about their way of punishment. Sometimes taking away a favourite toy from a child can be an effective punishment where no physical punishment is required.  The teacher and parents should keep in mind that the main purpose of the punishment if to teach the child a lesson not to hurt him physically.
Children are at such age of their life when they merely distinguish between the right and the wrong. It is very necessary for parents and teachers to teach them the same, first, by suggestion or advice followed by punishment as many times their inexperienced mind tempt them to do mistakes. Punishment should not affect a child negatively; rather it must be constructive for them.
Nowadays children are most vulnerable to get affected by surroundings and electronic media as they easily get exposed to such media. It is impossible to protect them getting exposed to the external environment. Hence it is mandatory for parents or teachers to make them aware of morality and injustice at this age and sometimes punishment is necessary to protect them. At an early age, a child possesses boundless curiosity as he is just exposed to an outside world or society. Thus they imitate what they see and that turns out to be disastrous at times. To avoid that minor punishment is the best way as fear of punishment makes them stay away from many wrong doings. To prove that, the Stanford University had done many surveys on children and the results show that 80% children who had already been punished for their particular mistakes had not repeated the same, on a flip side only 40% who are just advised.
On the other hand, punishments should always be associated with some lessons for children. Punishment must be fruitful and it must not be physically or mentally harmful. For example, world's nursery in Japan asks children to plant trees as a punishment. Many schools in India punish children by asking them to run few kilometres. Such punishments are constructive for children's health and society as well.
To conclude, I believe that children have to learn about positives and negatives at this age and punishment is one of the effective ways to guide them learn this distinction. However, parents and teachers must use constructive and positive punishments to show them the right path.
Essay 396:
Nowadays, many children spend a considerable amount of their time by playing computer games. While most of the people, especially parents, think that this is a waste of valuable time and this time should be utilised for learning academic lessons or taking part in outdoor activities, very few think playing computer games is helpful for children’s cognitive development. I firmly believe that children should play computer games particularly brain games and strategy games but a balance should be maintained so that it does not become an addiction.
In the highly developed technological modern world, it is important for children to play computer games. Firstly, by doing this they can learn how to use computers and become familiar with new technology. Moreover, children communicate to each other at school during the break and often discuss different strategies of some particular computer game. Not only do they develop their skills and knowledge such as 3D vision, imagination, and fantasy by playing those, but also computer game is the new modern way of leisure activity for young people, which help them develop thinking patterns, have friends online and build an online world. Many computer games are great learning resources and therefore parents and teacher should supervise what type of games a child play and how much time they spend on that.
On the other hand, spending too much time on computer games might be dangerous for children. For example, some children may not do their homework because they become addicted to computer games and play those most of the time. Also, children have less face-to-face communication with their friends and families as they are busy with games. Furthermore, some of youngest might even become aggressive as computer games expose them to violence and fighting. Therefore, the assistance from adults is needed to help children to keep a balance between computer games and other compulsory deals. Spending too much time can be detrimental to the children’s health, especially for their eyes.
To conclude, a balance is required to ensure children are not playing computer games too much and spending a lot of time in front of computers may lead to disadvantages in other arrears of life such as social communications. However, playing computer games for learning and exploring new ideas can be a very effective way to enhance knowledge and imagination for children.
Essay 398:
It is true that homework is an essential part of education for school children. Some of them think that homework helps them enormously, whereas others are of the opinion that it has very little value for students. Even though it brings some disadvantages, such activities are often considered to be advantageous due to various reasons.
People who argue that homework is very useful among school children consider many important factors. First and foremost, since homework is the important part of education in younger classes, it will cultivate a regular study habit in them considerably. To make it clear, pupils are forced to learn lessons whatever they studied in their classroom every day and they never forget such things in the long run. Moreover, they can achieve higher score or grade in their final examination. To explain, if they do homework on a daily basis, obviously doubts can easily be clarified and it would help to understand each and every aspect. Naturally, students can face examinations without much preparation as well as without any fear.
Furthermore, free time can be utilised efficiently instead of playing games. It also gives insight among students about the serious aspect of education in life. As a result, they develop a sense of responsibility and time management skills from the tender age onwards. Consequently, it would lead to the development of productive citizens.
However, there are others who contend that homework causes detrimental effects on children. This reduces leisure time of children to a great extent. Such imposed study exercises may create a negative attitude in children. Besides, some of them have a tendency to copy from other children as they are not capable themselves and they want to impress teachers as well. Nevertheless, I am strongly inclined to favour the idea the former statement because of the immense benefits.
Essay 400:
It is widely believed that grown-up children should be granted to take some particular responsibilities for making their own decisions at the age of sixteen.  I am on the belief that parents still have authorities on guiding their children at that time as long as it is not too much intervening. I will outline two measures that can be done by parents for guiding their children.
First of all, the most important area is safety. Children tend to do something based on what they like but careless on its risks. Likewise, children are more curious than adults that they want to try anything. For instance, in some developing countries like Indonesia, especially in a village, many adolescents ride a motorcycle before they are 15 years old and they do not require a driving license. Commonly, they drive fast and do not wear a helmet. This issue needs parents’ attention. Therefore, parents should give advice and necessary information about the suitable time for them for riding a vehicle.
Another measure is financial management. In some regions, most teenagers depend on their parents for money. It is my firm belief that guiding them on how to manage money from the young age will be valuable for their future. In addition, children could make a better decision on what their money should be spent on. For example, parents should give a particular amount of money regularly. They have to commit that there will be no extra funding even though it is hard up. Therefore, children’s awareness will go up and the probability of getting a part-time job is highly likely to happen. 
Proper guidance from parents can build a better future for the children. Teenagers often lack the experience for taking important decisions and the parents should always be friendly and supportive while guiding their children.
In short, whilst young people are granted particular privileges at a certain age, parents still have authorities for controlling them but without too much intervening. Children still need guidance for their future wellbeing.
Essay 402:
Usages and influence of media in our life and society have dramatically increased around the globe over the last few years. It has become a mandatory part of people’s lives as media are everywhere. Youngsters are mostly influenced by media because of its numerous benefits. People of other age groups are also influenced by the media. They are using this in the form of newspapers, television, radio and internet to avail maximum advantages such as information dissemination, entertainment and latest updates of various promotions etc. However, the increasing use of media has some detrimental effects on the society.
There is no doubt that media play a pivotal role in learning. A large number of people are using electronic media to complete their education assignment and projects, for instance, YouTube has a large volume of lectures in the form of videos to assist thousands of viewers. Moreover, media has a diversity of programs to entertain its target audience. It also helps them to increase their knowledge about current issues worldwide. Media often increase our awareness and inform about things that are happening around us. Thus it is a great tool to bring people together.  
However, media has also increased people’s woes. In order to increase rating, they are more opted to portray negative news and bad aspects of society that made people tense and increased their worries. Furthermore, people are less perceptive to physical activities because they do not want to skip their favourite television show and thus they become lethargic that makes them susceptible to illness such as laziness, obesity and anxiety. Political biasness, monetary gaining and vengeance are often practices in some media and that has very detrimental effects on our society.
To sum up, I would like to say media has more advantages that outweigh its disadvantages. Media make people independent and give them freedom to raise their voice against corrupt perpetrator residing in government and private institutions. However, students are more diverted to other issues highlighted by media than their focal point, which is education.
Essay 403:
Being a member of the contemporary world, it is everyone’s right to spend their personal and private life according to their own will. Media has great influence on celebrities’ lives and often highlights their private matters, which is considered to be a shameful tactic and they mainly do to get higher publicity and ratings for their television and newspapers etc. Some people claim that famous stars compromise with the fact that disclosing and revealing their hidden truths would end up in giving them more fame and commercial gain.
Firstly celebrities are also human beings and they have right to enjoy the comfort of their personal life without having interference of the outside world. In ordinary life, they also behave, act and live like normal people. They also face numerous problems as other citizens of the country but to bring their personal issues to media is an immoral activity that should be discouraged by all means. They should be treated with care, respect and always acknowledge due to their works and achievement.
There is no denying that celebrities use such tactics to gain more success and fame in their professional career, discussing and portraying secrets of their life significantly increased their popularity and create a new horizon of opportunities for them. For instance Paris Hilton, a famous Hollywood actress was on the brink of her career end, released her sex tapes to drag the attention of a large audience, suddenly after the release she was in spotlight and limelight everywhere and also got more business afterwards.
To sum up, I would like to say that people’s privacy is their basic right that should be followed and exercised in all educated societies. However, some celebrities intentionally make them one to public to enjoy lucrative incentives associated with it.
Essay 404:
Selecting the right candidates for the jobs offered is not an easy task,  and it often requires extensive work such as data collection, screenings, scrutiny and interviewing before actually employing the employees. The interview is the most effective and fast way of finding the suitable candidates according to the nature of a job. Some other methods such as comprehensive written test, practical test and different scenarios could also help in this regard. I believe that interview is most successful and widely used technique to select the appropriate employees.
There is no doubt that interview plays a pivotal role in the recruitment process and has become a mandatory constituent of candidate selection process. Normally, interviews help employers to judge the expertise and knowledge of different candidates about the subject. Some other traits such as confidence, personality, intelligence and communication skills could only be evaluated through the interview. In addition, this is the most convenient and rapid way that could exercise without spending huge expenses and time.
However, sometimes candidates are unable to perform and express according to their strengths due to shyness and lack of confidence. By this way, employers fail to hire potential and knowledgeable persons. Other methods of choosing employees also significantly help at this time. Written test, practical demonstration of skills and making strategies in given situation are exceptional ways of knowing their strengths and weaknesses and are extensively used in institutions such as education, agriculture and army.
To sum up, I would like to say that the interview is commonly exercised in contemporary societies because of its effectiveness and higher success rate in selecting the right employees. Other ways of choosing employee are also helpful but demand more costs and time for their setup.
Essay 405:
Usages of social networking sites like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google + etc. have dramatically increased recently with the advancement of technology. Although, it has many detrimental effects on the society but its positive side cannot be neglected. I believe that technology has a significant contribution in bringing people closer around the globe and also as a source of cheap and efficient communication.
Social networking sites play a pivotal role in mitigating communication gap not only in the immediate social circle but also with friends and families in remote areas by sharing their news and updates. Social networking sites provide a rapid and effective way of interaction among people. Furthermore, many social groups exist on such sites which help people to find persons of the same interests and attitudes without confiding them to only geographical boundaries. It has recently been seen that many injustice and social issues were shared in social networking sites and that made a huge impact on authority and that has brought justice to the victims. Social networking sites are a common ground for mass people to share their updates, views and other details. Thus this has created a world without any boundary.
On the other hand, it is often seen that people have become disjointed and fragmented as the social networking sites become prevalent in societies and communities. Youngsters are more receptive to this change would like to spend most of their time on these sites. This has led dire consequences on their physical and psychological health. Moreover, families are greatly affected by this and their social bonding is no more present in contemporary days. People are getting addicted to these websites and thus becoming less social in many cases. Propaganda and fraud relationship have caused many personal and social dilemma.  
To sum up, I would like to say that people have become more social and interactive by the use of social networking sites. It gives people a sense of freedom to talk around the world without worrying about the huge cost that incurred previously. However, it has severe negative effects, as most of the people opt to talk using technology than meeting others in person due to their busy lifestyle, it increases  the distance in their relationship.
Essay 406:
Being a controversial subject among people, whether or not living in a private house outweighs being settled in an apartment, is not an easy decision. In this essay, the pros and cons of both these ways of living are going to be discussed.
People living in a house benefit their privacy as they do not have any neighbours in their place to share some areas like staircases or corridors. Besides, having a desirable garden could be a marked characteristic for individuals being interested in gardening and or providing a sufficient play area for their offspring and pets. Despite a variety of merits, possessing a house could embody some sort of difficulties ranging from low security to some extra maintaining expenses.
On the other hand, thanks to expanding the state-of-the-art lifestyle in the multitude of cities, especially the mega cities, living in an apartment is going to be more convenient because of some advantages. The main merit is that living in an apartment contributes to being more secured in comparison with a house, as the inhabitants need to take care of just one entrance and building guards provide higher security for the owners, as well. Low independence feeling, however, could be mentioned as the most significant drawback of a flat in a building, particularly towers.
In conclusion, all things considered, both circumstances of living possess their own plus and minus points. Nevertheless, I somewhat concur that due to the modern way of life in which plenty of people live, living in an apartment could be more profitable with regard to the level of security and lower cost of maintenance of property and some probable repairing issues.
Essay 408:
There have been dramatic changes in people’s lifestyle and eating habits over the last few years. Large numbers of people are more concerned about their health and they would like to do dieting, exercise and other physical activities to present themselves in good shape. Dieting is the activity that is more practicable in today’s world to reduce body weight. I believe that dieting badly affects our immune and digestion system and make us more susceptible to illness.
Many people do dieting to reduce their weight without realising its detrimental effect in their body. Firstly they will lack in physical activities and other works that demand hardworking and strength because they are not having sufficient intake of food to produce energy that is required for such activities. This will make them lethargic and their sedimentary lifestyle contributes to weight gain. Secondly, deficient energy in the body will affect the immune system that would show less resistance against viruses and make the human more open for diseases.
However, dieting plays a substantial role in controlling obesity and youngsters are more attracted towards this technique of weight loose. It helps them in reducing weight and also makes their body sound and finally helps them gain a good shape. In addition to this, dieting also helps in proper working of various organisms in the human body, that is also scientifically proved.
To sum up, I would like to say that dieting has more disadvantages that outweigh its advantages; people with healthy diet and lifestyle spend better life than others. Therefore, dieting impedes the progress of body and increase the risk of attacking germs and viruses.
Essay 409:
English is the most widely-spoken language in the world. In fact, it has gained so much importance in so many countries that it has become an international language. However, other languages like German, French and Spanish are also taught in schools and colleges as well in many countries. My opinion is that giving other foreign languages priority over the English language in schools is not a good idea.
Over the decade, many people from different cultures and countries have adopted the trend of going and study abroad. Many of them choose to start their careers there as well. At this point, they need to understand and speak English very well. It will help them to communicate with others and they have a better chance to of growth in their fields. From academic success till better presentation skill, from better persuasion till important international meeting and conference, English is needed everywhere. The knowledge of the second language is important but none of them excels the necessity of knowing English and this is why the schools should give priority to English over other foreign languages.
Learning English as a second language is being essential nowadays, as, people around the world understands English. It makes easier for you to visit any country. Most of the T V channels are in English. All information on the Internet is in English. If you know English you have better job or study opportunities as well. Learning other languages can only be beneficial as a hobby or if you are planning to visit that particular country. Other than that, I firmly agree that English is the necessity of today’s life.
To conclude, it is clearly understood that learning English is more constructive than any other foreign language. So a priority should be given in schools to teach English as a second language over other languages.
Essay 411:
Nowadays, thanks to modernisation, the method of teaching has changed considerably compared with decades ago. Developments have led students to spend more time on a variety of electronic communication devices and to become less flexible when it comes to learning lessons at school. However, I personally believe that the overall quality of learning has been fundamentally improved.
On one hand, in the past, teaching children was far simpler. One reason is that they did not have any access to other study resources. They had to follow their instructors’ rules to learn from theoretical and practical materials instead of using the Internet. For example, to learn English, students mostly used school laboratories and only listened to materials recommended by their teacher.  Now, students can listen and participate in hundreds of online courses through the web, each with different strategies which often confuse learners.  Another issue is that cyber-addiction has lead children to spend less time studying their basic books. Playing video games, which are upgraded every month, chatting on Facebook or texting friends mean children find less opportunity to study and practice their lessons.
On the other hand, some social networks and telecommunication systems are extremely useful to children. The primary factor is online learning which has become a popular method of teaching in many countries. For instance, to learn biology, children can search and find a variety of topics on the web in few seconds, or download their favourite video lessons by paying a very modest amount of money. Tutors, therefore, spend only a few hours teaching the related subjects in school. Furthermore, social networks have assisted pupils in understanding the materials better. Obviously, in many schools, colleges or even universities, students are encouraged to create study groups and participate in discussions, collecting information far more easily than in the past. In particular, at MIT in the USA, students have private accounts and can connect to any other student in the US university system.  This gives them access to a far wider range of materials, ideas and approaches to data than learning in the past.
In conclusion, although children had more time to study classroom materials in the past, now they get a better quality of teaching. In my view, online learning and participating in vast educational study groups has led them to learn than in the past.
Essay 413:
Computers today are most common and their gaming aspect is a cult among the teenagers. Computer games are considered to have numerous bad effects, but I think if used in moderation they can be used as an effective tool for learning and development.
Computer games are considered as a social evil in the society as they are associated with the dogma of time-wasting for school going students. To some extent, that may be true but everything about these games is not negative. Computer games help younger children to develop good hand-eye coordination which is crucial in their early stages. They are also full of fantasies which eventually aid in developing children' brains to be more imaginative and innovative.
On the other hand, spending a long time on the computer not only wastes valuable time but also renders users physically inactive. Health hazards associated to this mainly includes obesity, weak eyes,  lower back problems and so on. Apart from this, cognitive development, which is critical during childhood, tends to go for toss thanks to increased addiction to gaming. These problems are a cause of concern among parents.
To curb their negative aspects, parents should keep strict control over the time children are exposed to these games and should promote engagement in physical and brain games. In fact, game producing companies have also realised this and have started preparing gaming consoles which involve more physical movement, suggesting that everyone is doing their bit to promote the positive aspects of this innovation.
Essay 414:
Death toll has been increased significantly in various parts of the world over the last few years. Large numbers of casualties are happening due to over speeding, violation of traffic rules and poor infrastructure of roads. People associated with traffic department claim that rash driving, excessive speed of cars and unwilling attitude to follow rules and regulation by drivers are the primary reasons for accidents. However, drivers say that lack of preemptive measures, inadequate road facilities and pathetic design of roads immensely increased the risk of accidents. I believe that both drivers and traffic designers are mutually responsible for the rise of road tragedies.
It is the main responsibility of traffic department to take necessary measures to control such incidents by introducing legislation for driving. Firstly, there is a need to fix the speed limit while driving in the city and outside city. Surveillance cameras should be installed on busiest parts of the city to monitor speed limit. Furthermore, new and strict rules of law should be implemented. People found guilty of breaking laws should be sentenced to jail or imposed heavy fines.
Drivers can play a pivotal role in mitigating the traffic woes. They should be given training of driving and a need of comprehensive test that include both practical and theoretical test. This will ensure their capacity of driving and knowledge about traffic rules. In addition to this, Government should make attempts to organise seminars and workshops to increase awareness among drivers.
To sum up, I would like to say that it is an equal responsibility of both drivers and lawmakers to take precautionary steps to avoid any injuries. There is dire need of legislation on the traffic designers end and also need to create perceptiveness among drivers.
Essay 415:
There are arguments that students who graduated from high school should have a year break before enrolling in college or university as it will give them several opportunities and advantages. However, other individuals believe that students must have a continuous education. It seems reasonable to argue that a year break between secondary and tertiary education is not a reasonable perspective.
Primarily, it is often said that if a student decided to give himself a one year vacation before pursuing the higher education, he or she might b able to gain work experiences. Obviously, the student can use the experiences once he or she applied as a professional employee in a certain institution. This is because most of employers often seek workers who have numerous work experiences and credentials. Linked to this is the fact that every high school graduate student has encountered the pressure of studying difficult subjects such as geometry and physics. Thus, a year break will give the student a chance to indulge in his or her desired activities. Understandably, the schedule in some high schools consumes most of the students’ time, which could have been spent on relaxation or hobbies.
Besides, the year gap could be used to travel extensively and that would be an excellent opportunity for them to gather firsthand experience about the different cultures and countries. Students who get practical job experience can learn money management and learn to appreciate the value of money. The experience gathered from job and travel often helps them to excel in their academic studies when they start their academic years in university.
However, it cannot be denied that students may find it difficult to adjust to the lessons and topics being discussed at the primary level in college. One major reason of this is that the students could forget the knowledge they have learned during their high school days. As can be expected, in college, some professors appear to start at basic subjects, such as algebra and English, in order to help the students adapt to the level of difficulty. In addition to this, the students could be enticed to abandon their studies because they might think that the salaries in their temporary occupations are enough to supplement their financial needs. For instance, some students in the Philippines are attracted by the higher salaries offered in non-skilled jobs, which make them sacrifice their education.
In conclusion, I am convinced that a year break must not be encouraged to every high school graduate student due to the fact that it may ruin the student’s education. It is very likely that all students will procure better jobs which offer a higher salary if they finish their education.
Essay 417:
Almost all governments, across the globe, have a yearly budget to distribute money for various activities. I agree that governments should allocate a higher budget for education compared to recreation and sports. This can be proven by analysing, how spending more money on education can reduce unemployment rate as well as decrease crime rate and can positively enhance the people’s life standard.
If more people are educated in a country, it is apparent that the employment rate of that nation will be high, as there are a lot of skilled employments available throughout the world. But to have many people educated, the governments should provide good education system which is affordable by the citizens. For example, as per the report published in the Week magazine during August 2015, America has very less unemployment rate as the government provides best quality education to the citizens at a very minimal fee. Thus, it is obvious that the government should focus on spending more on the education sector. The recreation and sports activities are also important for people but the education has far better importance.
As the society has more social knowledge, the crime rate will be reduced. This is due to the fact that education creates a positive mentality among the people. For instance, as per the BBC report telecasted on January 2015, Nigeria has a crime rate which is 20 times more than the USA. Therefore it is the responsibility of the governments to ensure that the citizens are educated by providing adequate infrastructure. In addition to that, governments should even make the secondary education free and mandatory. Hence it is very clear that governments must allocate a higher budget for education. Sports and other recreation can improve people’s life standard but what benefits it can bring when the people have poverty and they are engaging in crime?
By analysing how allocating more money for education can increase employment rate and make the earth a safer place to live, it is very important that governments should allocate a higher percent of the budget on education. It is predicted that importance is given to recreation and sports as well, but not at the cost of education.
Essay 418:
Due to the natural reasons, people find it difficult to change the ways they live. It is quite difficult for a majority of people to alter the state of mind, the way they think and the environment they get used to. Therefore several problems can occur when they are told to do and solve their issues in easier and more decent ways. In my opinion, obvious solutions knock the door of psychologists and also family members and relatives should act in these positions. Changes in some cases are inevitable and embracing the new idea and way of life bring many opportunities and hence accepting new things are often not options, but mandatory for us.
In modern life, people adjust to different habits and routines and then they do not tend to get involved to change their usual activities. By doing this, they decline any other offer presented by surroundings, especially when these offers are from ones that they do not like. Because of that their resistance increases in not changing. For example, when a parent asked their kid to not do disobedience or not eat chocolate too much, this kid's persistence in the matter sometimes enhances as far as parents ask. That's why the worst and most difficult of the problem is the resistance of children's unruly behaviour. If these issues are not undertaken by someone responsible and coped with the problem, its consequences stay to the rest of child's life vitally.
New ideas, technology and changes are often for better ways of life. Not being able to grip the new idea and changes can bring personal and social problems. Parents who cannot embrace the idea of modernization and generation gaps often have bitter experience with their children. Changes in society are also natural with time and the old way life will not remain forever. New ideas often come to people with open and broader perspective. Old traditions have their importance but new customs, ideas and changes should also be accepted for the overall betterment of the society.
A healthy family and social relationship, use of technology, guidance and mutual understanding people of different generations can minimise this problem to a great extent. It is natural that old people will not easily accept the radical changes of ideas, values and way of life. New generations should talk to them, discuss them and present the good sides of the changes they have accepted.
To conclude, it is best to consult these overwhelming behaviours to an expert for the sake of the welfare of both the people and the society. By the help of modern psychology I do not think of a problem unsolved, and besides this is a crucial problem for a society that comprised of healthy-thinking people.
Essay 420:
It is a fact that in many countries the government set some standards about a safe workplace, such as wearing some protection gears in the workplace. I personally support the idea as working in a safe condition is an essential fact, and the following essay will discuss it in details.
To begin with, it is true that in certain countries, the government is concerned about the safe work environment. As injuries and accidents at work have been frequently reported, the government set some policies about safety at work, which covers so many aspects. One of the examples is that heavy industry companies should provide their workers with the appropriate safety equipment, as the risk of being injured at work is high in this industry. In another example, drivers of special vehicles such as bulldozer or forklift must have a registered certificate or a special license, as driving these vehicles requires special techniques.
If I have the authority to set some regulations about safety, I would set these kinds of policies. Firstly, every company should make a report about health, safe and green environment in their workplace. This report should be submitted to the authority on an annual basis, and companies who fail to submit their report on time will be charged with penalties. Secondly, there would be a regulation about safety audit. The government should set some audit teams, which will inspect companies’ safety environment during their work hour. Companies with unsatisfactory audit result must be reassessed during the renewal of their business licenses. By having these two policies, it is hoped that companies will implement a safe and healthy working environment in their workplace.
In conclusion, I strongly agree that safety at work is an important thing, as many governments have set some specific rules about it. Should I be the authorised person, I would make some safety regulations which enforce companies to make a timely safety report, and conduct safety audits.
Essay 422:
Sport is an important constituent of education at school and universities. However, there is a dramatic shift in this trend in some developing countries over the last few years. The authorities concerned claim that lengthy syllabus, competitive learning and studies pressure are the main hindrances that mitigate student interest to pursue in this field. I think this is not a good practice to exercise; children should provide opportunities to participate in physical activities that would help them in relaxing and developing skills such as leadership, teamwork and handling pressure.
Sports play a pivotal role in health and could significantly contribute towards achieving others skills that are also important for a successful person. For instance, lack of these activities will make people lethargic and they will become more susceptible to diseases such as obesity and laziness. Furthermore, it is also seen that students without these activities are more hyper and violent in their attitudes, this will lead to severe problems in the society.
Nowadays, students have to perform exceptionally well in order to compete in their peer group. That increased panic, tension and un-relaxing conditions. Therefore, exercise is a one way that can reduce their studies woes and help them to relax and reenergize for their future studies. In addition to this, students who are good in sports activities can adopt it as their future career.
To sum up, I would like to say that eliminating sports activities from school curriculum would have dire consequences on students and society. We would less likely to produce players for our nation teams. Apart from that students' mental health negatively affect with the absence of sports.
Essay 423:
A rapid increment in private-owned vehicles has caused roads become more congested. If preventive measures are not applied in time, this might create difficult situation globally. As vehicles are now an inseparable part of human life, both government and individuals should inhabit some measures.
Government plays a vital role in managing vehicles number and size of roads. The government can adopt measures like higher tax-rate, public awareness programmes and wider road construction to manage traffic and discourage the rapid growth in the private vehicles. Another solution to this problem is to encourage people to use public transportation by carefully managing routes. Also, small public vehicles can be replaced by bigger vehicles and cost of using public transportation should be remarkably lower than using private vehicles. Finally, implementing more effective traffic rules can have marked positive result in both minimising the growth rate of private-owned vehicles and managing traffic problems.
Along with the government, individuals also play an important role in this context. The preventive solution that an individual can apply is to minimise the use of private-owned vehicles when not necessary. People should use public transportation services as it reduces the problem of road congestion and use of fuel as well. Encouraging friends, family and neighbours to use private-owned vehicles only when necessary can be another effective measure as well. Individuals should follow traffic rules strictly and encourage the government to adopt effective solutions.

From my point of view, it is undeniably essential to keep our globe safe from greenhouse gases. It is evident that cars or any gas-fueled vehicle produce these harmful gases. Something has to be done to prevent greenhouse effect and using electric cars could be a good way of preventing it.
It can be clearly seen that gas-fueled vehicles comprise the majority of the causes of the greenhouse effect. Today, developers have discovered new electric cars that have adequate speed and are equally comfortable. Once these new, innovative cars have been fully charged, it can travel long distances with moderate speed. In spite of these cars are slightly expensive, they are undoubtedly prominent for both our health and our planet's safety. So some incentive measures to make people embrace electric cars should have taken. For this reason, people have to be introduced about how perilous these gas-fueled vehicles are. In this case, governments have a great deal of responsibility to get over that. For instance, the advertisement boards on the side of the roads are one of the optimal places to inform people. In addition, social networks or TVs could introduce the aspects of the electric cars. Furthermore, petrol is diminishing with a great acceleration. Consequently, petrol has a limited source, despite electric energy is unlimited that they can be obtained by solar or wind power. In addition, electric energy has limited wastages, but gas has a lot of wastes and one of these wastes is a threat to our lives.
The government can fund the car producers to produce cheap electric cars and transportations. Less tax on electric cars could also be an effective solution as it would arrest more people to purchase them.
To sum up, gas-fueled cars have a lot of drawbacks in terms of its fumes and environmental damage, although there is no marked disadvantage that can threaten our lives in electric cars. Funding, less tax and advertisement can attract more people to use this sort of cars.
Essay 425:
Uniform is a mandatory constituent of schools in most of the countries and children are obligated to wear uniforms during school hours. Some people argue that children should have a freedom to dress up according to their own preference. However, others claim that uniform at schools is a symbol of unity among students and a way to disregard discrimination as well. I strongly believe that uniform has social and ethical significance on children and should be a mandatory part of their education.
There is no doubt that uniform has substantial impacts on children. It gives them a feeling that they belong to the same group of people, thus help in creating stronger bonding with each other. Furthermore, uniform eliminates the element of discrimination among students, as both rich and poor students are obligated to dress in the same way. People on the public places can easily distinguish the school children and this offers some benefits.
However, allowing others dresses than uniform could deteriorate the situation. This would lead to severe problems such as inferiority complex, shattering confidence and other social issues and that have detrimental effects on children's mind. In addition to this, buying new clothes would be an additional expense that could be very difficult for poor people to fulfil.
To draw the conclusion, I would like to say that uniform is an essential part of schooling and should not be neglected at any cost. It gives them the impression that they belong to the same family and this makes them thrive in their studies and sports. Banning uniform is not a healthy activity and could leave bad effects in children attitudes.
Essay 426:
Nowadays, people are highly ambitious towards their career while maintaining their healthy lifestyle. There is no doubt that it is not an easy task and it required lots of efforts and will-power.  Therefore, this has led to various issues such as lack of attention in home chores, avoiding responsibilities etc. However, keeping a balance between office and home life could dramatically change the situation.
The problems arise when people start avoiding taking interest for home and they start focusing mainly on their career growth. By this I mean that their primary focus of interest shifted from home to office work. Furthermore, lack of attention towards family could create isolation in the family that will have dire consequences on children. The competitive job responsibilities and enhanced working time are also contributing to the lack of attention many people put for their family.
However, sharing responsibilities, cooperating with each other would definitely help in these circumstances. The best possible solution is to make a balance in their lives by giving proper time and attentions on both sides. Cooperation and adjustment within family members would leave an undeniable impression on their lives. Moreover, by dividing responsibilities and sharing tasks will ensure a smooth running of matters. Women can also play a pivotal role by supporting their husbands in different aspects of life. Their participation and interest is a key for happy life.
To sum up, I would like to say that great achievements always come with sacrifices. However, by getting support from family and peer group help in getting the desired result. Therefore, individuals should keep striving for bright future while continuing happy and healthy relations at home.
Essay 427:
Most of the countries in the world are led by men, only a few countries are governed by women. I personally think that whether a government or a leadership brings violence or peace has nothing to do with the gender of the leader.
It is generally believed that women have gentler personality than men in the way they act. But, it does not guarantee that if a woman leads a country or a society, they can prevent conflicts, clash or violence from happening because a leader is not the only party causing or triggering conflicts. In running her government and taking a decision or a policy, a female leader cooperates with and discusses a lot with many other parties so I do not think that her mother figure will come first in dealing with various complicated problems her government is facing. Instead, she can not give priority to her feminine feeling (caring, loving, affecting, etc) in policy making. A leader, either female or male, needs to take action in accordance with the situation. That is why I believe that the gender of a leader makes no difference in this issue. Many countries like Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan were governed by female leaders and yet the conflict and violence increased during their time and this is a clear indication that a female leader cannot guarantee and peaceful society.
Moreover, conflicts often happen because of inability or bad leadership skill of a leader in running his or her leadership. In any country, the incapability of leaders, regardless of their gender, causes many problems leading to the unsatisfactory of people and the decrease in people’s trust level to the government, both of which are likely to result in chaos, clash, and conflict. I am convinced that everyone will agree that capability and leadership skill have nothing to do with gender. It is ridiculous to judge that men have a better capability in leading an organisation than women, or vice versa. Besides, the success and the failure of an organisation or a government are determined not only by the leader but also the staffs and the cabinet. No matter how capable the leader is, he or she will not be able to execute his or her government programs to bring prosperity for his or her people and to satisfy them if he or she does not have a good team.
In conclusion, the ability of a country to avoid and prevent conflict and violence depends on the capability of the leader, regardless of gender, to run the country. It is not wise to say that men with their masculinity bring violence and none can guarantee that women with their femininity will be able to bring peace for people.
Essay 429:
There has been a significant increase in travelling over the last few years.  People tend to travel for the sake of entertainment, exploration and business activities. Some people argue that travellers should obey and respect about religious beliefs and tradition of the countries they visited. Others claim that visitors are not bound to practice the local people beliefs and should have the independence to live according to their own set of rules. I strongly believe that foreigners must act accordingly to the traits and norms of visiting country.
It is commonly seen that some of the travellers do not care about others sentiments and they like to perform their own rituals openly in public places. They claim that it is permissible in free and open society. However, this could have detrimental effects as some people could act violently and can create riots in a society.
On the other side, it is our moral and ethical duty to respect others religions. Being as a visitor one has to follow the customs, traditions and traits of the destination country. This will help them in knowing about cultures and others traits of the society. This will also leave a positive message to the local people.
To conclude, I would like to say that tourists represent their country and their acts and behaviour can help in developing their good image to outside world. Therefore, travellers and business people should mould themselves according to place and situation; it is also a natural phenomenon that ‘gives respect take respect’.
Essay 431:
Today, more than ever, when it comes to the issue of determining whether or not advances in technology affect the types of relationship individual make a plethora of perspective have been put forward. The expansion of modern means of communication is the ongoing debate which triggers so much controversy. This issue is fiercely criticised by some experts who are on the view that they pose a direct threat to social lives and may come at the expense of a severe social isolation and sedentary lifestyle. Others realise the significance of these means of communications and stick to the idea that these types of relationship are integral parts of interpersonal communication. Consequently, they are regarded as worthwhile. Nevertheless, as far as I am concerned, the opinion put forth by the second group is more logical. In the following paragraphs, I will shed light on my own attitudes for this issue.
To begin with, in the past, communication among people looked bleak. People used to meet and make an appointment to see each other and in according to the fact that communities had busy people and they seem doomed to have far-reaching communication.
In the second place, modern means of communication command people’s attention. They are the fastest and easiest way of togetherness. People are at the mercy of virtual world to have opportunities to get in touch with others even in the remotest part of the world which contributes to saving their time and hanging out every moment. This issue questions the need to have face to face interactions.
To cut a long story short, for better or worse, we live in a world which is surrounded by computers, cell phones on an unprecedented scale with which people spend their spare time. The truth is that, in this hectic lifestyle, the responsibility of real-time conversations, visualisation of each other, information exchange which enables individual to share a variety of information such as activities, events, interests, ideas falls on these ways of communication. Thanks to tremendous advances in technology.
Last but not least, emails and messages make people more comfortable which pave the way for explaining their feeling without shyness and give them a sense of absolute confidence, also they are the backbone of introducing friends among youth which increase their social friendship.
In conclusion, all in all, rather than devoting a great deal of time and energy solely in terms of face to face interaction, the trend today is toward using modern means of communication to get  in touch with others. The pivotal role these ways of communication performed in interpersonal communication is hard to ignore. However, many people fail to appreciate it.
Essay 433:
Modern medicine and developments in medical science have solved the impossible task of conquering many fatal diseases. Therefore people attain the relief of long, happy and painless lives. Some of the numerous outcomes of this relief are rescue from long-term and painful anxieties, accumulation of concentration on subjects that are usually very difficult to do it under painful circumstances and more significantly the importance of healthy decision-making. Apart from that long accumulated experience of older people are helpful for developing a better society.
Firstly, the anxiety of pain absorbs the energy of life in people. Thus individuals with diseases spread this weakness to their environment and also they cannot help it. From the other way, it is almost impossible to illustrate enough attempts and pay sufficient attention to either the issues of family and friends or problems and tasks of their jobs as their other fellows. For example, if there is an occupation takes place like job trips, family organisations, they find it difficult adjust to the mood of other members of family and friends.
However, their families try to make them as happy as possible. But these problems have been transcended by appropriate treatments and ill people do not need to feel awful anymore. Nevertheless the most difficult period in life, in my opinion, is ill time. Because illness compels people to change their way of thinking and decision-making, in some cases some people try to even suicide because of the pain. It is the heartbreaking part of the story.
Although, today with the cooperation of psychologists and doctors most cases of trauma and suicide can be handled. And many diseases with proper medications and operations can be recovered. The experience of older people who live longer can be useful for the new generation and professionals like teachers, politicians, mathematicians, physicists and social workers can contribute more to the world.
Essay 434:
The main reason of poor education quality among children nowadays is that they spend a lot of  their time watching television programmes and do things that are remotely connected to quality education. I completely agree with the statement that television cannot replace the book as a learning tool as it is far less educative and far more addictive.
Firstly, television cannot replace books as learning materials owing to the fact that children often misuse television in the disappearance of parents. For instance, educative programs are less attractive than the cartoon shows and other programs children prefer to watch. While there are lots of educative and suitable programs, it is not unusual that a child would prefer to watch programs that entertain more than educating.
Another reason television is not as suitable as a book because when children learn through television then their focus will be on audio-visual presentation, not in learning. Whereas if they follow books then they focus on books and the lessons it offers.
It is often heard that many children watch TV for long hours and that is detrimental to their health. Television programs are addictive and many children do not concentrate on other important things like study or outdoor activity when they become addicted to watching TV programs.
Finally, television cannot replace the book as learning tool due to television might be a tool that would be wastage of time.  However, if children spend more time in reading books there is no chance of wastage of time. The primary focus of television is entertaining people while books are considered as the cornerstone of knowledge and wisdom.
To conclusion, although television is more entertaining than books, it cannot become a great tool for education as books are for children. The book is still the most appropriate learning tool and the television can never replace it terms of child’s education.
In the current world, visual media has a huge presence across the globe. Television is being widely used as a supplement for education by students. In my opinion, books can never be replaced by television as a means of learning gadget. This can be proven by analysing how books have the advantage that they can focus on a particular subject deeply as well as provide time flexibility.
It is apparent that a particular book focuses on a specific subject. As most of the programs in the television are sponsored by an organisation, advertisement runs at regular intervals between the programs the people watch. In the case of books, advertisements are very rare and thus there are limited distractions on learning a subject. Moreover, we can turn back the pages we have covered, if any doubt arises reading the further topics. As per the report released on 25th September 2015, by the Week magazine, 90% of the school students prefer books over the television for educational purposes. Thus books have an edge over television. Television programmes are aimed to entertain people when there are very few educative channels for students. Moreover, there is no surety that a student would spend his time in front of the TV productively.
Another important advantage books have is the ability of the readers to choose the time to read as per their convenience. It is a fact that some students like to read in the early morning while some others in the evening, so that they have maximum concentration. But in case of television, unless we have digital storage devices like DVD or USB drive; it is not possible to play as we need. Furthermore, most of the television programmes have a schedule and the students need to be punctual in case they need to attend it. It is obvious that book gives the users to plan their time as per their wish.
 As a conclusion, it is obvious that books have an advantage over television, as it provides deeper concentration on the subjects and better time management. It is predicted that a few subjects, which requires visual effect to understand, may choose television as a mean of the learning tool.
Television is an inseparable thing for the new generation today. The advancement in the television industry has changed the way man lives today by bringing him every event that is happening around the world and providing all kinds of entertainment to watch from home. For better or worse people are addicted to television programs and spend a great deal of time watching it.
The impact of television on children is a matter of worry for many, especially for parents, as children are the most passionate about televisions today. Unlike a generation ago, where children were spending their time reading books or doing outdoor activities that help them in their personal, intellectual and physical development, today's children are more preferred to sit at home and relax watching their favourite television channel will definitely have an advert impact on their development. Television can bring in educational programs for children but it cannot replace the tradition way of studying from books!
Books are subject specific and have a great amount of well-focused information for children to study. Apart from teaching specific subjects, it also helps children to learn to read, write and make decisions. On the other hand, television programmes to teach the same subject will not bring in these benefits and make the children a lazy learner. Moreover, children are not keen to watch such educational programs. They are more interested in watching sports, movies and cartoons which may not have educational concepts but more of an entertainment factors.
Obviously, the more time children spend on television is the less time they get for studying from books and thus impact the quality of their education. This would remain as a challenge for today's parents, teachers and society.
Essay 435:
Many developing and developed countries are spending huge amounts of money on space exploration. They are keenly interested in finding out the existence of life on galaxies and stars. This is a lengthy process, which required huge funds and time. People argue that space exploration is a waste of time and money. This amount should be spent on other problems. I believe that helping and improving living standard of poor nations is the best way to use the money.
Rich nations play a pivotal role in bringing change and prosperity for poor nations. Developing countries such as Africa, Syria etc. have serious problems in health, education and employment sectors. That could only be solved with the help of developed nations. Many countries are giving financial aids and others are investing directly in order to solve and mitigate the woes of peoples and received respect and gratitude in this regard.
However, discovering unresolved mysteries is a real challenge for the scientist. Many countries are funding research centres to unfold hidden mysteries of the world. This is time consuming and lengthy work. Scientists are in search of natural resources that are less in quantity on earth. Their success could substantially change the world and will open a new horizon of success.
To conclude, I believe that it is an ethical and moral responsibility of nations to eradicate problems in their neighbouring countries. Meanwhile, research on space exploration should be continued until we get desired results. It is a time-consuming process but it will leave undeniable benefits on people lives in case of success.
Essay 437:
The tourism industry has flourished significantly over the last few years. Large numbers of people travel around the globe, which brings money and prosperity to the visiting country. Some people argue that tourists create lots of pollution by throwing garbage which required extra effort and money to clean. Thus should be charged more. However, others state that they bring business to the country and should charge nominally. I believe that foreign visitors help native peoples in order to run their business by using their services.
Tourists play a pivotal role in strengthening the economy of the destination country. Countries such as Malaysia and Singapore mainly depend on their tourism industry. They are spending a huge amount of money to preserve their historical places. That will attract millions of tourists to travel these countries every year. In addition to this, tourist used local services such as hotels, restaurant, clothes and health facilities. This helped local peoples to run their business smoothly.
However, tourists also bring waste and diseases with themselves. This could severely harm the health of local peoples. For example, the epidemic of Malaysia was due to a foreign visitor. Furthermore, tourists are lethargic and do not care about cleaning, and would like to throw garbage and other waste materials anywhere they want. This required extra cost to clean and preserve the beauty of the surrounding nature.
In conclusion, I believe that we should welcome tourist whole-heartedly and let them enjoy their holidays economically. This would leave positive impression on their mind and a reason to visit the place again.
Essay 439:
It is often seen that universities provide the best education to their students and prepare them as the ideal citizens of the nation. They also focus on physical health by offering them various sports facilities. Some people argue that sports are equally important and must have the same allocation of funds as university libraries. However, others state that main aptitude of educational institutions is to provide lofty education and must invest handsome amount for the betterment of libraries. I agree to some extent that role of  the library is far more important than sports activities.
It is very important to have good physical education for students. It will not only improve their health but also helped them in developing skills such as teamwork, handling pressure under tensed situations etc. Therefore, it is required by the universities to spend on this constituent. Furthermore, nowadays there is too much study pressure on students. In order to relax and re-energise, such activities should be provided at a regular interval.
Library is an essential part of every educational institution. Large numbers of students rely on libraries to complete their assignments, research works and final projects. It shows that existence of a university is incomplete without having one or more libraries in it. Thus, a huge amount should be invested in libraries to improve its books catalogue.  Latest books, journals and other reference materials should be incorporated in libraries to facilitate its users.
To sum up, I would like to say that spending time in libraries is more worthful and has lofty values than playing. Universities must upgrade their libraries accordance with technological advancement without considering the cost so that numerous benefits could be taken out.
Essay 440:
It is true that the motive of people who do shopping has changed these days. Though I agree with the opinion that they do not value the worth of money, not all individuals are alike. In this essay, I will support my stand by showing that only till a certain age people are not able to understand the value of money.
There are at least few people who are really shopping for needs. For instance, almost all of the family men and women analyse their requirements, income they earn and put a monthly budget. In this case, since they have to run their families and take care of their wants of everyone in the family like parents and children, they should definitely adhere to their budget and run the family. Be it a shopping from clothes or groceries or any other commodity arises only out of the dire need for it.
On the other side, I also accept that number of citizens who has taken up shopping as a hobby has increased in the recent past. The poor parenting is the root cause of this phenomenon. It is quite natural that the middle-class parents pamper their children and get things done beyond their limit. As a result, the children do not have an opportunity to analyse the cost. Consequently, when this child grows up in the society, the shopping mentality remains the same. Bothering less about the need and the prize of the product, they do shopping.
It should also be noted that shopping as a leisure activity remains only till a certain age limit. This new form of hobby has cropped up only among youngsters. This is proved by the recent survey on the shopping habits of men and women. Till the individuals strive hard to earn each penny, they will never ever realise the worth of it. Once they start earning, they could analyse the need and cost of the product they buy.
After analysing the development it is not hard to see that shopping habits have changed in the recent decades and it is also sure that every individual will not get attracted to materialistic life after a certain age since they get matured enough to consider the necessity and cost of the products more than anything.
Essay 441:
It is true that a recent trend of replacing the experienced old workers with young talents has cropped up in every industry. In my opinion, not all the old workers should be replaced by young individuals.
Experienced employees of every industry should be considered as valuable assets. This is because their experience in the company would be definitely proportional to their loyalty and gratitude towards the employers which is an added advantage. Such Emotionally bonded employees would work sincerely for the development of the company. This is not all; their total experience could never be replaced by anything which implies that they would have sound practical knowledge. Therefore it is always better for the businesses to retain their older employees in spite of recruiting freshers.
On the other hand, fresh graduates are the need of the hour to make the industry sustain in the prevailing high competition. The world has become revolutionised with the advancements in technology and thus a people with cutting edge technical skills are needed in every industry for its economic growth.
Contrarily, it is not a wise decision to fire the old and experienced employees considering age as the only factor. Their experience should be valued, although they might not be aware of updated technologies. There would be problems wherein freshers could find difficulty. In this case, they certainly need guidance. Why can’t every industry use their senior employees as a mentor to train fresh trainees?
It should also be taken into consideration that an industry should be ruthless at times, in my opinion, to make its progress consistent. So if work like marketing and sales involves an old aged employee who is really getting weak, then the wisest decision would be to replace him or her with a young and energetic person. It is not that the older one should be fired but can be used as a resource person for the industry.
To conclude, both old and young employees are the prerequisites for a healthy work- environment. There should be a mutual sharing of knowledge and skills for the upliftment of the industry. But, few people whose age is an issue for their work could be replaced with young individuals and not all.
Essay 442:
Having an efficient workforce has always been one of the most complicated issues faced by industries and companies all around the world. Thus, it is quite controversial whether older experienced workers should be substituted with younger ones. Since strong arguments exist in support of both notions, both of them should be discussed carefully before any conclusion is drawn. However, my personal opinion is that a younger workforce for industry is more important.
On the one hand, old workers can contribute vital benefits to the industry due to their sufficient experience in the sector. The first and foremost benefit obtained from old workers is that they know the existing system of the industry quite well. Regarding powerful and weak sides of the industry, they can decide solutions in the most convenient and efficient ways. Furthermore, industries should appreciate their work experience and utilise their knowledge comprehensively in order to maximize the profit rate.
A strong argument can ofcourse be made from the opposite position. Young people are enthusiastic and full of new ideas. Since they are never afraid of taking risks, they can utilise chances maximumly. Due to youngsters' creativeness and efforts, the industry can boost its profit and enhance its facility. Hence, if industries aim to promote productiveness, they should encourage young workers and give broader chances to them. Moreover, young people have greater exposure to new technologies which is a substantial advantage of having them.
On all accounts, although older workers have sufficient experiences, industries should promote more young workers in order to acquire accomplishments. As far as I am concerned, we should inspire the young generation, because we should not forget that they are builders of our future life.
Essay 443:
While many people have abundant luxuries, others suffer from unimaginable poverty and lack the basic human needs like food and shelter. Home is one of the five most fundamental needs for every human and government of a country should try in every way possible to make sure that there is no homeless in the country.
From the very ancient time till today, people’s need for a safe place to live in is considered to be a very fundamental need. This is how the concept of home has emerged and only homeless people can understand the sufferings of not having a shelter. Poor people who cannot manage a decent meal every day often live under the open sky. This is inhuman and the government of a country has a natural obligation to ensure the living places for people. When a government has the responsibility to ensure economic development, infrastructure development, education, roads and highway, protecting people from criminals why providing such a basic need like home for homeless people is in a debate? A huge amount of money spent on research every year and what good those research could bring to the citizens of a country when there are large numbers of people who are living without any shelter?
Natural calamities like flood, tsunami and earthquake make many people homeless and the national and international supports then should always keep the shelter in priority for such victims. War is still a curse in the world we live in and because of that a great number of people are forced to leave their houses and become homeless. Should not rich nations, the government of the country and capable individuals raise their helping hands to ensure the shelter of homeless people? The answer is always yes. That’s what makes us human. When we live in a luxurious building, many others are sleeping beside the pavement. Should not a government be considered a failure when they would spend millions of dollars for space research while there would be thousands of people homeless in the country?
Homeless people would unsurprisingly get involved in crimes and the society would face more trouble controlling them. So from this perspective, a government should focus on ensuring homes for every family. In fact, the loan, mortgage and subsidiary system we notice in many developed countries like the UK and the USA are aimed to help people to have their own home.   
To conclude, a living place is one of the most basic needs of every human being and the government of a country should always take initiatives to make sure that there are no homeless people in the country. 
Essay 445:
It is perceived by many that metropolitan cities are ominous for our well-being as opposed to living in rural areas. While the former offers a hectic lifestyle and have much more pollution, the latter grants a tranquil and favourable environment for our physical and psychological benefits. I completely agree with this viewpoint for several reasons.
Firstly, almost all big cities have an intolerable level of air, sound and environmental pollutions primarily due to the increasing number of vehicles, carbon emission, wastages of industries, metro facilities and amenities for a modern lifestyle. On top of that, the population density in big cities is much higher, and it creates an unhealthy living standard in many parts. Finally, people in big cities often rely on processed food as they are busy. This unhealthy food habit, along with pollution, emerges as a serious threat to their health in the long run.  For instance, more than 60 per cent of school students in large municipalities in developing countries are exposed to a higher level of air and sound pollutions and eat junk food which severely affects their physical and mental health.
Secondly, it is generally known that stresses in metropolises are considerably higher due to many factors. One of the main factors is the long working hours. Secondly, living costs in big cities are high. Although people earn higher in metro areas, their salaries, oftentimes, do not meet their needs and expectations, which adversely impact their psychology. Long working hours combined with severe traffic jam consume their time and they have little time left to spend with their families.
To conclude, it is inevitable that pollution, stresses and unhealthy food jeopardize people’s health in big cities, and this is why it is justified to state that living in large cities is damaging for people's well-being.
Essay 447:
t is a true fact to consider that there has been a great debate on whether to spend a huge amount of money to explore outer space or not. Considering this, there are some analysts who hold an opinion that spending money for the exploring outer space is most important due to the expansion of human knowledge, while other consider that as a money wasting activity and opine that it can be better used to mitigate some urgent matters we have in this world. This essay will show assertion on both sides of the contention before arriving at a reasonable conclusion.
First and foremost, poverty could be a significant factor why space research should be given less priority. It is generally seen thousands of people everyday starve or lack from very basic human needs. A large number of people in the world are still struggling to find foods, clothes, medicines etc. and the amount of money we are spending just to reach further in the space or to know more is overwhelming. So many people consider space research as an unnecessary activity while they focus on eliminating more pressing problems are living in. Fatal diseases could be another burning problem that needs more research and prevention. So money and manpower used for space exploration are not justified to many.
There are some groups who are in favour of spending more money to explore outer space for the  improvement of human knowledge, in spite of views discussed above regarding waste of money that are valid reasons for spending money for the exploring outer space. These groups of people believe that space exploration is required for our own benefits: to search for other intelligent species, to understand the universe, to find more resources for human or even to find a suitable place in another planet for human to live. They believe that wars, crime and corruptions are causing more problems and costing more than the outer space exploration. They feel that we should understand the model of our universe and learn the history of it for the greater good of human.    
In summary, undoubtedly, spending a portion of the budget to explore outer space should be allowed; however, as far as I am concerned, governments should take more responsibilities to improve nations and ensure basic human needs before spending too much on outer world research.
Essay 448:
It is an undeniable fact that tourist spots in every country have become more popular and have so many visitors. The development of tourism has so many benefits, such as more income from tourists and exposure of culture, although the drawbacks of this development cannot be ignored. This essay discusses the drawbacks of tourism for such countries followed by relevant examples. I agree that the disadvantages of the tourism should be handled prudently to lessen its adverse effects on a country.
Firstly, tourism activities can threaten the traditional culture of a country. Local people tend to imitate the cultures that are brought by the tourists from their home countries. Based on a cultural research conducted in Indonesia last year, local people stated that their traditional cultures are not suitable to the modern era, whereas the cultures brought by tourists to their country are more suitable and modern. For example, more local people like wearing modern clothes rather than traditional one as well as they follow more modern dances than the traditional one.
Secondly, tourism can cause the bad effect to the environment. Take littering cases as an example. It is irrefutable fact that so many tourists ignore the policy about rubbish. Bali as a tourism destination, besides getting awards because of the successful tourism, this city is well-known for the rubbish as well. The government face the difficulty in handling this littering problem because the increasing number of tourists each year. Then, the local people get the effect to their environment, such as land pollution, flood, and air pollution because of the waste.
On the other hand, tourism can increase the national government income from tourists' visa and local people get the work-field as well as the chance to learn other cultures. For instance, local people can build home stay area for tourist and gain income from that business. It can reduce the number of unemployment people and grow knowledge of local people about tourists' language.
Based on the previous explanation, we can conclude that tourism will be the threat for local cultures and environment, even though it is good for gaining income for government and local people as well as create a chance for local people to have job and knowledge.
Essay 449:
Most people in the world have a dream to live in an ideal society and lead a happy and meaningful life. However, they do not have the same idea about what the perfect society would look like. I personally think that there are three indicators that can measure the perfection of a society in the modern world: social value, proper infrastructure and employment opportunity. This essay discusses these factors and the ways to achieve that ideal society followed by the examples.
Firstly, social value and social bonding among people is the most important aspect of a perfect society. In a society where people have a strong bonding and obey the social norms tend to lead a better life. Society is formed with many families. If the family members are close and have a better relationship, they would form a better society. A perfect society must have people with human quality and good social behaviours.
Secondly, having good infrastructures and services can be one of the requirements of a perfect society. People need the infrastructures and public services to fulfil their necessity. Take people living in Melbourne as an example. Melbourne is claimed as a most livable city in the world and the people can be classified to live in a perfect society. This country has so many modern infrastructures, for example, modern public health centre, school, bus stop, and others as well as good services in the airport, local government office, etc. This ideal condition can be achieved if the people pay the tax regularly and obey the rules. The tax payment becomes a resource to build good and complete facilities for society. Furthermore, if the society obeys the regulation, they will not have problems with the services of people.
Thirdly, an ideal society needs sufficient job fields to work in. People can fulfil their needs by having a good salary from their work and have a good career in the future.  For example, people in Los Angeles spend most their time for working and have a good financial condition. This situation can be created by the society if people can be an entrepreneur. By being an entrepreneur, they can create new work fields for others and reduce the number of unemployed people.
In conclusion, a perfect society has to have good infrastructures and services as well as sufficient job vacancy. Then, this situation can be built by paying tax, obeying the policy, and creating the work-fields by entrepreneurs.
Essay 451:
With the advent of the computer and the widespread use of the internet, people have changed the way they perform everyday tasks. An increasing number of corporations believe in letting employees work full-time or part-time from home and thousands of people are doing freelancing to earn their livings. The following essay will discuss the pros and cons sides over this change.
A recent poll shows that people lose self-control and discipline easily while they perform professional work via telecommuting. Because people are given more freedoms to deal with the tasks and without a strict deadline, they often mixed their professional attitude with their personal life. They often lie to their employers and thus perform poorly.
On the contrary, imagine that there is no one looking over your shoulder and enforcing strict hours and because of that you may feel tempted to work endlessly. That can strongly influence your working effectively.  Therefore, there are other issues emerged that employees can't get along well with others since everyone just concentrating on their missions and it's easy to be overlooked.
Nevertheless, other people propose that the argument above is merely a one-sided story, by working at home you save on many hidden costs associated with going to work. These include costs of commuting, car purchasing, fuel costs, and parking spots as well. Moreover, flexible time and comfortable workplace provides employees more inspirations and creatively, since thinking out of the box is essential for those who work in advertising companies, IT firms and in other fields of works that require creativity. Without the stresses and strict monitoring from the office, working independently in their own preferred environment at their own pace, professionals are often a lot happier and a lot more productive.
In conclusion, it depends on companies current situations to consider whether to allow employees work from home or not. For my view, as a designer, I prefer to work from home since it gives me more inspirations and freedom.
Essay 453:
It is true that nowadays more men are looking after their children at home while more women have become responsible for the family’s financial aspects. There are many reasons for this, and I believe that it is a negative trend.
The main reason for this phenomenon is related to social factors. By this, I mean that the equality between male and female in the modern society has opened the door for more women to gain qualifications and to get good opportunities at work. For illustration, women who work as a nurse or a doctor receive a large sum of money compared to men who work in other fields. These reveals a structure change in gender roles in the family and at work. Another cause for more men to do housework is the economic crisis of present era. Financial problems inside the family force parents to going out and looking for a job to be able to cover the living cost.
In my opinion, this is completely contrary development. Firstly, in many cultures men are considered to be the breadwinner for the family and women should do the upbringing of children. Secondly, kids should stay longer with their mother; this is what is suggested by researchers in a recent study. They have approved that children who left their first five years for a long time deteriorated at school, later on, suffer mental stress than youngsters whose mothers stay at home to look after them.
Essay 454:
From my point of view, new discoveries cannot be limited; in particular, new innovative technological devices have increased and being developed every day. Transportation is one of the most important discoveries in the world and has made it possible to have a modern world. In my opinion train is the most significant innovation in the past 2 centuries in the transportation field.
Transportation has been a prominent part of humankind and the demand for new and more comfortable vehicles made people discover life-enhancing transportation innovations. Over the past 200 years, transportation has been reformed from ordinary trains to more complicated and developed magnetic trains. In my opinion, all vehicles such as cars, trains, airplanes or ships have their own importance for people. Consequently, cars are undoubtedly predominant in our daily life as these vehicles are comfortable and have adequate speed. Plains or ships comprise the majority in the transportation of loads. Furthermore, travelling to short-distanced places is more optimal by trains. So, those vehicles are specialised in particular areas.
From my perspective, the most remarkable transportation vehicle which is has specialised in its area is the train. In particular, fast trains of modern days. These trains have been discovered by Chinese engineers and are spreading around the world and are being utilised by many other countries. The advantage of these trains is that they are too fast. Also, it can be clearly understood from its name which is ‘fast train’. That train's speed makes it easier to travel between places without wasting time. And developers are trying to discover a new magnetic train which can travel faster in the future.
To sum up, humankind was always in search for new innovations and transportation discoveries have changed over the past 2 centuries and fast trains are the most significant innovations in my opinion.
Essay 455:
Decent employment is a necessity to lead a standard life for everyone. In the employment market, many people keep on various rules and cultures. The concept of a modern job has been on its transformation stage. Though many people express their opinion as it is better to start the job after school education, my two cents is the better employment opportunities turn up to the university graduation holders.
One obvious reason is that critical skilled jobs such as medicine and information technology call for excellent academic backgrounds. To be more precise vast scientific and technological understanding is necessary for the betterment of these atypical jobs. University educations cater to the needs of these job requirements. Needless to say, only university graduates bring in these kinds of job skills go by the theoretical and practical curriculum. Over and above, advanced educations facilitate to not only horn the pupil's skills but also enlighten them in many ways. Graduates from Harvard and Cambridge universities are the hot ticket in the contemporary job market is the best epitome.
Next, most of the countries public administration departments prefer to work with university graduates than school dropouts. In other words, graduation is the basic criterion for civil service jobs of most of the nations including the third world. It is a gospel truth that, well-informed people can easily break the deadlock of many public issues than others. It definitely helps to save money and resources of countries in many ways. So, the hand full of jobs with the handsome amount of money waiting for the university graduates around the world. Indian administrative service applicants’ basic qualification is mentioned as any graduation from the university is the best example.
On the other hand, an army of people argues that the early works starts get better experiences in job settings. Perhaps it may be true to some degree but, unskilled workers do not have much demand in the job market. They really need to pull their socks up to find a good employment opportunity in existing word.
Put it in a nutshell, the more training we achieved the less unemployed we are. The better employment opportunities are always for the well informed and university holders. A good education assures decent jobs in private and public work settings. So, practising this rule gives several folds positive result than just early starts work concept.
Essay 456:
We live in an advanced and globalised world which necessitates that all people must learn a foreign language to cope with the modern trend. The optimum age for learning a new language is a matter of public debate which in my opinion is better to start as early as possible as the advantages of it are far more than the disadvantages.
On one hand, the main disadvantages of teaching children another language at primary school are that - firstly, it could affect their ability to learn their mother tongue properly and they might get confused by learning many different languages with different grammar and pronunciation at the same time. Secondly, it could be a waste of their study time which could be spent on learning core subjects such as mathematics, sciences, technology etc. Finally, the learning of foreign language adds more loads on these young kids and takes some of their fun time.
On the other hand knowing a foreign language at a young age is easier and need less time than learning at an older age. The children could pick up the pronunciation more easily as they learn it sub-consciously. Also, they learn with no shy and talk freely without any fear of making mistakes. Moreover teaching young children foreign language has a positive impact on their personality as it broadens their horizon and improves their social skills in dealing with foreign people and exposing them a wide range of cultures. Furthermore they will benefit from knowing a foreign language in their upcoming studies and work career as well, and still, they could find learning new language enjoyable for example: use some games and illustration for them as a teaching method.
Essay 457:
Peace and prosperity are not bound to gender and in fact, they are connected to the qualities that leaders possess. Therefore, I contradict with the given idea that females are better to lead the world than males.
History tells us that males have been better leaders in term of their ruling style and devotion. To judge the state of peace, discrimination between genders is unjust as world’s history is flooded with examples where men leadership lessened chaos around the globe for example in the time of empire system. The given opinion totally has a conflict to what we have today. Countries with least rate of brutality, cruelty and violence such as Sweden and Switzerland are ruled by male governors. The United Kingdom is run by Queen which also has maintained a good prosperity within the state. Again, we have noticed considerable violence and corruptions under the female government in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh!
World’s peace is most injured by the negative use of nuclear technology, differences in religion, poverty and crime rates etc. If a leader gets good control of such conflicting issues, then regardless of gender, peace would prevail worldwide. Maintenance of peace is influenced by making effective foreign relation policies, eliminating poverty, strengthening funding for needy nations and avoiding war. These are real duties of a leader which men women both can do.
Hence, I totally disagree with the idea of relating peace to the gender of a leader. Both men and women should be given equal chances to lead the world. It is just a general rule to be followed that those who desire peace, deserve to be seated in authoritative positions.
Essay 458:
In the current world, most of the people like to celebrate any special occasion by inviting a lot of people. The discussion that throwing too much money to hold parties like birthday, marriage or any other special event is a debatable one, with strong logics provided by the supporters of both the views.
A few argue that the special events need to be celebrated grandly, as it happens only a few times in a lifetime. For instance, marriage is considered to occur once in a lifetime and the people want to have the memory of that event until their last breath. This is possible only when the location is well decorated and all of the friends and the neighbours are invited. By spending limited money, it is almost impossible to achieve something special which will be remembered forever. Thus it is obvious, why some people incline towards this point of view.
On the other hand, some people believe that it is not right to spend a huge amount money on personal celebrations as there are a lot of people across the globe under starvation. For example, in most of the African countries, many people do not even have food to eat for a single meal a day. In case, the money spent on celebration can be sent to the people who are really in need, definitely, a lot of life can be saved. Hence, it is clear why a few individuals refute with high spending parties.
Considering the memories of special occasions as well as starvation, spending much money for parties has been supported and refuted by many. Even though memories of some special events are important, saving human life from starvation is more important. Hence, in my opinion, it is necessary to cut down the spending on parties and spend that money for the poor people’s food.
Essay 459:
There has been tremendous growth of entertainment media over the last few years. Media influenced numerous people and it becomes an essential part of their life. Some people argue that media is spoiling youngster badly due to the severe violence that is being used on TV programmes and films. However, others state that it keeps us updated with the latest news and a source of entertainment for many. I strongly believe that media has undeniable benefits on people lives.
Media play a vital role in easing our stress and tension. Nowadays people are busy in their hectic routine work, they get very less time for recreational activities. Movies and television provide best sources of entertainment and help us to become refreshed and informed, relaxed and energetic for our future work. In addition to this television also provide news and other informative programs which create awareness and enhance our knowledge.
However, youngsters are negatively affected by the violence and aggression shown in movies and dramas. They have become less patience and more susceptible to violence. This has also increased the crime rate in the society. People want to act like their favourite celebrity in real life, which cause many problems. For Instance, people start fighting over a small dispute which could turn into a battlefield on a later stage. Fashion and style that youngsters often follow because of their favourite actor or actress are often unacceptable in many societies.
In conclusion, I believe that we should use media as a fun activity rather than highlight its negative aspects. It is also recommended to remove violence. Finally, movies and TV has more positive effects and should be the mandatory part of everyone lives.
Essay 461:
Money plays an imperative role in one’s life. However, some among the mass believe that it is the most significant than other important factors and aspects of life. A moot question pertaining to the use of money would be the meticulous ways to spend it and other factors attributing to one's quality of life? Let us discourse on this topic below.
As far as the right use of money is concerned, the golden rule would be to spend it wisely focusing on righteousness and virtues. Firstly, money should be spent on one's necessities compared to luxuries. It is ubiquitous nowadays for a mediocre family to own cars. This exemplifies the innate quest within the public to be extravagant. Secondly, money being spent on charity would classify the right use of it. From time immemorial, man has perceived himself as a social being, hence money spend on helping others would serve its ideal purpose. Thirdly, the monitoring efforts have been made to combat the threats to human existence on earth like terrorism, global warming etc. would be the next in line. Worldwide fundraisers to counter these menace exemplifies the right use of money.
Apart from money, factors are many that contribute to one's quality of life. A good life would mean social, emotional and physical well-being of an individual. An individual devoid of mental peace would be a backlog contender towards achieving the quality of life. Maintaining one's social and familial relationships in an enchanting manner would be ideal for quality life. Another indispensable factor in this context would be the success in life that one earned, both success and good life being directly proportional to each other. Last but not to the least, one's innate qualities like kindheartedness, love towards their counterparts, the way one thing all constitutes to achieving a better quality.
To conclude, I would like to reiterate that though money is eminent, when it comes to livelihood and quality of life, it would be dogmatic to assert that wealth is the most important than other factors involved in a healthy living. Along with the other determiners and rightly spend money, life is beautiful!
Essay 463:
Life has become more stressful than ever. People seems like cannot find a successful path due to stress related problem. Mentally disturbed one have problems in each and every step of the life. In my opinion, people should have stress but not across the inordinate level of stress in day to day life. Higher competition, higher expenses, limited resources, more expectation and globalizations are the main reasons for this increased stress in our life. Having realistic ambitions in life, living a positive life, better family bonding and being honest and contended are the main ways of overcoming this problem.   
I believe that higher competition in every step of life is the most common reason for our stress. I believed that the stress has taken place into our mind due to the lack of our self-confidence. Main reason behind the stress is to not having a clear vision towards foreseeable future. Many people could not anticipate their aim and objectives in life. Mostly people who are always jumbling for their destinations tend to face stress in day to day activities. A person in stress neither gets an opportunity in life nor live the life happily. People in stress just waste their time for blaming others for their problem. Higher living expenses force people to work more and that has reached to over 10-14 hours in many professions. Limited resources and the higher population have made it impossible to have a decent life without competing. This is another reason people nowadays face more job-related stress than ever before. Many people are not contented with whatever they have and they are always in stress. Globalisation has opened the doors of new possibility and along with it new expectations. This is another reason that can be contributed to the stress. The environment pollution and junk food that we usually eat reduced our level of fitness and physical illness and mental stress are correlated.
Again, frustration and depression are the reasons for mental stress for people and drug abuse, family issues and social perspectives could be attributed to these. Stress decreases the efficiency of people on job. People with such pressure also fail to manage good relationship within home and outside. Such people cannot become happy as well as people around him are also affected.
There are many steps that the individuals and the society can take to make our life stress free. First of all, we have to learn to be contented and satisfied. Without being self-contented no one can ever overcome this problem. Proper planning, punctuality and better family bonding can solve this problem to some extent. We should live our life in a decent way and should always be honest not to question our own honesty and integrity. As far as I am concerned, sometimes, I have suffered for my career growth stress. But I did not cross the inordinate level of stress. I immediately concentrate towards the situation and find the problem myself and I try my best to come out from stress by making a proper plan and solve the problem as soon as possible.
Again, the cumulative effort to be happy and contended by each family member can contribute to a great deal. We should keep our body fit and do exercise daily. It is medically proven that proper exercise helps us reduce our stress. We should pick up hobbies, travel new places and read frequently to remove our stress. We also can travel to naturally beautiful places to reduce stresses of our mind. Travelling creates an opportunity to encounter with new circumstances and help to refresh our mind.
In my opinion, to come out from stress people have to identify the reason of stress and have to start working hard to resolve the problems immediately. If we cannot take immediate actions for our problems and stress, that might create a hazardous situation in foreseeable future.
Life is faster-paced today than the past and people are forced to work harder and for long hours to save their jobs. The professional and social competitions have skyrocketed and so has the stress-related issues. Our attitude, high competition everywhere and the very job nature demands more of us and as a result, we are suffering from stress-related illness. Our attitude towards our life and self-contentment could be the answer to this problem.
Ever changing and challenging job environment, rat-race in the job market, frequent deadlines, lengthy working hours, monthly targets and frequent meetings put us on our toes. We are in constant fear that the employer would pick someone else and we would not be promoted unless we excel in our jobs. Furthermore, technology changes rapidly and that makes the existing skill sets become obsolete and forces people to take more pressure to learn the new technologies. Income and job-related uncertainties are two major pressures on professionals and ambitious and achievement oriented people thus suffer from stress-related issues.
Besides, the ever increasing population in the city put more pressures on our immediate environment and resources. As resources become scarce, they also become more expensive which adds more pressure on the already struggling citizens. The growing intricacies of the modern world are compounded by the change of lifestyle and our expectation that pervades all aspects of our life and thus making our life more complex. If we do not know where to stop and when to relax, we will never be able to appreciate the beauty of life and come out from the stress-related problems.
To solve this problem, we have to change our attitude towards the life. Life is not about running after money and promotion and once in a while, we have to take breaks. If we know what creates our stress and start living a healthy life as much as possible, we would have a better lifestyle. From the employers' end, there should be some initiatives for reducing the stress at workplace. Moreover, spending quality time with the family members and with people, we care about is another good way to fight stress. Above all, we have to learn to lead a contented life with whatever we have. This is the mantra of a stress-free life.
In conclusion, we have got only one life and if we let the modern world intricacies eat it up, we would be the greatest fool in the history. We need to be happy with little and lead quality time with family members to fight the stress-related issues that we acquire due to the competitive and demanding job environment.
Essay 465:
Undoubtedly, parents can teach their children more efficiently than the others because both of them know their children very well and have a greater bond with the kids.  While the lessons learnt from our teachers, friends and our own experiences are very important; none can exceed the parents as teachers. This essay intends to assess this statement in depth as follows.
Parents get sufficient amount of time to spend with their children rather than teachers. During this time, they teach each and everything about the world as well as academic subjects as much as they can. Moreover, they clarify the doubts of children in various aspects which are the required quality of an excellent teacher. Such activities help children to increase their wider knowledge considerably.
Secondly, parents know their children from the earliest stage of life. Therefore, they can easily evaluate both strong and weak areas of their own children. This helps parents significantly to guide their children to overcome their weakness which is the important responsibility of an ideal teacher. Furthermore, in this way, parents can also motivate their children to learn more lessons which are very useful for their bright future. For all these reasons, I can say that parents can be perfect teachers without any doubt.
However, there are those who believe that all parents cannot teach their children due to their poor knowledge, lack of social skills and so on. They also contend that only certain parents can become the best teachers for their children. Nevertheless, I think that parents can give many moral lessons to their children in spite of poor academic qualifications.
In conclusion, although all parents cannot perform as good teachers in academic areas, they can teach all other lessons from their life experience which are also crucial for the future life of the young generation.
Essay 467:
From my viewpoint, young people are influenced by the grown-up people's behaviour in many cases. They also mimic their favourite actors, singers, sportspersons and that is why professional sportsmen or sportswomen have to pay more attention to their attitudes and they should be aware of how they affect youth's lives.
Athletes are the people who are being observed by many people from all over the world and this popularity means responsibility. Consequently what I meant with responsibility is how sports people behave in their daily life. In one hand, engaging with sport might even make every man or women stronger and healthier. Namely, youth who are watching sport will be encouraged by athletes' health and also the lifestyle. Furthermore, they will become more eager to being athletes.
On the other hand, despite these athletes who have undeniably good lifestyle and health, undoubtedly there are also sports people who have a vast popularity but haven't got a bit of ethic. In spite of their bulk money, they waste the money whimsically. But they don't choose to do a charity instead. So it is evident that these people's lifestyle cannot be a prime example for youth. Thus professional athletes should not neglect their daily life and must take their role on youth into account.
Again, the way they appear in front of media, they fashion trends that follow and the way they speak or behave are often mimicked by people. They are already role models for many and they can positively influence others, especially the young generation. A new hairstyle by David Beckham would definitely become a fashion trend among many youngsters. They can definitely become the role model of many young people especially who have passions for sports. The good example the sports persons set through personal life, appearance, charity works can create a very positive image to others and thus they have a greater influence on the young generation.  
To sum up, in spite of the youth can be easily manipulated by other people, the professional athletes through their works and behaviours can set positive examples and can become role models for the young generation.
Essay 468:
Undoubtedly, food is the basic requirement of all human beings. Since people nowadays make different kinds of foods very easily, it greatly influences people’s life positively due to various reasons as follows.
To begin with, unlike in the past, easier methods of cooking save a considerable amount of time and energy of people which they utilize efficiently for their individual and professional sectors to achieve goals. In this way, people’s life standard has developed to a great extent. For example, according to the research of Indian Employment Sector in India in 2014, there was a remarkable increase in the number of women workers compared to previous years due to decreased household works mainly cooking.
Moreover, people’s health status has improved. To explain, in the past, people often avoided cooking in their own homes due to their busy life. But now situation has changed as anyone can prepare food easily without any training. This trend has enabled them to make homely and healthy food instead of having fast foods from restaurants. For instance, youngsters and even children make healthy and tasty foods as they like with the help of advanced home appliances easily. These activities make enable youth people more confident and independent to cook food rather than approaching parents or elders. In all these ways people’s lifestyle developed remarkably.
In conclusion, the way of cooking has a significant role in individual life directly or indirectly. So in this modern era, people are always following easy preparation methods of cooking for the enhancement of present lifestyle.
Essay 470:
The invention of the computer is referred to as an epic among the other technological breakthroughs of last century. The role of computers in today’s lifestyle has reached such dizzy heights than anyone could ever imagine. Righteously, its use in various fields of medicine, crime investigation and even aerospace engineering is explicit. In the midst of a computer-driven world, its future purposes are infinite. The affinity that human has developed for this technological gizmo is mammoth, and this dependency, for many is moot.
In the present scenario, majority of the fields, mankind thrives on are revolutionised by computers. Its significance in the medical field, for instance, is quite imperative. For example, from the safeguarding of patient medical records to the automated and meticulous interpretation of investigation reports, are computerised. The role of computers in crime investigation is rather inevitable nowadays. Global satellite tracking on personal gadgets of criminals to chase them down would exemplify this. Another significant technological impact computers made is in aero-spacing, where, even flying an aircraft has become computerised, dubious whether Charles Babbage envisaged the same?
The future use of computers by the humankind is endless. To name or pinpoint on its future prospectives, would be cumbersome or rather impossible. Some believe that in near future, computers will serve the purpose of being the 'first hand 'of help to humans. A globalised world under the umbrella of the computer revolution is not farsighted as before. The very existence computer operated human robots that could even replace a human, is not a myth anymore.
Now having discoursed, about the computer revolution and its effects on mankind, a question of one getting dependent on computers is impeccable. In this globalised world, computer addiction is a major concern unattended. Children spending long hours on computers and its misuse in workplaces by employees is ubiquitous and a generally accorded bane.
Essay 471:
In the midst of globalisation and industrialisation, the amount of waste being exhaled, detrimental to our planet earth, is appalling. Reasons are aplenty, as to why this is a frequent occurrence and the imperative role of government worldwide over in countering this, is a moot one. Let us discourse on the same below.
There are many reasons behind the increase in the production of rubbish throughout the world. Firstly, the ever increase of population of the humankind has contributed to a mammoth share of the trash. The number of people has always been directly proportional to the volume of waste being produced from the time immemorial. Secondly, the industrial revolution, that shook the world a decade ago, is considered the sole culprit in the production of industrious waste onto earth’s surface. Again the number of industries and factories contributing to this menace is on a steep climb, since its inception.
Thirdly, the population rise has led to more transport system around the world, owing to an increase in the waste produced from the vehicles and other means of transport. To cite an example from the part of the world I live, the discarded parts of cars, such as a blotted tire, is ubiquitous, compared to the past. Finally, the sheer negligence from us, with regards to the recycling of waste products has led to adding more chaos to the present scenario. No care, what so ever, was taken in the production of biodegradable products, so as to mitigate the amount of trash produced!
The role of government in combating the issue is inevitable. They should be imposing restrictions on the above-discoursed factors, favouring waste segregation. Population check, of governments on their respective states, should be made mandatory. The industries and factories should be restricted and monitored for the effective recycling or biodegradation of their waste produced. The amenities used by mankind, such as transport should be made more efficient and effective in terms of discarded residual waste. Building eco-friendly homes should be encouraged.  More emphasis should be made on the recycling of all the industrial trash being produced o an emergency basis. The government should focus more on the fact that these are either biodegradable or can be recycled effectively.
From the above discourse, someone's role as civilians of earth and that of government is quite interdependent and significant, when comes to reducing the amount of waste being produced.  Punitive measures from the government are the needs of the hour, to tackle this issue, so as to ensure rather envisage, a cleaner and habitable planet earth.
Rubbish simply refers to waste production, which is a severe issue for the whole world due to recent environmental degradations, pollution and global warming. The reason behind the increasing garbage production and some measures to improve the overall situation will be discussed in this essay.
There are a couple of reasons, in my mind, behind the increase in waste production in recent years. First, the uncontrollable use of non-decomposable carriers (eg. plastics and polythene) is one of the top-most causes of excessive waste production. Plastics is a bigger concern and it is being preferred more than ever for packaging or bottling certain products, especially in the food and beverage industries. Besides, the incognizance of citizen is playing its part undoubtedly. We are being used to a throwaway culture rather than using recycling products. This is leading to the preferences of companies to produce one-time products which are eventually increasing more and more waste production.
To reduce waste production and to save the environment, governments in all countries have to play a bigger role than they are actually playing. The government should legislate strict laws to enforce companies to use decomposable packaging materials. Assistance from the judicial system can be a good move. For example, the mobile courts led by licensed magistrates can fine those whoever does not comply with the law. The government should also encourage people and manufacturers to take part in recycling and reusing products whenever applicable. Restaurants and fast-food shops should offer a discount on food and drink items when customers return the packaging bottles or packets that were made of plastics. Such kinds of initiatives should be appreciated by authority.
In conclusion, the government, as well as the manufacturers, need to be more focused on the consequence of massive waste production, therefore stepping forward to apply possible measures can reduce the growing concern.
Essay 473:
Many people choose to go to college or university and there are a variety of reasons why they choose to do so. For instance, some may prefer further studies to gain educational qualifications required for a competent workplace and high career prospects; meanwhile, a few others might choose to pursue their studies to gain new experiences compared to the very structured form of education experienced in high school. On the other hand, pursuing higher studies seem as the only choice or as the next step that is assumed to be taken.
Considering the first reason into consideration, higher studies are indeed required to secure a high paid and reputable designation at a workplace. This is because many employers set competitive recruitment standards to hire the most qualified and suitable candidate for the vacancy. As a result, applicants need not only extensive work experience but also the educational requirements that can enhance working knowledge.
Moving onto the second choice as to why people tend to go to college or university is as mentioned before, to gain new experience since high schools set a very structured study environment. This is at least true considering high schools in Sri Lanka where a fixed syllabus is supposed to be followed and any other additional topics or subjects not included in the syllabus will not be taught or considered. Therefore, students are forced to study only what is taught. However, life in college or university is very different as the individual is given more freedom to research on other areas of interest and have the space to be more creative.
On the contrary, once again taking the Sri Lankan culture into consideration, most individuals are convinced by parents to pursue higher studies as it sets them apart from individuals who start work immediately upon completing high school. Therefore, pursuing higher studies is indeed a prestige and a privilege as not all students have the ability or opportunity to do so. As a result, attending college or university can sometimes not be exclusively the individual’s choice but merely an obligation that is meant to be met in order to satisfy parental standards or requirements.
In conclusion, my personal opinions are as mentioned above but there are numerous other reasons as to why someone would want to go to college or university and may vary from one individual to another. However, though the reasons tend to differ, it is always admirable that many people choose to pursue higher studies than discontinuing studies after high school.
Essay 474:
It is true that educational institutions such as colleges and universities help people to achieve new experiences, higher knowledge and for career preparation. From my point of view, people must go to colleges or universities due to various reasons as follows.
To begin with, this is the biggest opportunity for students to expose their talents in front of a large number of people. To be clear, after their school education with a limited audience, this is the next level. They get more exposure in front of a massive crowd. These experiences boost the person to develop his skills further. Moreover, such talented students can promote many beneficial activities for the welfare of the society. To explain, most of the people are easily being influenced by creative people. For example, nowadays, government depends on the creative artists to conduct awareness campaigns for the betterment of the society. As a result, people get useful information along with entertainment which enhances the overall development of the society.
Furthermore, universities and colleges improve social skills to a great extent. These institutions give a lot of chances for people to interact with different kinds of people from various levels of social sectors. Therefore, communication skill can be increased efficiently which help for social interaction among members. These interactions make enable the person more productive for the country. For all these reasons, I strongly believe that people should attend colleges or universities without any doubt.
In conclusion, educational institutions always support and encourage people to do positive things for themselves as well as for their country. So, all people have to complete their university degree or college education to have a better career and better contribution towards the society.
Essay 475:
Students attend formal educational institutes for many different factors. I personally believe that knowledge has multiple dimensional impacts in personality making. Higher education centres help the people in learning of knowledge, skill, communication, competitive lifestyle, grooming, personality making and building of confidence and career. Some people join them for the sake of getting degrees only.
A few decades ago people were not well averred about a variety of education and about the outcome of certain degree and skill. Nowadays the trend has increased for youth in attending universities and colleges. Huge proportions of people plan their career and then get their education accordingly.  Some students opt to these institutes for the sake of professional education. Doctors, engineers, financial consultant learn knowledge, skill, implementation of knowledge and also get degree and licence to practice from these organisations. These institutes provide competitive environments that make them more polished and skilled. Some students get indulged into politics and after their education, they choose politics as their career.
Although most of the students join these institutes in very purposeful manner but some people join them unplanned. Children of elite class join these education centres for the sake of fun only. Few female students complete their education very successfully and after completing their studies they like to get married and keep on staying at their home.
Just for the sake of comparison if we analyse people who got their education from universities and colleges with those who got these degrees by studying distant education resources, we will get amazing differences. Students from many prestigious institutions will be better groomed, professional and hard working as compared to others.
In short colleges and universities improve the human personality from many angles.  They award degrees and try to make the wonderful citizens also. To summarise, higher education centres are mandatory in building a Nation.
Essay 476:
People have different views on whether a government should support the elderly and retired people financially or not. I believe that it is mostly an individual’s responsibility to save money for their retirement but I totally disagree that elderly people shouldn't receive any support from the state. The combination of personal support and the government’s support could be the best possible solution for the retired elderly people.
I think the government should support the elderly people financially as this is the part of a social democracy which states the equality of opportunities and distribution of resources fairly. For example, many developed countries like Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United State are following this strategy by allowing some money to be cashed for elderly people upon their retirement. Moreover, it is their right to have some financial support as they had paid their taxes throughout their lives. So they have to take some of their money back when they need it. The government should allocate money to take care of its citizens no matter what are their ages.
On the other side, those elderly people do not have any alternative way of earning, as their chances for employment is quite low in contrast to the young people, they should be taken care by the savings they have, by their own children and by the government. 
The people should always have savings and relatives who would be taking care of them when they become old. The parents take care of their kids and sacrifice a lot. The children should always be ready to take care of their elder parents. A prudent person would have some savings for his old years and thus it is also an individual’s responsibility to save for their future need. Furthermore, the government can’t deny its role to take care of the elder people. The combination of these three can be very effective to take care of people when they become old.
In conclusion, governments should take the responsibility of providing senior citizens with all their financial needs as part of  ensuring their well-being and at the same time it is an individual's responsibility to save money for their hardest time  and their sons and daughters have some responsibilities as well.
Essay 478:
In order to cultivate children's intellectual development, a growing number of parents spend money on purchasing different toys for their children. According to an official survey, children's educational toys can allow their cognitive development to be effective and faster. The following paragraphs are going to discuss the pros and cons for children having lots of playthings or toys.
Apparently, providing a wider range of toys to children to play with can benefit their psychological developments. The best toys engage a child's senses, spark their imaginations and encourage them to interact with others. For example, Lego blocks can help preschoolers to learn letters, numbers and languages skills. Moreover, it can improve their communication skill as well when they play with other kids. As everyone knows, communication plays an essential role in our life and the toys can help them have playmates with whom they communicate a lot. Finally, some toys are made for children's educational purposes. For example, blocks, educational computer games, puzzles etc. ignite the creativity of children and let them find out their interests.
Nevertheless, other people propose that the argument above is merely a one sided story as children having too many playthings become greedy. For instance, many parents spoil their children by purchasing every toy the children want. Afterwards, those children will have a strong desire to acquire more toys. Moreover, those toys need a plenty of money and wasting is an evil act. Furthermore, too many toys may grow a conformist mentality in a child as they are immature to distinguish the good from the bad and they just follow other children's playing style, activity and characters. Finally, if a child gets every toy he wants, he will not value most of the toys and lose his interests on a toy and would like to have a new toy. Thus the true need of toys is misused by purchasing a lot of toys to the children.
In conclusion, toys play an important role in helping a child's growth but too many toys affect children's psychological development negatively. Thus parents should lead them in a proper way and purchase a reasonable number of toys that they would feel right for their children.
Essay 480:
During first few years of life, children are greatly influenced by their surroundings, attitude or parents and things they play with. During development ages for a child, his/her mental capabilities and physical growth relies on the way s/he utilises it. In my opinion, sports related gifts will be important for children as they would help them to grow their interest in sports and that might bring out potential talents they might have on sports. In terms of relation building, gifts are always helpful.
Before taking the decision to present something to children, one must consider the age, liking and disliking, health hazards, durability and cost of a gift. Children love to play physical sports and enjoy the taste of contact with their beloved ones. By playing football kids will get their muscles developed. It will increase their stamina for walking and running. By playing with children of same age group, they will get these sweet memories imprinted in their mind. From these senses, giving sports materials to kids has many benefits. Similarly, kids like to explore new things and thus grow their interest. A gift like a camera might bring out a potential photographer for the future.
Sometimes wrong choices of gifts can cause physical injuries and in some other cases, kids might not use it due to lack of interest in that particular object. Few people present very costly stuff to the growing age group and they don’t appreciate these valuables, simply they misuse it and there will be a waste of money.
Giving a small bird or a pet would help them to get close to them and thus it would help them to develop a better understanding of the world and other creatures. Sometimes they require taking care of their pets and they learn this great quality of life. Personally, I would like to give a pet to a child as it would help them in many ways including knowing about this species, getting closer to that pet, taking care of it, and exploring many new activities that would help them better develop as a human.
In short, every incidence, contact and story produce some impacts on the personality of a growing child. So the choice of gifts must be very meticulous and useful. Sports item are by and large harmless and produce positive effects in human development while a pet as a gift can help them explore new things and learn how to take care of others.
Essay 481:
It is a big concern for many people that it is not a compulsory responsibility of their government to provide international aid to other countries owing to the fact that they have some obstacles in their home country. In my opinion, I would like to stay in middle ground of this debate.
Firstly, one important aspect of a government is to invest money in their own country instead of giving wealth to other countries. In fact, it is true that when the unemployment rate is high in a country and people of this country need better economic structure, they would not support that their governments supply aid and money to other poor countries. Naturally, they would expect their own problems to be sorted out first. For instance, if any government invests money for the constructions of many new organisations like factories and health departments in their homeland, there will be more chances of development of country and high opportunities to control on unemployment.
Another important thing for any country’s government is to provide homes and some other facilities to homeless people rather than lending money to other countries because in this way the economy would be better than before in that country. If any government has extra money firstly they should focus on compulsory needs of their own country after that it can be provided as the international aid to other countries.
However, we live in a single globe and when people in some parts of the world are starving, many others have opulent resources. Sharing among nations can ensure a better world. The economic structure of the present world would never allow a country to ensure 100% employment and houses for people to live in. there will always be homeless people and jobless youth even in developed countries. So considering these, a rich nation should always help the poor nations in need. Don’t we help people with our resources and money when we still have a scarcity of these? Similarly, a comparatively rich country should always raise the helping hand to the poor nations. The sharing of wealth will eliminate more pressing problems in poor nations and thus in return they would also help in other ways. For example, rich countries like the USA invest in research facilities in many Asian countries and in return they can have meritorious scientists living and working for them and better business understanding.
In conclusion, the government of a country should first fulfil the necessity of its own citizens. To a certain extent, they should share their extra wealth to poor countries as the international aid that can be helpful for both of the countries.
Essay 483:
Nowadays, there has been a positive trend that sport has gained popularity in society. However, others think that sport is just a leisure activity. In my perspective, both views have credibility which I will elaborate in this essay.
First of all, it is an undeniable fact that there are some reasons why sports is essential to the society. One of the reasons is that people can become healthier than ever before. By playing sports frequently, people can release toxic elements from off their body in order to help the government to save money which is allocated for health insurance's residents. For example, the number of obesity and heart attack, today, has decreased significantly throughout the world because of sports implementation.
Another reason is that young generations are able to cultivate a good habit. With the rapid advancement of technology, they tend to do sedentary activities such as playing computer games and chatting through social media as well. If parents encourage their children to do sport instead of playing games at home, children can improve their social interaction with peers. However, there are opposing arguments saying that sport is nothing more than a leisure activity. It is true that sport can be counted as a leisure activity because not everyone has the abilities and potentials to become professional sports players. Therefore, people generally consider it as a simple activity for relaxing their mind and body during holidays. Apart from this, many families see sport as the way to strengthen the sense of belonging to the relatives especially for children because parents' time is spent more to do job tasks and put less care on them.
All things considered, although some people believe that sports are merely some leisure activities, I still think that sport plays an important role in the society because it has brought advantages to people in terms of health and social areas.
Essay 484:
It is certainly true that child rising is considered to be a crucial work of every woman. Although I accept that few women are still need of government’s support, I believe not all women expect this.
Gone are those days, when women were typical homemakers or mothers. The roles of women have changed inside today’s contemporary families. In fact, the women are becoming the breadwinners of the family and men are taking up the role of house husbands. So how is this possible for a mother to become wholly responsible for children’s upbringing! Educated women of this modern world share their responsibilities with their life partners and are also focusing on financial issues, career, savings etc other than the usual household chores and taking care of their children. It is believed that child’s behaviour nowadays is shaped by the schools and the society. So the parents just look after that their ward is getting educated in a good institution. In this way, the child grows more independently and successfully. Therefore, it is practically not possible for women these days to spend more time in child raising.
However, there are still women who are in dire need of government’s support. In some rural areas which are not developed, women still take up only the role of mothers. They may not be well educated and therefore cannot support themselves. The situation would be worse if she is divorced or a widow. In this case, women should be supported financially. For instance, Pettavaithalai village near Trichy city in India receives a funding to support all the mothers with Rs 10,000 monthly. Consequently, the women and her children are now developing and becoming successful. Thus, few women should be supported by the government.
In conclusion, while I accept  that in few areas of the world women still lives on the darker side and should be helped, I believe that the revolutionised world has changed the role of most women and they do not depend on government’s support.
Essay 486:
It is certainly true that we prefer to watch television rather than getting along with our family or meeting people. Though I agree that it is not a positive impact, I believe it does not completely ruin any one's family life or society.
On the one hand, the idiot box is considered to be a dangerous tool which has a significant impact on both individuals and society. With regard to individuals, they get addicted to the programs telecasted and give low priority to the members of their family. Most Indian ladies who regularly watch mega serials have proven to have poor bonding with their family. At the same time, unknowingly it consumes more time than we expect. Consequently, we realise that we could have spent quality time with family or friends only at the later stage. Since everyone becomes a couch potato, there is less interaction with the neighbours and thus resulting in a community which is not really socially interactive.
On the other hand, television is not the only cause for problems in family and community. It is a well-known fact that internet access and other electronic gadgets like mobile phones, computers and laptops contribute to a great extent. Therefore, there becomes less necessity for people to communicate directly with the advent of group chats, video calls, free messaging and instant reply. Moreover, hectic work schedule drives more people towards entertainment to unwind themselves and re-energize for the next day. This does not cause any disturbance in a family if its usage is kept under the limit and all other relationships are prioritised. In fact, many programs like 'family no 1 ' are being broadcast to insist the family values and mutual understanding .This is not all there are several events of social concern being exposed to public to create awareness. Thus television cannot be blamed entirely as it has its own benefits.
To conclude, the entertainment motto of television is appealed more and it is common to devote time for relaxation .This is not all our working hours have changed these days and by that time  we would not have any one's company other than television. In my opinion, it would no way affect the relationship and socialisation if it is properly used in proper time.
Essay 488:
Recently, the number of people who purchase various products and services online is increasing more than ever before. This has certainly affected the business of shopping centres to a great extent. However, I consider this development as positive, due to a number of reasons.
To begin with, e-shopping is generally considered to be more convenient for customers than in-store purchasing. Perhaps, this is because, many people, nowadays, are unable to find adequate time to go shopping as they are too busy with professional or personal responsibilities. For example, virtual shopping websites such as, eBay and Amazon provide a wide range of products online, which cater to the needs of individuals from the comfort of their home. Moreover, such shopping sites have considerably reduced major inconveniences associated with shopping, like travelling to distant shops, parking vehicles in crowded cities and spending a considerable amount of time.
Furthermore, online shopping allows people to select from a wide range of products, and the prices and features of products are often compared. This has enabled customers to choose the right products that suit their needs. For instance, popular online shops in India, namely Flipkart and Jabong have not only provided detailed information of their products on sale but also customers' opinions and reviews on their product experience. Besides, placed orders on these websites can be altered or cancelled by customers, and purchased products can also be returned if they do not meet the assured quality.
Shopping, however, is a social experience for certain people and many of them enjoy shopping as leisure or entertainment. But, popular shopping websites often compete with stores with lower prices and discount sales. This has also influenced many people to purchase products online.
In conclusion, online shopping offers greater benefits to customers when compared to in-store purchasing. Clearly, while it converts shopping into a hassle-free experience, shopping over the internet is increasingly convenient, too. Therefore, I think this is definitely a positive trend and the popularity of online shopping is likely to continue.
Essay 490:
Education is highly essential these days. Parents give their best effort to make sure that their children get the highest quality of education. However, some challenges come up in pursuit this goal. One of these biggest problems is the less of students’ awareness and attentiveness in learning.
Students in many cases usually take part in education by force from parents and society. In other words, students are unaware of the learning process that they have been doing. It is believed, they just want to make people around them proud or pleased. In fact, they pretend to like and enjoy these learning activities even though they do not like that much to study.
Meanwhile, the improvement of education system serves several kinds of solutions. Particularly varying methods that are used in school or classroom can inspire kids to pay attention and enjoy their lessons. Education stockholders use different styles of teaching to combine with students’ preference. Indeed, children should feel enthusiastic and keep learning continually.
In addition, the next way out of this matter is children need a role model to show the real benefits of education. It is thought that children will figure out based on the example that to become a successful person; that means they have to study hard and vice versa.  Moreover, the environment of children where they grow up also have a big influence. It means that the place where children are living can improve what they are doing.
Learning should be fun, at least to the children. The computer based and games based education systems that are adopted in many modern schools could be an effective way to engage the student in enjoying the learning. Learning through experience, fund and sports are the best ways to attract kids to study more. Parents and teachers have to handle the whole learning process delicately to make the students enjoy the reading. Finally, children’s psychology can vary based on their inherent characteristics, family and economic conditions of their parents and that’s why teachers should pay special attentions to each student and act accordingly to grab their attentions and focus on study.  
In brief, being motivated students could reach closer to their dream. Many ways can lead to better education. A varying and suitable technique, portraying role model and getting support from the environment are pathways to be friendly with the study. 
Essay 491:
It is often considered by many that the usages of mobile phones in public places should be restricted as smoking has been. I completely agree with the banning of mobile phones in public places, especially where people are working and might get annoyed and interrupted.
Using mobile phones in public places causes several drawbacks, Firstly, it leads to various social problems. In other words, the use of mobile phones in public places causes serious offence. For example, recent researches showed that use of mobile phones while pedestrian crossing is the major cause of accidents in both developing and developed nations. Secondly, the lack of social interaction among individuals could be the consequence of mobile phones over usage in the public places. For instance, people travelling on the same bus become isolated and busy by surfing the internet on the mobile phones which lead to the lackings of communication among travellers.
In addition, there would be a scarcity of enjoyment in sightseeing while travelling. Take an example, if a person travelling by train through the countryside, the use of mobile phone makes them forget enjoy the fascinating places outside the compartment. Finally, talking loudly through mobile phones in public places such as church, mosque result in irritation, distress and disturbance to other individuals as mobile phones could be intrusive.
Essay 492:
The internet is considered to be the boon for the people of the technical era. Since it facilitates them in all fields such as banking, business promotion, entertainment, travel ticket bookings, communications etc. and has been making their work much easier, people are depending on this technology heavily. The most important benefit reaped out of the advent of the internet is the easy way of communication, argues many, like the business people, academicians, students but the counter-arguers emphasise that it is because of this invention the communication skill is gradually waning. However, in my opinion, if this tool is used effectively it could be more beneficial to the society.
With regard to the people who support the opinion that the World Wide Web is the best method to communicate with others, there are several arguments to put forth. Firstly, e-mail has  been serving  as a  fast and effective  way  to  send  messages and get a quick  reply when compared  to the earlier  postal services. It not only helps in exchange of information but also in more academic works, for instance in conducting webinars. This is where experts from various countries can join in a discussion about a research topic by using the application software like Google hangout. This is not all, personal communication, for individuals staying abroad to get in touch with their family, made facile by the use of Skype. So this way interest aids communication between people.
Contrarily, according to people who incline to the opinion that it destroys the communication skill, there are few viewpoints. Instead, they would enjoy staying alone with their electronic gadgets which have internet access. This aptly suits for the children who now prefer to stay online and chat which friends as opposed to going out and making friends. So if this scenario persists then they would gradually lose their communication skills, argue the supporters of this point of view.
To conclude, the internet is the best way of communication as it saves time to a great extent. So if the usage is restricted   to a particular time for children then the negative issue creeping out of this invention could be kerbed. Consequently, the whole society could acquire the advantages of using the internet to communicate.
Essay 494:
Drug addiction has become a serious problem in our society. It has spoiled dreams and aspirations of thousands of families. The fascinating story of the addicts is that once they accustomed to heinous habit, they cannot get rid of it regardless how they endeavour themselves. Especially, youth are used to drug abuse in my society. So, it is crucial to find the reasons behind their deadly habits. Very thoughtful decisions should be taken to help the youngsters to fight the drug abusing problems.
The first and foremost reason of this problem is the peer- pressure. As young people hangs out most time with dearer and nearer pals and some may be drug abusers, who compel their chaps to do drugs. Secondly, we can see advertisements, films that show using drugs in a seductive manner. The young have the habit of imitating whatever their best actor do, they no longer keep away themselves doing drugs. In long run, this little curiosity guides them to notorious drug abusers. Thirdly, young people have the attitudes of trying different things in their adolescents. As life is not a bed of roses, they may take drugs to forget all their worries. Family problem, psychological problem and bad influences of friends can be very lethal sometimes as they are sometimes the root causes for young people to try drugs.
Doing drug spoils the peace and harmony of the family. The druggist son steals cash and kinds to purchase drugs. Later, the family is engulfed in debt.  Another effect of the drug is it may take the life of drug abusers as they hardly give up evil and anti-social habit. If drug abusers exchange the needle among friends, they are vulnerable to transmission of deadly disease like AIDS. In a society where young people abuse drugs, naturally, the crime rates would be high there. More fights and murders could be observed in such areas and there must be personal, social and generation related problems related to widespread drug abusing.  Only a single drug abuser in a family can ruin the whole family and thus a generation declined to drug abusing would bring heinous problems to the country.
To wipe out drug from society educational programmes should be organised in school, colleges. Rehabilitation centres must be established to assess druggists. Advertisement of drugs, alcohol should be banned from the TV. Families should keep an eye on the bad companies their teenagers are spending time with and finally the family bonding and understanding should be strong enough to discourage the teenagers not to do something that would bring shame for the family. Governments must ensure that their law enforcing organisations are working hard to wipe out the illegal drug businesses from the country and strict laws should be imposed and implemented to punish the illegal drug business people.         
To recapitulate, drug abusers are evil of family, society and nation. The responsible bureaucrats and government must crack down on drugs to utilise young blood for the progress of a nation.                                
Essay 495:
It is true that we should hate crimes, not the criminals as they are also the human being. Evidence shows that good individuals are forced to commit a crime and are convicted and many ex-prisoners become normal members of our society. Since they have suffered from the isolation and punishment, they can share their experience with teenagers and encourage them to abide by the laws and rules.
To begin with, rehabilitated offenders have experience about the prison life and the types of wrongdoing people get involved in. They can share those experience with the teenagers and young people are more likely to accept advice from someone who speaks from real life experience. This can be a great arrangement to let the adolescents know how someone gets involved in a crime and how they suffer for this. It would discourage them from committing crimes and become good citizens. I presume those teenagers will have many questions and the ex-prisoners are the best persons to answer those and this will have a powerful impact on the fresh minds.
Moreover, people who have been punished by the law would benefit from this arrangement as well. They would feel better by sharing their stories and this is a great way to stay away from crimes for these people. They would also feel connected to the society and would be glad for doing something good. Alternative ways of educating young people about the menaces of committing a crime are letting teachers educate students. However, in my opinion, this is not that efficient as students would treat those as class lectures, not real life interesting stories to listen to carefully. Educating students through stories and films can also be effective but they are not as much interactive as sessions with ex-prisoners.
It is true that several people have changed themselves to be a better person after they had been released from prison. And it is believed that they are better in giving advice to young people about the negative effect of crime. I personally agree with the statement and the following essay will discuss in details about it.
To begin with, it is a fact that the public usually has negative images to ex-prisoners, but not all of them have a bad personality. As some prisons provide technical skill and personal development program to their prisoners, many of them have successfully followed these positive programs. These courses have changed their character and provided them with adequate skill, therefore, they were accepted back in the society. Many of them have learned their lessons during imprisonment, as they worked harder and became more successful than the regular people. Apart from psychopath criminals, an ordinary person, who has committed crimes and has been sentenced to be imprisoned often understand the value of life and thus changes radically.
But in many countries, the crime rate among young people has been increasing significantly in the past few years. I believe that the best way to reduce the rate is by having some campaigns and testimonials from former prisoners who had changed their life. With their shares, it is hoped that it will open and broaden the view of the young people, about the dangerous side of crime. They would also become an effective mentor because they understand the condition of these teenagers, as they had experienced the same situation before. With their guidance, it is hoped that many teenagers will improve their life and become a better person.
In conclusion, I totally agree that some former prisoners who had changed their life would be a good advisor for the young generation. Their unpleasant experience would be a valuable lesson for the young people and hope that the teenagers would avoid crime activities in the future.
Essay 496:
There is no doubt that crime rates have dramatically increased over the last few years. Some criminals managed themselves to become good human beings while their stay in prisons. One of the reasons is that they have practically seen the problems and sacrifice they had to make. Some people argue that these are the best examples of creating awareness about crimes in teenagers. However, others state that a person with a criminal background will not leave indispensable impressions on people minds.
Firstly, it is the duty of government and the people to identify the aspects of crimes in teenagers. After that, there should be workshop and seminars which should highlight the consequences of committing crimes. It is also the responsibility of parents and guardian to have an eye on their children’s activities. While making little efforts, one can save many criminal activities in their surroundings.
Secondly, people who were the part of immoral doings and became good citizens after prison could help teenagers in eradicating this short of sins. They have personally experienced all the suffering they had to go through after compelling crime. They know the possible reason, why and how youngsters get involved in such cruel doings. Their worlds would leave undeniable impressions on people minds and will help to eliminate crime from the society.
Finally, I strongly believe that once a criminal is not always a criminal. If one has regret about his past and has changed himself should be treated like a normal human being. Furthermore, they could help teenager from remaining away crimes while telling them about their sacrifice of time, health and family.
In recent years, imprisonment is assumed as the finest method of punishment to offenders of law because after running the punishment time, the majority of people tend to be good members of the society. This condition derives plenty of people think that the prisoners are convenient speakers to talk to adolescents about the precarious of breaking the laws. I personally agree with that statements and I have some reasons to support it which will be explained briefly in the following paragraph.
First and foremost, detention given to the criminals is usually followed by training and educations that will be utilised in their future life. For instance, they are taught about religion and how to survive their life in the right way such as lessons for becoming a tailor or a painter. Those lessons make them likely to be better inhabitants and might easier to be accepted in their circumstances after completing their penalty.
Furthermore, due to the experiences obtained as long as running punishment, they seem to become suitable speakers to tell the teens about the difficulties that might be faced when living in a prison .To illustrate, they can share how regretful they are after committing a bad action and how they felt and repented because they cannot meet their family and cannot act freely like others. This story will certainly be remembered by the adolescents since they hear about those bad impacts directly from the prisoners so they will think twice if they want to disobey the applied rule.
In a nutshell, It can be concluded that majority of people become better citizens after obtaining lessons at the jail and because of the experiences acquired in the jail, they are likely to be suitable people to tell the teenagers about drawbacks which occur owing to be a criminal.
It is true that imprisonment helps the offenders to develop an acceptable character in the society and family. Even though ex-offenders can teach about the consequences of crime very clearly, I am of the opinion that they are not role models for the teenagers due to various reasons.
To start with, teenagers should not learn the effects of illegal activities from the ex-lawbreakers as this way of learning may cause to generate a tendency for imitating such activities in children’s minds, especially who have a lack of maturity and curiosity. Moreover, since ex-offenders have the past history of crime, they are not ideal individuals to teach the younger generation effectively. Social stigma is another factor, which means that social leaders often try to keep away the ex-prisoners from the mainstream of society owing to social status issues. Consequently, they are reinforced to engage in criminal activities repeatedly and they would also be terribly isolated.
Again, each society has their own prestigious law enforcement system to promote legal awareness in children, which is more effective teaching than learning from the ex-offenders. As such, ex-prisoners are not required to guide teenagers in spite of jail life experience for a certain period of time. An ideal example would be the organisation of awareness programmes of the police department in school settings in India.
In contrast, there is another line of thought that ex-prisoners are the ideal teachers to make awareness among children regarding the detrimental effects of criminal offences because they have real life exposure in such tough situations. Apart from this, these bitter lessons about punishments can create a strong influence in children, which in turn can generate an innate fear in them to involve any criminal activity. Eventually, children would deter from lawbreaking activities and they become productive citizens in future. Nevertheless, it cannot be denied that the ex-prisoners have a clear criminal background and an inner desire to perform such activities again.
Essay 497:
In spite of our living in an electronic age that offer many modern devices like TVs, tablets, laptops, washing machines, the internet we still follow some old way entertainment like the circus.  Circuses still are known all over the world and the clowns, jugglers or trained animals entertain people to a great extent. Furthermore, the circus is an interesting part of the entertainment for a minority of people in many areas of the world.
These days, technology has become very popular and almost every human has at least one technological device. In addition, engineers discover new products very frequently and it does not take too much time for these devices to become known all over the world. Therefore, these devices comprise a big portion of people's entertainment, in particular, for youths. And that is why circuses are very dull for them. In spite of this fact, it is evident that children are very interested in circuses and we cannot conceive at how they are entertained by these shows. In addition, clowns' interesting actions and jugglers tricky games are still predominant part of entertainment which amuses people, especially children. And it is undeniable that trained animals such as lions constitute the majority of amusement. Their perilous actions are the prime example of the circus' entertainment. In spite of the minority of people are interested in the circus, it is still a well-known form of entertainment and it is fact that circus' history can be traced to the Roman Empire.
To sum up, despite the fact that majority people is not interested in the circus and I am sure that there are ones who didn't bother to come to the circus, circus still keeps its popularity around the world.
The circus is still an attractive type of entertainment nowadays. Although myriad types of amusement are now available between our hands by means of phones, tablets and laptops, circuses can still draw attentions of many people. In my point of view, main reasons for that are children and traditional appeal of it.
Firstly it is known by everyone that today people are utilising and dealing with technology and its advantages more than everything else. It has been an undeniable part of our everyday life. A life without electronics is imperceptible for modern people. However, people always want something distinct and spread their sights to visual and attractive distractions. One of the most spectacular and concurrent attractions is undoubtedly the circus whose history is extended to thousands of years ago. Various shows there have fascinated people for a long time and are still fascinating enough to people who have never seen acrobats, dancers, clowns and people who are playing with domestic lions, elephants, snakes and other dangerous animals.
On the other hand, people have the other reasons to participate in circus shows their children. Kids who are interested in almost everything are keen on to watch dancing animals and jugglers. Hence, parents take their children to this kind of shows to make them aware of what is going on out there and show them exotic animals. Therefore, amazed kids want with a desire to go the circus again and observe other types of shows.
To conclude, in my opinion, visual attractions of the circus and attraction by children are two predominant reasons for the popularity of the circus. It seems its progress in popularity will not decrease in forthcoming future too.
Essay 499:
It is a true fact to consider that in the present day society, the advertisement has become most popular media resource in the competitive market. Considering this, there are some analysts who hold an opinion that the public schools are better places to advertise to increase the funds for the schools, while others consider that it will cause to children to be exploited it will make them as captive audiences. That essay will assertion both side of the contentions before deducing a reasonable conclusion.
There are many people who speak not to place advertisements to increase funds in public schools. First and foremost, distracted juveniles could be a significant factor. It is generally seen that when companies place the huge colourful advertisement in school, children would more focus in advertisement and they would put less concentrate on studies. For instance, the majority of the businesses are placing advertisements in schools to focus more students’ attraction for their products. Therefore, if pupils do not have enough money to fulfil their requirements, they might get involved in some sort of criminals activities. It is natural that if a billboard advertisement focuses on presenting luxury items, poor students whose parents cannot afford them would feel deprived. 
There are some groups who are in favour of placing advertisements to increase fund in public schools in spite of views discussed above regarding not to placing advertisements in public school. An increasing number of facilities could be a substantial reason behind the opponent's viewpoint. Nowadays, businesses spent thousands of dollars for reaching their competitive market. Therefore, if they can place advertisements in the right place they would spend more than usual, for example, sponsoring for new buildings and equipment.
In last, undoubtedly, whether placing advertisements in public school or not is always a matter of discussion; however, as far as I am concerned, advertisements should be banned in the school environment and we should make better and serene environment for kids in schools.
Essay 500:
Before starting the discussion on the essential role of death penalty or life sentence, we have to think about its meaning, purpose and factors behind the crime. In our society, people do crimes for the sake of their needs and sometimes for fun and also for the satisfaction of their emotions. In my opinion, if we focus our attention on the causes which put the person on criminal-route then it will be very useful to take the prophylactic measure to stop the happening of crime.
Death penalty is on the extreme of law enforcements and there are a lot many steps on the way to reflect the fear and respect of law. Criminals who kill others they do this not only for the sake of money but other factors like mental illness, deprived feelings, ignorance and cruel tradition also contributes. If our system of education detects these underlying factors in childhood then we can convert these lethal segments of society into useful stuff.
Few countries have implemented the rule of capital punishment more aggressively and people over there are very frightened and depressed. Sometimes, powerful people take the opportunity to misuse the law against their enemies.
We should invest more resources in education, law enforcement on minor crimes and try to punish little people for minor faults. For heinous crimes death penalty should be there but proceeding should be very fair to avoid human bias.
Essay 501:
Many people argue what should be done about the consequence of international aviation tour regarding the environmental issue. Some people perceive that it is the best to diminish the number of international flights, however personally I believe that it should not be prohibited regarding some reasons. This essay will look at this issue from time efficiency and health security point of views.
Firstly, the international aviation voyage is considered to be an essential element in determining time efficiency. Several years ago, when the air travel was not as high as today, people sought to use boats or other transportation vehicles to visit a place or more for some business or even just sort of vacation. They had allocated plenty of time just for one vacation, however, since the air travel has become more popular, people are no longer need to wait for ages when having trips to other places. Thus, they can utilise more time for other activities they already planned to.  
Furthermore, the international air travel may also be an alarm for health security agent to be more active in controlling disease transmission through air travel. As international air travel may ease the mobility of people travelling from one to another place, the high transmission of some disease is also susceptible either for the traveller or even other community. Since that, the health agencies will be stimulated to expand the prophylactic intervention to ensure that the travellers are secure from disease and will eliminate the spreading of diseases itself.  
Other forms of transportations like cars and engine boats are causing more harm to our environment and that is why the number of flights should not be restricted. Air travel is far more convenient and time-saving for people and restricting them would simply create inconvenience for people. When we can reduce the damage made to the environment by controlling the deforestation, car ownership and by other means, air travels should not be solely responsible for the environmental damage.  
In conclusion, the international aviation trip can maximise human life. It apparently breaks the limitation of time and space that many people may consider about and also may be a crucial reminder for health security. Life will not be this convenience if the overseas aviation is confined.
Essay 503:
Nowadays, there has been a positive trend that sport has gained popularity in society. However, others think that sport just leisure activity. In my perspective, both parties are reasonable which I will elaborate below
First of all, it is undeniable fact that there are some reasons why sports is essential to society. One of the reasons is that people can become healthier than ever before. By playing sports frequently, people can release toxin from their body in order to help the government to save money which is allocated for health insurance's residents. For example, the number of obesity and heart attack, today, decrease significantly throughout the world because of sports implementation. Another reason is that young generations are able to cultivate a good habit. With the rapid advancement of technology, they tend to do sedentary activities such as playing computer games and chatting through social media as well. If parents encourage their children to do sport instead of playing games at home, children can improve their social interaction with peers.
However, there are opposing arguments saying that a sport is nothing more than a leisure activity. It is true that sport can be counted as a leisure activity because not everyone has the abilities and potentials to become professional sports person. Therefore, people generally consider it a simple activity for relaxing their mind and body during holidays. Apart from this, many families see sport as the way to strengthen the sense of belonging to relatives especially for children because parents' time is spent more to do job tasks and put less care on them.
All things considered, although some people believe that leisure activity is the same as sport, I still think that sport plays an important role in the society because it has brought advantages to people in terms of health and social areas.
Essay 504:
Obesity has recently become a common worldwide heath issue as a manifestation of sedentary lifestyle of people. We should know exactly what the reasons are behind this and then try to solve it accordingly.
The main reason for obesity is because of the unhealthy, unbalanced diet many people have. People tend to eat easily cocked, ready to prepare fast foods or what we call junk foods. These short of junk foods do not contain any nutritional values and they are rich in oils, fats and sugars, and deficient in the basic nutritional elements like proteins, vitamins and minerals. Also with the advancement of the technology, there is widespread use of genetically modified foods which is totally unhealthy and carry the risk of many serious illnesses like Cancer. Secondly, the fast trend of life nowadays made people lazy and lack the motivation and energy for exercise.  Perhaps they ended up gaining weight because the exercise and physical labour are completely absent from their lifestyle. Finally, the modern society that we live in promotes the easily made food items without focusing on the contents and food values. Furthermore, they promote for the muscle built formula with ignoring the value of exercise and physical fitness which is not effective at all.
The solutions for this problem need a total change in all of our eating habits. We should revise the contents of all of our daily foods and ensure that it provides us with all the basic nutrients and all of our heath-requirements for example, fruits, vegetables, milk, fish, meat, etc. Moreover, we should add the exercise to our daily routine, as the doctor recommend that we should practice walking daily for a minimum of 10 minutes. Also, we should implement this concept in our new generation to raise a good healthy family. The governments should  have a great role on this by organising a campaign that would advertise for a healthy lifestyle and offer places for free walking and a sports centre at a low cost.
Essay 505:
Many countries have recently observed that there is a declining trend in the number of people watch movies in the cinema. This essay will discuss possible reasons for the declination of movie viewers as well as some solutions to address this issue.
In the era of globalisation, people are more interested in spending their leisure time at home rather than hanging around especially catching a movie in the cinema. It could be a factor that contributed to the matter. Effect of busy and tight schedule of working days, people are more interested in relaxing their mind and muscle at home while watching a television program or doing something which is very meaningful for them. For instance, the television programmes are definitely enough for them to watch and enjoy while staying at home nowadays. There are a lot of channels including music, movies, documentaries, home box office, comedian shows, news show and others which can make people think twice before going to the cinema.
Easy access to online movies is another reason people visit cinema less frequently. It is natural that people would prefer to watch the latest movie on their plasma screen 3D TV at home rather than spending money to buy cinema tickets. Online movies and piracy have negative effects on the number of cinema viewers nowadays. Finally, low quality of locally made movies is another factor that discourages people in visiting cinema halls.
In order to tackle this issue, film authorities and the government need to be involved and take further actions, so that our film industry does not face the extinction phase. The first and foremost thing is the director should produce a fresh and high quality of story line which can give more benefits and eventually able to attract people to watch films in the cinema. Next, the cinema organiser or company can make an effort to advertise the film widely and give a promotion day for the people. For example, establishing a special day with the special low rate of movie tickets might attract more people to go the cinema.
Piracy should be prevented and better cinema halls should be built to attract people to watch movies in the cinema. Lastly, the government perhaps can invest some money for improving their film quality to the international level and consequently can increase the confidence level of people toward the locally made films.
In conclusion, the number of people who go to the cinema is declining nowadays and that might be due to easy access to the cinema at home, satellite TV channels, piracy and low-quality local films. This problem could be addressed through different ways such as producing good and quality films locally, offering a low rate for tickets, preventing piracy and encouraging people to watch movies in cinema by wide range advertisement. The government also can make some investments for the film as to increase the film quality to the international level.
Essay 506:
In today's modern era, cinema is playing a significant role. It is an important way to spread messages to the public and it also acts as a source of entertainment nowadays. However, in the recent years, people moving away from it. Due to fewer numbers of people prefer to watch movies or play in the cinema. In this essay, I shall discuss some possible causes and also would like to give my suggestion to increase the attendance in cinemas.
First of all, the Internet provides all the new released movies and plays. Although it is recorded from cinema or anywhere else, people like to watch it because it is free of cost. Because it is easy to find video over the Internet, public do not go to the cinema to watch movies. They know that after some time of release, the movie will be available on the Internet. In reality, there are many websites available where you can find many new released movies. Further, piracy is not limited only for the Internet. Many people, who do this piracy, burn CDs and sell it in the market. However, this is illegal but still it is being done in front of us. Furthermore, with advancement in technology, the time lag between the releases of movies is very less. At the same time, hundreds of movies are releasing. This trend kills the interest of people about cinema. Lastly, hundreds of channel over cable network playing movies on television. People know that after some time, movies will be played on television. So they keep patience and do not go to the cinema. Besides the quality of local cinema are also questionable.
To tackle this problem of declining cinema viewers, we need to face the piracy problem first. Piracy is the most affecting cause of cinema attendances’ declining in the modern world. Laws which work on piracy should be amended accordingly and strong punishment should be given to those who are found guilty of it. If anyone pirates this copyrighted property should be arrested and then this will generate a fear in others who pirates movies. Secondly, the websites which offer free download should be wiped out from the internet as they violets the piracy laws. If the public does not find any free download sites then they will shift to the cinema. Thirdly, the film production companies should not sell their newly released movies to the television channel owners. This step will definitely affect the watcher and they will move to the cinema. Piracy is an illegal act and the law enforcers should be active to prevent it. People should be encouraged not to support piracy. If a common man understands that the people are making a black money by selling a pirated CDs then definitely they will not support piracy. Thus cinema will, of course, gain some momentum with watchers. Lastly, local filmmakers should produce more authentic and entertaining movies that would make competition with the foreign movies.
To sum up, I would conclude by saying that the cinema will re-achieve its pace if necessary steps are taken and that should be done as soon as possible. However, the first step should be to tackle the piracy.
It is true that cinemas have not been attracting much public these days. There could be several reasons for this trend and to change this it is necessary to take some measures to make cinemas attractive again.
There are various reasons why people are not going to the cinema as much lately. One of the reasons is the easy access to the internet and the availability of thousands of movies to be downloaded. If one can watch a movie for free at home, it is hard to find a motivation to pay for it at the cinema. Another reason is that the price of the tickets has increased significantly. It is undeniable that the recent advances in technology have improved the experience of watching a movie in several ways. However, cinemas need to find better solutions to manage the costs of this new technology without overcharging the customers.
Some measures are quite simple to put in place and can make a huge difference in the attendance numbers. For example, the creation of promotions that reduce the price of the ticket on specific days of the week or give a discount to loyal customers. Another action that could be taken is to promote more the launching of a new movie. One example would be to create an event related to the theme of the movie, like a costume session for people to dress up like the characters of the movie.
Essay 507:
This is a true fact to consider that in the present-day world has become a global village and people have chances to travel all over the world due to decreasing the cost of international travel. Considering this, some analysts consider that the rising trend of tourism needs to be implemented in the potential countries. However, there are some pros and cons associated with increasing tourism in the world.
There are some significant advantages of the growing trend of tourism. First and foremost, economic prosperity could be a significant advantage to consider. It is generally seen that a few decades ago only developed countries and rich people had the chance to travel worldwide; however, due to the reduction of cost of air travel majority of middle and lower classes nowadays can afford to travel all over the world or within their own countries for different purposes.  As a result, many developing countries can emphasise their tourism and can earn from foreign tourists and that could be higher than in the past. It can be demonstrated by a recent survey in Sri Lanka that has more than 60% of total income received from tourism. Moreover, mitigating unemployment rates could be another merit of tourism as it offers an excellent opportunity for new jobs potential.
Despite, the advantages discussed above regarding rising tourism there are some negative effects which cannot be neglected without any careful consideration. Endangering culture, tradition could be done from the excessive presence of foreign tourists and that could be a detrimental fact. Environmental damages and mixed cultural influences are hard to tackle when tourism in a country flourishes.  
It is true that the cost of travelling overseas has become cheaper these days and it has boosted the tourism industry in many countries. The growth in the tourism sector has its own benefits and drawbacks and the following essay will discuss them in detail.
For a number of reasons, the development of the tourism industry brings a lot of benefits for many nations. Firstly, it creates a lot of job opportunities for the local people. As many hotels and restaurants are built along with the tourist attraction places, they absorb many local employments and reduce the unemployment rate. Secondly, the development will also increase the country's income. As the number of tourists from overseas increases, they spend some money in hotels and restaurants and these transactions are subjected to tax.
On the other hand, the growth of this industry also brings some negative effects to the country. As more tourists are coming to the country, more tourist attraction places are then built. Many of these places are made in nature conservation areas, whereas some wild animals would lose their natural habitat and bring negative impact to the ecosystem as well. And then some tourists also bring negative behaviours that affect the local culture. For example, in some Asian countries, people might not drink alcoholic beverages. However, as many westerners come to these countries and bring some liquor, many the local people are introduced to the beverage and started to drink alcohol as well.
In conclusion, it is true the growing trend of the tourism industry has a lot of benefits for many countries. However, it should be noted that it also brings some negative effects to these countries. I personally believe that it is the government task to make some clear regulations for the tourism sectors, therefore all the positive sides of the industry outweighed the drawbacks.
Essay 509:
In this modern world whether strict rules should be followed by children or not is a very critical and controversial issue. As we know that children are living in different societies and cultures, their behaviour and metal structures are different as well. For example, in Pakistan, more social and loyalty could be observed among children and they respect their parents in a very charming way. While respect is very common, friendly relationship among parents and children are not. On the contrary, in European countries, it is a bit different. In these countries, children have their own motto and they do those types of tasks only which they have set in their minds. However, they have a better and friendly relationship with their parents. So overall strict rules would not be suitable for all geographic locations, which might be helpful in some parts of the world. The strict rules in children behaviour have some advantages but also have some drawbacks which are discussed below.
First of all the children under strict rules and code of conduct will be responsible and very respectful to the parents, elder people and to the society. Such children build a stable and attractive society. The children in such society feel himself a responsible citizen, mature, and know how to treat others in the society in a respectful way. And the society of such children is free of heinous crimes and drug abuses. On the other hand, children who do not follow strict rules of behaviour become rude, selfish and undisciplined. And such children create hurdles in the society which create bad impacts on a society. And for such children, the government also try to develop such a law to demolish such bad elements from the society.
Strict rules for children often have very bad psychological and social problems. It is not unusual that parents who bit their children would be hated and not respected by the children at a later stage. Strict rules hinder the creativity among children and make them under-developed mentally. A friendly relationship between parents and kids is often helpful for a better future generation. Strict rules are temporary but love and respects are long lasting. Hence parents should try to be friendly with kids and try to explain the right from wrongs. In many society children’s rude and unexpected behaviour are rooted to the too much strict regulation they were imposed. Hence, a set if strict rules is not always a better option to nurture kids.
It is concluded from this topic that Children under strict rule behaviour have a good moral character and responsible adults but sometimes this is not a good option and have negative impacts. So I would opine that friendly relationship, some freedom as well as some rigid rules should be combined to nurture the children and for their betterment.
Essay 510:
When it comes to the issue of success, a myriad of perspectives has been put forth. Some stick to the idea that hard work plays a key role in success whereas others are on the view that talent is an inseparable part of success. I personally state that the viewpoint put forward by the first group is more logical. In the following paragraphs, I will shed light on my reasons for this viewpoint.
The price of success is hard work. Perseverance gives rise to success. Individuals, who always succeed, try all times and never give up. It does not matter how many times they fail, they do not give up and stop their attempt till they reach their goal. They never call themselves failure! They really subscribe to the idea that the greatest accomplishment is not in falling down but in rising again and again after falling hard which sets the stage for success. With regard to the issue of gaining success, they really believe that winners never quit and quitters never win.  
On the other hand, just hard work without believing in ourselves and certain talents does not serve to achieve success. What is in our mind and how positive we think prepares the ground for physical action and eventually gives rise to hard work and gaining success. If we believe that we can achieve to whatever we want and we remove the negative thoughts which serve as mental barriers, we certainly succeed in gaining our goals. Having purpose is also important to work hard. If we know what we really want and why we need it clarifies our purpose which has beneficial effects on hard working. So, besides being hard working person it is essential to be hard planning person too.
In my view, I really concede that success is 10 percent talent and 90 percent hard work hard. Hard work and self-disciplined perform a pivotal role in gaining success, having a purpose and believe in ourselves are also required along with the hard work.
Essay 511:
Increasing consumptions of fossil fuels have resulted in the emission of the greenhouse gas which is one of the causes of issues relating to environmental damage in recent years. Therefore, some people suggest that all countries should take actions urgently to lessen the usage of the harmful energy. From my personal view, I agree with the statement to some extent.
First of all, it cannot be denied that fossil fuel is one of the major contributors to global warming and climate change. Indeed, the burning of oil and coal produces tonnes of carbon dioxide per year, and it is one of the greenhouse gases that enhance radioactive forcing and contribute to global warming. The rise in temperature of the Earth has associated with numerous of adverse effects such as melting of polar ice caps, flooding of low-lying areas and rise to the sea level.
Secondly, fossil fuels are generally considered to be non-renewable resources because they take millions of years to form. If the utilisation of mineral fuels is not reduced and controlled, it could be exhausted and people may soon run short of fossil fuels while scientists have not found an alternative energy source. As a result, the price of fossil fuels has also increased greatly which could lead countries to fall into a fuel war.
However, there might be some concerns about the reduction of mineral fuels utilisation. One among of them is that the approach will lead to failure to maintain well-balanced social order. In fact, manufacture industry, transportation and even home heating require powers, which are generated through fossil fuels. Accordingly, detrimental consequences might impact to the development of the entire the world if we cut down the use of fossil fuel immediately. More than that, some alternative powers such as nuclear, solar and wind power have not been applied widely due to reasons like climate condition, high cost or safety requirement. It could take scientist many years developing these energies to be perfect substitutes for fossil fuel.
In conclusion, in order to tackle environment problems and avoid the growing scarcity of natural energy in the future, the reduction in the consumption of fossil fuels should be considered and planned purposefully and gradually.
Essay 513:
The pace of life has reached such a dizzy height today that finding time for leisure has itself become cumbersome. When it comes to free time, some among the mass opine that it should be spent with diligence and prudence. However, others oppose this argument and insist that free time should not be something planned. Now the below discourse throws light on pros and cons of planning one's free time accommodating both views.
In the midst of the arisen of a new world order, planning and strategies play a vital role in our day to day life. Strategy and being strategically optimistic is considered essential factors of becoming successful, in this context, a leisure time spent with a proper plan is a leisure time spent wisely. A proper prudence, prior to spending your free time can invariably reduce the wastage of time and money involved. To exemplify, a well planned and organised vacation could save a lot of money and time on the hotel, transportation and so on. The monitory loss, on an unorganised holiday more or less is an explicit these days. Lost moments, are irreversible and planning one's holiday acknowledges the value of time. In addition to this, with a proper planning, one could avail the privilege of being an early bird, for instance, spending one;s time on shopping where there are more offers will be beneficial compared to navigating by the Sun.
On the contrary, some argue that free time should be spent instinctively and should not be biased to planning and prejudices. Such prerequisites spoil the enjoyment factor involved .They insist that not to plan, is the best plan to spend one's free time. According to them, leisure time should not get pre-indulged with definite plans as this would make it another mechanical day being spent in some other places than the office.  All that would take place on a leisure day should be impulsive, and not envisaged.
Now, from an objective analysis of the above-mentioned points, I would prefer to spend my free time in a well organised and judicious manner. As the saying goes "time and tide waits for none", proper planning will ensure less wastage of time. Moreover, such a habit comes with additional benefits of financial gains and much more. To conclude, it is apparent from the above that planning one's leisure time is imperative and rather ubiquitous nowadays.
Nowadays, people have become more organised and systematic and they like to plan their leisure time activities before execution. Some people argue that planning is vital for the successful implementation of any activity. Others claim that unplanned activities are full of excitements and surprises that are very difficult to achieve by planned work. I believe that proper planning plays a pivotal role in the completion of an activity within budget and resources.
Firstly, investing in leisure time demands careful planning of resources and timelines. Most of the people plan occasionally because of inflation and exorbitant prices of goods and travelling. In addition to this one can enjoy and explore more by planning. For example, during my college studies, I planned to visit hill stations with my college mated. Being as students we had minimal funds available for the tour. But with excellent planning, we end up our tour with full of joy and happiness.
However, unplanned free time activities also have a charm in it. Youngsters are more prevalent in exercising such activities because of its daring and adventurous nature. For instance, adults in my city start their journey on the highway without knowing their destination that followed by a decision made on run time which adds plenty of fun and surprise to their trip.
To sum up, I would like to say that planning is mandatory for achieving required results. Therefore, a large number of people plan and act accordingly to get the maximum pleasure. However, sometimes unplanned activities also provide you life-changing experiences.
Essay 514:
At first, it is significant to understand what is environment hazards and why is it escalating. Environment hazards mean a decrease in the quality of the environment where we are residing. Due to harmful gases such as CO2, SO2 emitted by industries, vehicles air is being polluted. The industries throw harmful waste products in rivers which affect the flora and fauna. Not only air and water are polluted, noise pollution has also surged. Same is the circumstances for arable lands.
So, it is clear that environmental hazards have increased not only by combustion of fuel but others factors are also responsible for it. I reckon increasing fuel price due to this reason is foolish tactics. According to the given assumption, increasing the price of fuel means not to make price common people friendly. If this manoeuvre of concern authority then they will come under fire subsequently and they cannot run the state. Transportation is a boon in the 21st century. We cannot imagine visiting our destination on foot as we cannot afford the cost of fuel. Fuel is essential not only to transport, it is required every walk of life. For instances: cooking food, running industries etc. requires fuels.  
Obviously, the poor either protest against the price or rob from those people who have purchasing power. It means unrest starts in the country. When it peaks some people loses their life and government is compelled to suspend the price increase. It is vivid that increasing price of fuel is not a solution to control environment hazards rather it unwise strategy. Increasing awareness, banning old vehicles dependency or introducing the renewable source of energy are some inevitable solution to environmental hazards.
In conclusion, the price of the fuel should not be increased rather others alternative should be deduced. Environment hazards are the common problems of people of every walk of life so, we should solve it moving ahead shoulder to shoulder.
Essay 516:
People have different opinions with regard to the question of what to consider while choosing a job. Although I agree the opinion that more incentives and benefits of the job make many individuals happy, I also believe that money is the crucial necessity to be considered to progress in life.
On the one hand, money should not be the only consideration. This is because, when we get a job that we cherish, there would be no place for work related stress and strain. Since we really appreciate our role, we could take the upcoming challenges as a chance to test our potential. The other benefits like health insurance, free medical services, travel allowances are also having positive impacts on the lives of the employees. Moreover, by working in a dream environment could definitely give much personal work satisfaction although it doesn't help financially. Therefore, according to the people who are inclined to the above beliefs, the best way to fetch a job is to completely analyse all these essential benefits and job satisfactions.
On contrary, earning money out of a job has paramount importance. Though there are other relaxations given for an employee, the direct source of happiness for them would be income. This means more money he earns the more he would confidently face the revolutionising world by meeting his self-needs, family needs and also by saving for the future. It is a commonly known fact that the inflation rate is increasing and also the cost of living has become high everywhere. In this scenario, it is absurd to be with a job which doesn't help to progress in terms of money. On the whole, money should be certainly the main consideration while choosing a job.
Finally, while I agree that allowances and enjoyment are prerequisites for career development, I strongly argue that income should also be given priority to get a job that makes us fit in the society.
Essay 517:
Nowadays, in this competitive world for success, knowledge and experience are very necessary. Therefore the students who get enrolled in a university directly from high school are less valuable and less contributive to the community as compared to those who take breaks during the study and take some experience through jobs and travelling. For these two different opinions, I am going to classify these two groups with names: group A and group B. Group A for those who do not take rest in studies up to university and group B for those who take a gap between school and university studies and get some practical experience in their lives.
As we know that study from high school to university studies will give us valuable theoretical experience only. Even in last year of the graduations university will send students to some of the companies for internships and apprenticeships to get training. But this is not enough for a practical job. A real job is something different and difficult from the training. When Group A students get jobs in a large company, they will face problems and they will not know how to handle the situations and how to deal customers and office staffs. Even some of their senior staffs will crush them hard and will tease them because fresh candidates do not know the work environment.
As compared to group A, group B students will be efficient and active and they will easily come across the problems and customers dealings. They will observe their senior staffs; what they are doing with them and they will response more professionally by using their experience and ability. The students from group B will be able to handle the corporate culture more appropriately only because they have better job understanding than the students of group A.
Group A students are less contributive also when a firm hires newcomers for a job. First, they have to train the newly hired staffs so more expenses are needed for that which comes from their salaries. And when they get experience, they are offer for better salaries. On other hand group B students from the beginning start earning more through their experience and work. This proves that group B is far more contributive to the new world economy.
So from the above discussion, it is concluded that Group A students are less efficient, less valuable and less contributive as compared to group B students. Hence in this modern era, we have to get a better education as well as better experience to become competent candidate everywhere. From this regards, taking a gap between the high school and university education to gain practical experience and understanding of the world is a better option.
Universities provide lofty education to their students under the supervision of trained professionals. However, they lack in providing practical experience of the subject to students. Some people argue that continuation of studies without break is less fruitful. Students should travel across the world to mitigate their stress and involve themselves into practical work in order to deepen the understanding of the studies they had learnt at universities. I believe that study break is an opportunity for people to enhance their skills by implementing their concept in the real world.
Practical experience plays a pivotal role in grasping difficult concepts with ease. By tightening the grip of a subject, one can become a master of it. Therefore, it is an essential part of learning to indulge yourself in a practical field after completing high school studies. It will equally beneficial for your knowledge and pocket.
Students without study breaks for travelling or part-time jobs are less likely to perform well in their professional lives. As they do not have practical working knowledge of things that deterrent their growth in the market, gradually they overcome their problem after having exposure to practical working. Moreover, they also lack behind in other qualities such as teamwork, confidence etc.
To sum up, I would like to say that learning by doing is the most effective technique that is commonly used by successful people. Therefore, universities should make it mandatory for their students to have practical knowledge of the subject before entering into university. Study without break could cause anxiety and stress and is less effective for young learners.
Essay 518:
It is said that support funds that are given to third world countries will not solve the poverty issue and therefore developed countries should think of other kinds of help, which are more effective. To a certain point, I would agree that there should be an alternative kind of help for the poor countries, but financial support would also be needed for a short time period.
Many experts believe that financial supports that are given to poor countries are not effective and efficient; therefore there should be other kinds of help which could be considered. Firstly, it is a fact that illiteracy has become one of the major issues in poor countries, and developed countries could send some of their teachers to improve the education system there. It is hoped should the literacy rate increase, the number of unemployment will gradually reduce. Secondly, people of the poor countries are suffering due to the low quality of the health system there. Building more qualified hospitals and improving the quality of the medical staffs would be an effective way to help them. And lastly, many third world countries have a bad infrastructure and public transportation facilities. By building more roads and improving the public transports there, it is hoped that people of these poor countries would be more productive as they will have easier access to their workplaces.
It can be seen that all of the alternative ideas are long term projects, and people would only see the improvement after ten or fifteen years minimum. For a short period of time, financial aid is still needed by the third world countries; as governments could not provide decent health and education system, and many people are starving and sick. However, since corruption is also a serious problem in poor countries, strict monitoring over the financial support should be a priority, to ensure that the fund is appropriately utilised.
In conclusion, to a certain extent, I would agree that financial aids given by advanced countries to poor nations would not be the best solution in solving the poverty issue. However, since resolving poverty problem would be a long term project, financial help should also be given for a short period of time, but it should be strictly controlled.
Essay 519:
I fully agree with the given statement as monetary help often failed to improve the condition of poor nations. So other forms of improvement schemes and help could be a better solution to help the poor countries.
It is true that donation provided by rich countries has not solved the problem of poverty in the developing country like Bhutan, Afghanistan etc. It is important to understand why rich countries provide money. The reasons behind this are to accelerate development of poor countries by establishing industries, tourism and others pre -requisites. Some of the causes for failure of donation programme are corruption, poor governance, scarcity of skilled population and lack of proper planning.
Firstly, corruption is mostly prevalent in the developing countries like Nepal, Congo etc.  according to data of the Transparency International. Most importantly, corruption is deeply rooted in almost all fields like health sector, civil service etc. and exists involvement of simple clerks to high-level bureaucrats and politicians. The cause of corruption may be rooted to the lack of handsome salary, lack of severe punishments, selfishness and the slack of rules and laws etc.  If money allocated for development projects is misused, then the quality of the projects reduced or it may not be finished in time. In fact, scenarios like these affect the rate of development in the developing countries.
Secondly, the sustainable and harmonious development cannot be achieved without effective and efficient administration which is lagging in the poor countries. Succeeding any projects is a daunting task for management committees. At first, the problems arise at the local levels where local people ask for unfeasible demands such as the job for each household, high compensation of lands etc. If these problems are addressed, then, other problems like the strike of employees occur or negligence of contractor occurs. Is it possible to complete projects at the specified time? No, it takes decades to complete the projects or strands in the middle forever.
Thirdly, there are problems in formulating plans and policies. Even though they are formulated, the authorities cannot implement in a scientific way. So, funds freeze for next financial year. These are only some instances how money provided by donors is used.
Education, expertise support, training, monitoring the development, conducting research, establishing factories are better alternative than giving money to the poor nations and these should be embraced by the rich nations to truly help the poor countries.
Essay 520:
Gender equality being the buzzword today, the position of women has undergone a sea change in all dimensions of life from the last couple of decades. It is a widely undeniable fact that majority of women now work and are becoming a mitigating factor when it comes to child-rearing at home. Now the question arises, on this trend being the main cause attributing to the increase in juvenile crime rates? In my opinion, married women being employed could be one among the many reasons involved in adolescent delinquencies and I would like to take a via media approach to this moot issue.
First, aspect to be discoursed in this context would be the mammoth change in the status of woman since last years. This change has had its influence on all social, economic and political spheres of life. In the present scenario, a predominance of employed female common partners is justified to some extent, because of the emergence of the new world economic order, globalisation. They play an imperative role in the society, unlike the past. Moreover, there are more female political figures than ever before on a worldwide perspective.
The fact remains certain that children of employed women are not well reared compared to their counterparts. Most of these children are forced to spend a major part of their formative periods with the babysitters or in kindergartens. Once grown up, they establish bonds with other people or students from different walks of life.  Unattended or left alone, it is these bonds that become detrimental for them in future.
The rate of adolescent crime rates and delinquencies are on an ever increase since last few years. Most of the cases when transacted meticulously portray the absence of motherly care and diligence in the upbringing of the child. Another fascinating thing would be that a majority of such children are from families where both parents work. According to various studies conducted by the panel of experts world over concise that whether employed or unemployed it is the carefree maternal attitude being the eminent reason behind the issue.
From the objective analysis on the above discourse, my conscientious allows me to conclude that irrelevant of being employed or not, it is the quality of maternal care during the formative period that should be accounted for the future prospective of one’s sibling.
Essay 521:
Trees, from all over the world, are diminished and are continues to be reduced by mankind, with many serious perils to our nature and people should not connive at this deforestation. We need oxygen for our survival and trees provide us this most important element for our living. Immediate individual and governmental steps should be taken to save our most trusted friends, trees.
Forests are the essential source of oxygen and trees encourages the soil and keep the ground from erosion. Furthermore, forests are habitats of a lot of animals and are home to myriad insects. People should take these aspects of forests into account and reform some regulations. The government should be more strict to control the unauthorised chop down activities. Namely, Amazon rainforest has been felled and used commercially and has already caused a huge damage to the wildlife and the environment. Consequently, proper legislations are very vital for preventing deforestation. In addition to legislations informing people might help to slow down saw down of forests.
In spite of the legislations are oppose to people who remove trees, people will not perceive how perilous these actions are and they will continue to cut trees without realising the danger. Due to their benefit from the trade, the most efficient way to prevent deforestation is to inform people. For instance, governments might make some advertisement to show on the TVs and also on the roads. Furthermore, making some interviews by experts in the news may be another solution.
More forest securities should be in place to prevent people from cutting down trees. Logging should be banned in areas where the percentage or forest is low and alternative ways of cooking should be introduced. Finally artificial and metal furniture should be used instead of using woods.  
To sum up, in spite of the vital roles forests play in our life people do not stop to cut down trees and use them for luxury. In this case, governments should reform legislations and inform people about logging danger. Without information people deforestation will continue for commercial use and array of animals and insects will get extended and we will endanger our mother planet.
Essay 522:
In recent year, there is a growing consideration for the government in term of child education, particularly payment for their tuition fees. Although this policy brings certain drawbacks, I believe that the benefits are much greater.
On the one hand, the policy of free education charge may place a dramatic burden on the national budget. The government may have to pour money in education, therefore financial fund could have not enough for other sectors such as infrastructure and medical care, which may hold the economy back from development. In addition, some taxpayers who live alone or do not have children may feel unfair because their money is likely spent for sake of others, not for theirs.
However, I would argue that the benefit of free of tuition fee should be more considered. First, among these is studying is definitely encouraged, which lead to the reduction of the illiteracy rate. As a result, the children who go to school will have more chance to find a job, and they would be the future workforce for the country. Take Singapore as an example, they have sponsored education fee for their young generation, which encourages them to go to schools or universities, this is reasons why Singapore has a high qualified manpower contributing for their development. Another significant advantage is that family may not be worried about financial burden because of high education fee, and they would have more money to take care nutrition and health care for their children.
Essay 523:
Increasing numbers of people have already become fond of travelling all over the world and the trend continues to be evident even during these recent times. Travelling has become a hobby among different individuals regardless of age, sex and race. Some people believe that increased travelling nowadays is because of many reasons including better communication and technological advancement and benefits of travelling to travellers are huge.
To begin with, one of the major reasons why travellers these days are motivated to travel different places is because of increasing opportunities and demands abroad. In abroad, people can visit their countries of choices to study as international students, work as a professional passionately and the appealing part of grabbing to become future immigrants because of the various benefits they will inherit compared to their country of origin. For example, my aunt decided to work as a licensed nurse in the USA and due to her undying hardworking attitude, she successfully submitted complete credentials and passed exams required for professional registration.
Another reason why people travel often is that they want to get stamps in their passports whenever possible. In this way, people will have easy access of travelling to places they wanted without hesitations or difficulties. They have the least chances of being denied by the embassies after calling up for an interview.
Essay 524:
In several countries across the world, the death rate has decreased dramatically. This may be due to several reasons and this essay will analyse those and also suggest whether it brings benefit or drawback to the society.
First and foremost reason for this scenario is the revolution of healthcare technology. This is because the fatal diseases or disorders which were considered difficult to fight against have become an easier task to tackle these days. Polio is one good example in India which no longer causes death or disorder among people which once was a very devastating disease. Moreover, the technical advancements are also facilitating complicated cardiac surgeries, organ transplantation and 3D printed organ replacement. So these illustrations are proving the worthy role of technology in enriching and enhancing of people’s life.
While the lifespan of individuals’ increases, it would obviously benefit in several ways both to individual and society. As far as a single person is concerned, if he lives longer then it is certain that he would complete all his responsibilities in a proper way and lead a happy and contented life with his or family. Looking onto the other side, the benefits outnumber the disadvantages here as well. Due to the contribution of persons like scientists, politicians and other leaders to the nation for a longer duration, the development of the nation is a reachable goal.
By and large, the people are having healthy and longer life because of the intervention of technology in the healthcare sector. This has been proven as a positive impact on both individuals and a larger community and thus can be taken as a sign of betterment.
Essay 525:
It is a true fact to consider that today's world has become a global village. Due to that reason, business has to face huge competition to catch-up the highly competitive market. Considering this, there are some analysts who hold an opinion that in the company top management should consider employees suggestions or ideas before making the decisions or innovation while others consider that they should take decisions on their own. This essay will assert both sides of the contention before deducing a reasonable conclusion.
Higher authorities should consider employees suggestions or ideas before taking important decisions for the company. First and foremost, job experience could be a significant factor. It is generally seen that majority of the people working in the particular area have become experienced professionals with different practical knowledge that the management could use in their favour for decision making. The fact could be demonstrated by in the food processing industry; food processing has been divided into various sectors such as harvesting, separating, filling, packaging and labelling etc. and to take decision appropriate employees should be engaged in the decision-making. The engagement of employees in decision making creates a very positive impression and inspires them to work better. The employees start feeling as part of the company and their output significantly increases. This is also an effective measure to control the mutiny  of the labour in an industry.
There are some groups who are in favour of the idea that management should not consider employees suggestions or ideas when they make decisions, in spite of views discussed above. Management responsibility could be a substantial reason behind the opponent's viewpoint. There are companies where it is believed that the higher management is responsible for coming up with the best decision and innovation for better a future because they believe employees add ideas or suggestions for their personal interests.
In conclusion, undoubtedly, company managements have higher responsibilities to take plausibility of implementation for the healthier future; however, as far as I am concerned, lower level worked force has immense experienced of their profession. Therefore, without any reasonable concern employees cannot be neglected and their decision and feedback should always be included while taking any decision for the company.
Essay 527:
Cities are transforming in various aspects, one of them is shopping pattern. It is often suggested by many that traditional businesses should be replaced by mega shopping centres. I believe that large shopping malls offer a better shopping experience to city residents and help the government collect taxes efficiently. Therefore, I believe that this is a welcoming trend.
To begin with, large shopping complexes bring different vendors under a single roof and offer a spectrum of products. As people in cities have less time to spend on shopping, mega shopping malls save their valuable time. Furthermore, such markets have various entertainment facilities including cinema halls, food court, children's play zone etc. which improve people's shopping experience and let them enjoy their time. All those amenities under the same building cannot be offered by small businesses.
In addition, collecting taxes from scattered small shops is often unmanageable as there is no defined authority for the business entities. However, it is easier when the stores are under the market authority in a single building. In some countries, like Australia, the government gives a tax rebate to small businesses to let them grow, which consequently can have dire outcomes in the future as financial overturn cannot be justified with those cuts. Thus, small businesses do not have a wide appeal to people and nor do financially help local government.
In conclusion, to conform to modern shoppers' demand and facilities, mega malls are emerging. This should be wholeheartedly welcomed as it offers a better shopping experience to people and ensures tax collection by the state.
Essay 528:
Large supermarkets are gaining popularity in many countries. Some people argue that small local businesses are finding it extremely difficult to survive in the midst of swift growth and development of supermarkets and that the local communities would die out as the local businesses shut down. I completely disagree with this argument and will try to explain in this essay why so.
The reasons for supermarkets becoming popular are manifold. Firstly, they provide a single platform to customers where they can purchase everything they need, ranging from groceries to clothing and more. Consequently, they do not have to make multiple stops at different stores to get the needful, hence, making shopping extraordinarily convenient. Secondly, they offer a number of facilities including car parking, toilets, deli counters, resting areas to make shopping a more comfortable and fun experience. Thus, pulling more and more customers and multiplying the business.
As more people opt to shop at supermarkets, local businesses suffer loss and eventually shut down. However, that, in no way, result in local communities' death. Today's customers are resourceful and educated. They have the means of transportation and time to go to supermarkets as shopping has transformed into entertainment. Convenience stores, on the other hand, still have a chance to survive by relocating to an area where there is enough clientage. All in all, local communities can travel to supermarkets just fine and can easily survive in the absence of local convenience stores.
In conclusion, supermarkets have given local businesses a tough time. In my opinion, local stores can relocate to carry on and even if they do not, local communities will survive by shopping at supermarkets because they are capable of doing so.
Essay 529:
This is a true fact to consider that the present world has become a global village. Therefore, people are motivated to buy their necessities from the competitive market. As a result, a great number of shopping malls has established in the past two decades in almost all cities of the world. Considering this there are some analysts who hold an opinion that large shopping malls are replacing small shops, while others consider that, large shopping malls should not be replacing small shops. This essay will assertion both side of this contention before deducing a reasonable conclusion.  
There are reasons for people to believe that large shopping malls are important to be established as multi stories shopping malls come with a large number of stores and other facilities under one roof.  First and foremost time saving from shopping from such multi-complex buildings could be a significant factor.  It may be defined as the majority of them prefer to go to the shopping malls rather than the single stores because a variety of options are available in one complex. For example, clothes, groceries, banks, pharmacies, cinemas, food courts, and restaurants etc. are all available under a single roof and people get better environment from such an establishment.  
There are some groups who are in favour of single shops and opine that this trend should be continued. They have their reasons as well.  In spite of views discussed above regarding why large shopping malls are ideal to the modern society.  Parking problems could be a substantial reason behind the opponent's viewpoint. There including excursive crowding in the shopping complex, especially on weekends and holidays. As a result, shoppers have to spend a long time in the parking bays rather than shopping in small shops.  The prices in large shopping malls are often unreasonable and people end up purchasing more than they actually need. The large shopping malls are not often convenient for the lower and middle-class population.
In last, undoubtedly, whether shopping in a large shopping complex or single small shops could be a matter of discussion; however, as far as I am concerned, big shopping malls have immense benefits to the modern society that outweigh the options and conveniences offered by the small shops.
It is true that the numbers of large malls have increased rapidly in the past few years, and many people believe that they are replacing the traditional shops. I personally feel that there should be some clear regulations about the design of malls in each city; therefore the existence of these shopping malls will not replace the small shops.  
It is a fact that many large shopping malls are built in big cities these days, such as in Singapore, Jakarta or Tokyo. These giant malls offer various kinds of shops in one place; therefore people should not have to go to different places when they are looking for their needs. Then, these shopping malls are also equipped with air conditioner, so visitors will feel comfortable when they walk around the malls. And lastly, these shopping malls also being managed and monitored by security guards, therefore many people feel safe walking around in these malls.
However, despite all the benefits of these large shopping centres, the existence of these shopping malls has some negative effects on small shops. Many property developers are building their malls near a traditional market, which affected the sales of many small and traditional shops. As more people choose to go to large shopping malls, the numbers of people who purchase at small shops become lesser and lesser each day. As a consequence, many of these shops owners have to close their business or have to reduce the number of employees.
In conclusion, the number of mega malls is increasing these days, and some people believe that they will replace traditional markets. I personally believe that the existence of shopping malls will boost the economic growth of the city, but small shops also create many jobs opportunities as well. So it is the government task to make some strict regulations about the city’s layout, therefore the existence of large shopping malls and small shops will be appropriate.
Essay 531:
In this era of globalisation, the world has witnessed a paradigm shift in migrating and these days more rural inhabitants are becoming city dwellers. Choosing a place to live has been a matter of great concern from the time of antiquity. Urbanisation, being the buzzword of the day, few among the mass believe that urban sector forms the ideal place to thrive, whereas others favour rural life. Let us discourse below the pros and cons of life in a city to that of a countryside.
The recent advancements in technology comfort the urban lifestyle in numerous ways. Means of transport and communication are explicit in cities compared to that of villages. Moreover, urban industries and companies offer huge opportunities to professionals and entrepreneurs. The younger generations prefer to live in the midst of city life and luxury rather than to be in a countryside. Another important aspect in this context would be the sea change in the medical field that happened in last few years, many of these advanced facilities are readily available only in cities. In addition to all these, city has become a social hub of the elite and affluent hence one could enjoy the privilege of being in acquaintance with them. To cite an example, one would find celebrities and politicians on the social clubs or parties, rather than a countryside’s get together.
As it is being noted,  reasons are aplenty for one's decision to choose city over a village  to lead a life in the present scenario, another among them which needs a special mention here is in the quality of education that city offers. It is believed that education liberates people from social stigmas. An urban life on a global perspective is always coupled with well organised and qualified educational system compared to the rural side. A city would be a favourite place to find efficient schools, universities and research centres when weighed against a village side.
On the contrary, rural lifestyle bestows one's closeness to nature and is free from the hazards of urbanisation. Health wise, rural inhabitants are less exposed to various environmental hazards, like pollution for instance. Moreover, the tranquillity maintained along the countryside is another positive feature of rural habitation. Finally, the family and social bonds in villages are known to be more concrete. Separations on basis of urban gizmos like communalism and social status are seldom there.
In the ultimate analysis, from the above discussion, it would be ideal to state that both urban and rural habitation has its merits and demerits, however, choosing a place to live should be prioritized on individual requirements, an ideal exemplification would be that of an IT professional who should become a part of a city for his career betterment, whereas a farmer, would fit in a rural sector to prosper. Being a part of an urban society since childhood, I would like to be in the same boat for the rest of my journey.
People have different opinions about living places. Certain people like to live in the country area while others choose to stay in the city centre. Each place offers its own benefits and drawbacks and the following essay will discuss them in detail.
On the one hand, a group of people prefer to live in the city centre because they believe that there are a lot of benefits living in the area. It is a fact that the city offers various kinds of facilities, such as shopping malls, universities, cinemas, hospitals and restaurants, therefore it would not be difficult for the city’s residents in finding education centres, foods or entertainments. Cities offer more job opportunities as most of the companies and industries are situated there. Apart from that, there are certain facilities that are present only in city areas like amusement parks, large shopping malls, better schools etc. However, living in the city has some negative sides as well. The common drawbacks are that the crime and air pollution rate in the city are commonly higher than the rural area. Therefore some people choose to move out of the city centre.
On the other hand, some people think that the best place to live is in the rural area. It is believed that people who live in these areas have a healthier life because they breathe fresher air, they eat more hygienic and natural fruits and vegetables and they live in a more relaxed and quite environment. As a result, their life expectancy is longer than those who live in cities or towns. Despite its positive sides, living in remote areas have some disadvantages. Several people found that the quality of education in these areas is left behind, while others feel that it is hard for them to develop their careers, therefore they choose to move to big cities.
In conclusion, living in the city or the countryside has its own positive and negative sides, and it depends on the preference of each individual. I personally choose to live in the city area to enhance my career and plan to live in the countryside when I retire.
Essay 532:
These days, many people are quite concerned about choosing the right place to live their own life. In this essay, I will look at the pros and cons, aspects of living in large and crowded town compared to the countryside and draw a reasoned conclusion based on my ideas.  
One of the most significant benefits of settling in a city is health care. Usually, there is well-functioning health care system available to citizens of the town such as hospital and clinics, with many specialised doctors and healthcare professionals. For example, in the city, it is very convenient to find physicians, dentists and nurses. In contrast, often habitants of the rural area have to travel all the way to the city to visit the professionals in the city. As a result, people who live in the countryside suffer from the lack of health care laboratories, hospitals and chamber of professional doctors which are not close to them and is one of the reasons people prefer to stay closer to city centres. Furthermore, a city offers better educational, recreational and employment facilities which are quite tough to find in a rural area.   
However, the crime is the biggest challenge that inhabitants of a crowded city have to face. For example, murder, rape, theft, motor vehicle offence, drugs abuse, firearms & offensive weapon cases are more common in city areas than in a countryside. Even with criminal justice system and punishment by state law in cities, the rate of these heinous crimes is much higher there than any other part of the country such as villages and rural area. The rate of the crime is much less in a countryside than a city due to the less population and economic factors of that area. As a result, the people who live in a countryside are much protected against violation of their rights.
In conclusion, both large towns and urban areas have some conveniences and drawbacks for its citizens.  Living location should ultimately be chosen depending on an individual's base on their professional job. For example, farmer ideally will choose the rural area and on the other hand, IT professional will prefer to be close to city centre.
Essay 534:
As the enrollments of different higher institutions are increasing each year, more students coming from countrysides or rural areas are attending universities. However, some of them feel the education in the university is hard for them to comprehend regardless of the contents of courses or the assignments placed by instructors. Regarding this situation, people think higher education institutions should lower the standard or level of study so that rural students can access them easily.
Admittedly, the education in higher institution sometimes really poses a tough situation on rural students. What they have learned or how they have processed the contents from school have to be changed once they get into universities. As a result of this, some of them are unable to adapt to the methods required to be used here. More frustratingly they might concern about dropping out if they could not continue their study. From this perspective, a higher institution should consider lowering the standard for rural students to keep the original pace of study.
In addition, although universities are not the place where everyone can get involved in, in another word, once any pupils have been accepted by them, they are supposed to realise how tough the study would be, this really depends on the backgrounds of different pupils. Therefore, developing bridge programmes seems an efficient method for both rural students and schools themselves. Not only can pupils enhance their capacities for acquiring higher education, teachers can also fully learn about each individual student. This contributes to ease the burden on difficulties on students.
However, to tackle this awkward circumstance means that schools are supposed to sacrifice to some extent. For instance, lowering standards for students from rural areas presents that the reputation that schools have obtained may be affected. More seriously, if this happened, the immediate impact on universities would be the loss of experienced teachers and funds raised by the local government.
In conclusion, to alter the strategies for assisting rural students to access higher education is one of the most important implementations that universities should consider. However, schools have to address this issue discreetly or it would pose a threat to school’s reputation and their employment of staff. Establishing bridge programmes seems to be one of the feasible approaches for achieving the balance in the number of rural students in universities.
Essay 536:
In spite of the fact that parents can make their decisions in terms of immunising or not immunising their children from deadly diseases, they have to feel a responsibility to their children. From my point of view, it must not be optional and all children have to be vaccinated.
We all know that children who are less than 6 or 7 age are vulnerable to diseases and should have fatal results or big problems in their forthcoming future life if they are not protected from heinous diseases. Though these childhood illnesses might seem very simple, parents must pay attention to their children who are at these ages. By the way, it must not be voluntary for parents to decide what they must do. It is also the future of the country and the nation in terms of having a strong nation. Namely, children comprise the basis of education in the country, so children have a bulk and vital role in the country in terms of education and future. For this reason, governments have to make something special for that, such as legislations. These sorts of regulations will make parents feel responsible for their children.
Children, who suffer from deadly diseases and get affected by that in future, actually start hating their parents. Think about how sad it would be when a child suffers from physical disability only because his parents decided not to vaccinate him in his childhood? That is something we never want to happen to our nation. Actually, there are also some families who want to immunise their children but haven't got sufficient budget to spend for that. In that way, governments have to undertake immunising such children and assign subsidies for those of children. People haven't got the rights not to vaccinate their children. This is not an option, this is a must. Because it is inhumane for both children and parents who might become the victim of deadly diseases. 
Every infant needs an aid of protection from any danger at their early age. One of the most predominant perils is absolutely illnesses. Any disorder can be able to face them with the risk of death, even a single flu because children are vulnerable and a potential target for viruses and other threatening creatures. Their immunity system is just started to grow and improve. If they are not fed well and protected from hazardous effects the immune system cannot thrive and the body will destroy soon.
That's why they are in need of their protectors at certain ages of weakness. It is evident that these protectors are their parents or responsible relatives. Hands of kind-hearted and generous parents are especially given for that reason. From the birth to the age of being an individual, parents look after their children with great patience and attention.
They devote their whole life to pay attentions to their protection like precious jewellery. This dedication includes health, happiness, culture and other qualities of their own personality. In front of those all health of their children is most crucial one. Kind-hearted parents always want their children to be healthy, because of that they immunise them very well. In their opinion, it is their obligation to do that. Unfortunately, some parents are in the other mind. They refuse to inoculate their children. It must be a scandal, because if parents decline to vaccinate them, then who should do the issue.
I think it is obviously the obligation of parents to grow up and immunise their children. Another variant could not be perceptible. And the government should impose a law for this type of parents to either immunise their own children or pay the expense of looking after them.
Essay 537:
It is undoubtedly the case that urban areas around the world increasingly suffer from traffic congestion. In this essay, I will examine the reasons for this trend and suggest some practical policies the authorities could implement to reduce the level of traffic in our cities.
The first step is to understand why traffic has increased in towns and cities. Broadly speaking, there are three main reasons for this. One is that cars have become more affordable for the average consumers and they are no longer a luxury item, but something that most families expect to own. A second reason is that public transport has become increasingly unreliable in recent years, not least because many bus and train services have been reduced because of the difficulty in funding them. The third reason is that society has, in general, become more mobile and this means more people are prepared to commute to work by car than they were before.
There is almost certainly no one solution to this problem given the complexity of its causes. However, one option has to be to improve the reliability of public transport to encourage people to take the bus or the train rather than get in the car. It would also be possible to discourage people from driving to work by introducing special tariffs for using the roads, especially during peak periods.
In conclusion, there are a variety of different factors that have led to rising levels of traffic in urban areas. While it may not be possible to find a complete solution but actions should probably involve encouraging more use of public transports.Furthermore, taxes on private cars should be increased and eco-friendly transportation like bicycles should be promoted.
Essay 538:
It is a fact that traffic congestion has become a serious problem for many cities and towns. More and more people get stressed with this situation, as they have to spend hours after hours in the street and lose their productivity and valuable time. The following essay will discuss the cause of the issue and some of the solutions that can be taken into account.
For a number of reasons, traffic has become the main problem of many cities and towns all over the world. Firstly, as the population growth in many metropolis cities such as in Shanghai, New York, Dhaka and Bangkok has increased rapidly in the past recent years, it means that there are more cars in the city. Secondly, in some cities, such as in Jakarta or Manila, public transportation facilities are poorly managed therefore the people choose to drive their own vehicles. Lastly, in many countries such as Indonesia or China, the economic development is not widely spread, and a result a lot of people from rural areas move to cities which would create traffic related problems. The number of commuters in many cities has increased dramatically but in proportion, the total number of roads remained almost same as it was in the past. Many people are buying private cars and it is not unusual that many families own more than one car. These two reasons with the poor traffic management system in many cities cause unmanageable traffic jam nowadays.  
However, there are several things that the government could do to reduce the problem. The state government should provide decent, safe and clean public transportation facilities, therefore more people would use public transports, instead of driving their own private vehicles. And then the government should develop new industrial and commercial areas outside of the city. It is hoped that some people would move to these new areas, and would reduce the density problem. The government could provide some bicycle lane, as it brings a lot of benefit for the people and the city itself. Bicycles as the primary means of communication could reduce traffic. It is also safer for the environment and has positive effects on the rider’s health. The roads and highways should be expanded and new roads should be introduced. Severe punishment should be imposed for violating traffic rules and restriction should be implemented in private car ownership. Finally, improved traffic system should be introduced and unfit cars and vehicles should be removed from the streets.
In conclusion, cities and towns all over the world are facing serious traffic problem these days. It is mainly due to of the population growth, density and poor public transportation facility. But there are several things that the government could do to address the problem, such as improving the public transports, developing new areas and persuade its resident in using bicycles.
Essay 539:
In today's world, traffic congestion is an extremely difficult problem for commuters around the globe. A 10 minutes office to home ride had become a pathetic 40 minutes or even longer ride, spending one's valuable time on roads. This essay will explore some of the causes and recommended practices to reduce this issue.
The possible sources for increased traffic could be from several factors. Firstly, I consider migration of people from urban areas to cities in search of making a living as one of the primary reasons. This, in turn, leads to increased number of vehicles on the road. Based on a recent study conducted by the Transportation Department of London, there is a 20% surge in volume of car sale in the United Kingdom each year over the last decade. Secondly, failing to adhere to traffic rules is another factor contributing to the waiting time due to traffic.
The government and public should be pragmatic about the actions that will solve this issue. The government should encourage using public transport instead of personal vehicles because in my country one will hardly find a co-passenger in a car other than the driver. In addition, the traffic control department should implement stringent traffic rules, for instance, diverting traffic in peak hours on a particular avenue.
In summary, a rapid rise in the car users is one of a major reason for increasingly pathetic traffic congestion. The government and public should cooperate to reduce the number of vehicles by using public transport.
Essay 540:
Universal entertainers, containing sports individuals, frequently acquire millions of dollars in a single year. From my point of view, these devastating incomes are absolutely unfair while the world is dealing with a great scale of poverty. The solution for this type of matter undoubtedly must be established as soon as possible.
When wealthy part of people started to incline attractive and dashing entertainment the entertaining agencies' jobs initialized to grow and improve. Improvements enhanced the scale of amusement sphere. Consequently, the supervisors and main individuals of this entity handled the currency circulation soon and easily. Today the rich spend a large amount of money on sport and entertaining facilities. for instances, in only 2 or 3 weeks long European Olympic Games millions of dollars are allocated by Azerbaijan's government this year. Although these games have many profits for a country, in my opinion, the disadvantages of this issue are more than offset by advantages.
Maybe some people think that these enormous salaries for sports people and entertainers are the value of their effort and work. Nonetheless, I am on the side of people who are contrary to this kind of insight. And this contradiction is not arbitrary because people who suffer from famine, unfortunately, are the predominant part of our humanity. I believe it is not right to impose such amount of money and support to joys contributing it towards the relief for people who are in need of it.
Nevertheless, I believe that people who are in aware of their environment's issues will do the right thing. In these days, some companies and entities which are built to solve these problems have undertaken to provide money and support for famine relief.
Essay 541:
The ever increasing job competition, the pressure of constant deadlines, the technological dependency in jobs and people’s expectation to thrive in the workplace have changed the definition of professional life and most of the employees require to work harder and for long hours each day. In this essay, I will examine the reasons behind this work pressure and lengthy working hours and suggest some ways that the employers can help improve the condition.
High competition in the job market is one of the reasons why jobs have become such stressful these days. Employers always have options for finding new employees and replace someone and this is why someone who has already been hired has to work hard to save his job. This naturally has negative psychological effects on employees. Employees have to work for longer hours to meet their performance target as the invisible threat of firing is there. Increasing competition caused by globalisation is another reason to make the workplace such stressful. Many small and medium business entities need to compete with other multinational companies and companies in developing nations where labour price is cheaper. The effect of this on employees is that they know they may be made redundant if the business they work for fails. This force the employees not only to work longer hours but also suffer from work-related stress and uncertainty. In most of the organisations, the employers these days set targets for the employees and most of the targets are hard to achieve. As a result, employees are forced to work beyond 10 hours per day and even on days-off. Finally, people’s expectation from the offices have reached to a higher position and people are ready to sacrifice their personal life for the sake of promotions. This shift of mind setup has also attributed to the increasing work pressure.
Despite the higher competition in business, employers should ensure a healthy working environment and support their workers morally and financially in order to sustain in the long run. An organisation cannot survive without experiences and dedicated employees and constant fear of uncertainty cannot ensure a healthy workplace. Employers should encourage employees to work the regular hours and work overtime only when it is absolutely necessary. The employers should also encourage people who perform better and award them for their performance. The workers should be allowed to take breaks and should not suffer from anxiety of losing jobs. Finally, the employers should have a friendly relationship with the workers and have meetings to listen to their problem. If the employer can assure the employees that they are ready to help each other and their jobs are secured, they can then expect better outputs from the employees.
In conclusion, higher competition in the job market, globalisation and people’s aim to reach higher are the main reasons for stress in the workplace and the employers have a lot to contribute to improving this situation. A healthy workplace is very crucial for the best performance by the employees.
Essay 542:
It is a fact that working hours are getting longer and the work pressure is getting more intense these days. There are various reasons that have caused the situation and there are some things that employers can do to help their staffs. The following essay will discuss them in details.
For a number of reasons, people’s working hours are getting longer and jobs are getting more stressful nowadays. Firstly, it is due to the tight competition in the labour market. As the supply of labour is higher than the demand, it means that there are more people who are looking for jobs and employers could be selective in hiring their potential employees. As a result, employers would select labours who are multiple talents, could work for long hours and could handle many tasks. Secondly, as business competition become tougher these days, companies are working in a more effective and efficient manners. Consequently, there will be less manpower in many companies, which means they only recruit selected people who can do many things at once and could work long hours.
There are several things that employers could do to solve the problem. It is believed that exercises could reduce stress level, therefore many companies are providing fitness centre in their office these days. This facility can be used by their employees outside of the working hours for free and it is hoped that employees could maintain their health condition. And then, employers could also hire unpaid internship to assist their employees.  It is expected that with the assistance of internships, it would reduce the workload and working hours of employees.
To sum up, it is a fact that works are more stressful and take longer hours these days. To solve the issue, there are some things that employers could do, and one of them is providing gym facilities to employees for reducing their stress level.  Another thing is that employers could also recruit unpaid internship to assist employees as it would reduce the long working hours.
Essay 543:
In recent years, youngsters live a sedentary lifestyle due to their lack of time to relax even to play around with their peers. Moreover, the school duties sometimes bring them in full of pressure. I strongly believe that this case is caused by the parental pressure and university competition. Therefore, this essay will look into the causes provided by some solutions.
Parents sometimes bring pressure toward the children’s life since parents demand the children to pursue a higher future career. They tend to encourage children to spend their time for study, even they are not afraid to spend money for children education. For instance, parents will put the children into several courses which are relevant to their study. They believe that bringing children to the course will pose a help to master their studies at school. Therefore, there is no spare time for young people to enjoy their life.
On the one hand, university competition force students to study much harder since university just recruits or accepts students who have higher grades.  Entering university level will create a high competition among others nationally even internationally. Moreover, the university has a high standard as a requirement. Consequently, to gain the standard, young people should make good preparation. Therefore, it sometimes makes young people under-pressure even depression. They will try to do something that enables them to gain their goals such as study a lot.
As the result, the best solution to cope with these problems is the awareness of parents. Parents should realise that their actions can cause anxiety and stress among the children. Therefore, bring back the role of parents is essential in this case. They should understand the children’s condition thus children can use their spare time to stress-relief such as go on vacation or hang out with their peers. Additionally, affirmative action is needed to overtake the university case. The government should expand the number of universities, thus it can reduce the competition level and young people would then have a variety of choices. As the result, youngsters would be able to spend their teenage time with joy and happiness. 
To sum up, the understanding between parents and children will bring a beautiful harmony and followed by a support from the government. Therefore, it is easy for youngsters to suffer from this problem.
Essay 544:
It is true that the older generation, in most of the cases, adheres to many traditional values, belief and old way of thinking and many of these are not suitable to make the youngsters ready to take challenges in this modern era. There are still some values and traditions that are useful and older generation should pass
To begin with, many ideas that older generation still finds unavoidable have become less relevant for the young generation and it is a good thing that the youngsters have less faith on the superstitions our forefathers believed in. Besides, the traditional belief of educating a boy and upbringing a girl so that he becomes the breadwinner and she can become a good housewife is no longer accepted by the modern era. The traditional belief of fixed role for men and women are no longer applicable to this advance era where people believe in gender equity. Furthermore, the modern generation no longer agrees to take the fact that a student has to study to become either a doctor or an engineer. According to the old belief, these two are the careers someone must have. With the time, study and career have become quite different and the older tradition is no longer acceptable now. Moreover, young adults these days choose their life partners and decide when to marry which contradicts with the old tradition.        
However, there are some traditional values that the youngsters should foster as those views are still beneficial and useful in this modern era. For instance, old generation strongly believes in the importance of being honest and they would rather die than to surrender to the corruption. If this generation can adapt to this single traditional value, the world would be a much better place. Our forefathers also valued the importance of working hard and taking pride in one’s dignity and work. These characteristics are ageless and should be passed to the new generation as well. We have become more materialistic and selfish these days while out older generation teaches us the value of family and society. The sense of community the senior people had are exemplary and would establish better family, social and cultural bonding.
It is sometimes argued that traditional lifestyles and behaviours which are favoured by the old generation have nothing to do with the training of youngsters in a way that may require living in a fast-paced world. I completely agree with this statement.
In my opinion, traditions that had been settled by our ancestors are absurd to get considered in this revolutionised world. To take a living style of our predecessors as an example, teenagers in past centuries were bound to remain in nucleus families. However, younger generations are more likely to live independently nowadays which helps them to develop a variety of attributes in their personalities ranging from a higher level of confidence and a sense of responsibility to deal with the real world. These hands-on experiences help them to be better trained and prepared for the challenges in the real world. If these offspring were forced to follow the conventional ideology, they would have missed these much-needed traits which are crucial in becoming a successful member of an egalitarian society.
It is also argued that conventional values can restrict teenagers from thinking globally. So, it will make them the narrow-minded adults in terms of accepting different people from different cultures and backgrounds. For instance, our forefathers were highly reluctant to do shared business with traders of different ethnic groups of people in their time period. This ended up in limited trades. Therefore, I would argue that teenagers should be given the broader view of this universe with immense awareness of global issues, different languages as well as conflict resolution. It will allow them to broaden their horizons in regard to the understanding of this increasingly interconnected world. As a result, a prestigious place in the job market and a prosperous future will be assured for them.
It is true that many older people believe in traditional values that often seem incompatible with the needs of younger people. While I agree that some traditional ideas are outdated, I believe that others are still useful and should not be forgotten.
On the one hand, many of the ideas that elderly people have about life are becoming less relevant for younger people. In the past, for example, people were advised to learn a profession and find a secure job for life, but today's workers expect much more variety and diversity from their careers. At the same time, the 'rules' around relationships are being eroded as young adults make their own choices about who and when to marry. But perhaps the greatest disparity between the generations can be seen in their attitudes towards gender roles. The traditional roles of men and women, as breadwinners and housewives, are no longer accepted as necessary or appropriate by the most of the younger people.
On the other hand, some traditional views and values are certainly applicable to the modern world. For example, older generations attach great importance to working hard, doing one's best, and taking pride in one's work, and these behaviours can surely benefit young people as they enter today's competitive job market. Other characteristics that are perhaps seen as traditional are politeness and good manners. In our globalised world, young adults can expect to come into contact with people from a huge variety of backgrounds, and it is more important than ever to treat others with respect. Finally, I believe that young people would lead happier lives if they had a more 'old-fashioned' sense of community and neighbourliness.
Nowadays, life has changed dramatically due to technological developments and globalizations. Many orthodox ways of spending lives have become obsolete and outdated. Some people still adhere to their traditions and cultures and are very reluctant to accept new and modern ways of lives. However, some people state that in order to compete with the current challenges, we should train our younger generation with the latest and trendy ideas.
Firstly, people used to live in the joint family system in the past decades. This gave them the opportunity to learn from their ancestors about various aspects of life. There was always a special place for elder people of the family and younger used to obey and respect them and followed their instructions in every possible. Such kind of love and respect is hard to see in modern lifestyle. Adults nowadays have become more independent, and are showing less respect towards their parents’ decisions and other aspects of life.
Secondly, there has been an element of care for their family and other members of the society in the past. Now, everyone first thinks about their own benefit and less likely to care about others. By this, I mean that new ideas contribute in making our generation selfish and egoist.
Thirdly, there is a significant change in people’s behaviour in the modern world; they have less patience while doing any work. They have become less active and more opted towards shortcuts and less mean of work.
The human being, due to the globalisation, undoubtedly have experienced a rapid change in recent years and that has impacted the way people live, interact and value old traditions to name aq few. In the bygone days, citizens adhered to the traditional ways of life and old ideas about how to face life in a different circumstance. But now, it is assumed that these ways are not very utilitarian for the adolescents in entering the modern life. Personally, I quite agree with the statement that these old ideas are not helpful in preparing the new generation to face an ever changing world in most of the cases and I have some reasons to support it which are explained in the following paragraphs.
It is believed by many that technology in the past was not as same as it is right now. This made the older generations to usually learnt how to live, think and behave in the society through the available books or by the parents and teachers.  On the contrary, now, the youngsters can learn those from provided technology such as television and the internet. This causes the idea created among them are very different in which the oldest usually has traditional thinking. For instance, the old generation has an inclination to the early marriage which is no longer a better option in modern society. The older generation also despised the use of modern technology which is quite opposite among the modern generations.  
On the other hand, nowadays, the world seems like experiencing an alteration not only in technology but also in the way people solve the occurring problem. To illustrate, the older are likely to cope the issues with sitting together and discussing but now some of the youngers have a tendency to deal with that problem via technology offered like telephone, the internet etc. This illustration makes clear that modern life is likely to use modern idea also. There is no harm in adopting and following good traditions but if that restricts the new generation from exploring potential areas, that should be avoided. For example respecting someone senior is a tradition is that young generation should still follow but accepting superstitious ideas and old traditions that deter new generations to proceed ahead should be avoided by all means. Since the people from past generation had been surrounded by the older traditions and they do not easily accept changes, I would say most of their ideas are not helpful for the upbringing and preparing a new generation to face a whole list of new challenges in life that were not present in the past.
In a nutshell, because the older generation lived in a different time and faced different types of challenges in life from that of the youngsters today, they tend to have very traditional ways to live their life and ideas which seem not convenient anymore to be utilised in the new era.
Essay 545:
Advancement in technology & people’s lifestyle has transformed human life. Have it been, entertainment, advertisement or the internet, nothing has been left untouched and the medium of transport to commute is no exception! Increasing population and number of vehicles on roads have expedited petrol consumption and this has accelerated the carbon mono oxide emission resulting global warming. I believe, government authorities must take this issue as precedence and must devise other ways to alleviate this issue.
To begin with, sophisticated scientific advances have manoeuvred manifold alternatives to travel. As a result, dwellers germinate a propensity to own their own vehicles. This shift in tendency has mounted extra pressure on the environment. For an example, as per a survey from Road transport department of India, in the year 2015, the total numbers of private vehicles have doubled in numbers. Evidently, it has raised the bar of carbon emission in the nation. Thus, the government must take an action and devise measures to mitigate the issue.
In addition, excess utilisation of petrol, diesel and other natural gases has imparted unprecedented pressure on nations. It can be corroborated by recent statistics of oil import of India, which is astounding 30% of total nation's gross domestic product. Thus, incumbency is on the government to envisage other means of travel such a battery-driven cars to curb the financial issues in the wake of excess petrol utilisation.
To sum up, it is true that people would like to use their own vehicles to commute but owing to environmental threat and economical setbacks it is vital for the authorities to devise and develop alternatives ways to commute.
Essay 546:
Nowadays companies are driven by executives and innovative ideas, which impart the impetus to the growth of a company. In the realm of innovative ideas, while many believe that only the higher management and the people with profuse experience in the industry should brain drain and envisage new ideas for the development of the organization, others, however, corroborate a strong case by claiming that ideas do not depend on the domain knowledge and year of experience and hence, even freshers or subordinates with a few years of work experience should be involved in the decision-making process of a company. Both the sides of the argument will be critiqued in the viability of the essay and an opinion will be made.
On the one hand, it is true that in this competitive world there is a little scope of mistakes in the development stratagem of a firm. Thus, the onus is on high salaried executives to sit together and envisage for the growth of the company. Moreover, the vast experience they carry with them, there is no uncertainty involved in the process. For an instance, 60% of the organisations have confirmed in a survey that 15-18 years professionals have played an indispensable role in their market capturing plans.
On the other hand, the world is transforming and ability to plan and devise innovations are not only instilled in senior executives but also it is infused in entry level employees as well. For instance, as per a magazine of innovative ideas, 70% of the startup ideas belong to freshers with age group 24-26 years. Moreover, revolutionary social networking site facebook is also framed and developed by a college fresher. Evidently, it can be confirmed that organisations should engage young brains as well in framing and producing new ideas.
To sum up, though senior employee's decision will certainly bring on stable ideas, but the world is of innovations and fresh subordinates can certainly play a paramount role in the growth of a company and subsequently a nation.
It is believed by many that decisions should only be made by senior managements for the overall well-being of an organisation. They opine that only senior employees in higher positions know the company from top to bottom and only they have experience in taking decisions in struggling moments. To a certain point, I would agree with the statement, but I also believe that leaders should also share some of the jobs to the junior leaders as someday they would be making important decisions for the company.
On the one hand, it is common that senior leaders are the ones who take decisions in a corporation. The main reason is that senior executives have passed through critical conditions with the company, so they could make wise justification and correct decision. Besides that, senior managements are the ones who will be responsible for the going concern of the corporation, which means that they must ensure that the company takes the right decision. They are trusted and proven to be wise in struggling moments of the company.  
On the other hand, it is also important for senior management to delegate some of the decisions to the junior management. Firstly, if all decisions must be made by senior executives, they will be overwhelmed and it will take sometimes for a decision to be made. In certain cases, business decisions must be taken promptly, as otherwise the opportunity will be gone. Secondly, it is also important for companies to have a regeneration program, by involving the junior executives in decision making. It will be beneficial for both the senior and junior leaders when some of the senior executives are retired and must be replaced.
In conclusion, some people believe that a company's decision should only be taken by senior management. To a certain extent, I would agree with it, as senior leaders have various experiences and they are the ones who are responsible for the company's future. But it is also important for them to delegate some of the decision-making jobs to the junior executives, as young leaders will also need to learn how to make good decisions.
Essay 548:
Ageing is a natural process happening to everyone. However, the bone of contention here is whether the life becomes easier or difficult as years pass by. In my opinion, though life seems to be challenging as we grow old, we could make it happier by making use our cognitive progression in our adult life.
On the one side, most people are of opinion that year after year, our lives get complicated. According to them, during our teenage and adolescence period, we are not carried away by worries related to family, finance and responsibilities, but as we grow older, issues like fetching a job, earning, saving, looking after our parents and children become a millstone on our shoulders. Another significant reason cited for why ageing is problematic is the age-related disorders causing physical ailments like knee and joint pains, eye problems and indigestion.
On the flip side, some people believe that ageing makes life more fruitful. They are inclined to a strong point that a man gets moulded at every stage of life and it is an essential improvement. Being immature and without worries doesn’t actually define happiness, they claim. Rather, every individual could use their natural boons such as intelligent quotient and emotional quotient as an aid to tactically solve the hurdles on their way. For instance, while we have a headache or fever, we might not know what to do during our younger ages but as we grow old we learn to take antibiotics or go to a physician. In the same way, every issue could be sorted out by everyone and life could be made happier. The freedom of decision making is a big difference in childhood and grownup time. When you grow older, you become the earning member and thus you have more freedom to take decisions. On the contrary, in childhood we rely on our parents earning and hence they take most of our decision and obliged us to follow their wish.  
Essay 549:
Globalisation, the buzzword of the modern era, has tremendously positive and negative impacts on today’s world. Some people say that the world has many urgent issues to be considered, however yet another group argues that these problems can be solved easily through the cooperation of different nations. The focus of this essay is to scrutinise the problems and solutions by economic and social perspectives and rule out the writer's opinion.
First and foremost, from the economic point of view, half of the world is facing a major financial crisis. Financial equilibrium around the world could only be possible with the help of developed countries. Very often underdeveloped countries export their natural resources in cheapest rate for costly technical products and thus fall into debt. To be clear, to resolve these debts country takes loans from World Bank and this continues as a cycle. These kinds of financial burden can be reduced by taking natural resource in the good rate by developed nations.
Secondly, when the problems are taken in social perspectives, it is huge in number. One of the main problems is crime and corruption. Increased rate of this has turned the earth into an evil planet. To be precise, the increase in population has affected the resources inversely proportional thus poverty, unemployment extra has stuck the underdeveloped world.
The environmental issues are global and no matter which countries are contributing more to pollute the world, all countries would face the consequence. Hence a global bonding and cooperation to solve such urgent issues are required. The developed countries as well as the developing and under developed countries can all work together to reduce the air and environmental pollution of the world. However, some people argue that help from different part of the world cannot solve these kinds of urgent issues from the root itself but only through the collective management of each country can bring about the changes right from the basic level or foundation. Even though helping hand given by the nations could help solve the problems but it takes time thus for a sudden change cooperation from countries will work out within time.
To sum up, solving problems are always fast and effective in a team than in individual thus nations co-operation help solve the urgent problems; the government of a country should also take a role in solving the issues which will boost the strength eradicating international problems.
Essay 550:
Technological advancement and transformation in social stature have revolutionised human life. Has it been for the application of the Internet, smartphones, bleeding-edge technological online applications, every facet of human life has been touched and impacted! These cutting edge transgressions need an educated population to utilise and enhance their lifestyle. Thus, the argument that education is mandatory for a prosperous nation holds ground on below major rationales.
To begin with, application of internet and latest communication mediums such as email and social media requires an educated people with understanding to use them. It is not possible for illiterate audiences to procure the profound usage of such devices. For an instance, as per a report from international technological advancement institute of India, smartphones and email communication has not been able to flourish in African nations where literacy level is below 20%. Evidently, it is obligatory for the citizens of a nation to be educated and aptly accept the cutting-edge technological instruments in their life and assist in the development of the nation.
In addition, natural resources in a country are limited. Admittedly, it is pivotal for the nation to exhaust them with contemplation. This is possible only when the denizens are adequately educated and informed about it is consequences: if these are not consumed with cogitation. For an instance, a nation will be able to flourish if the people are using private vehicles appropriately and as a result assisting the nation to reduce the national expenses in importing the fuel. Thus, it can be corroborated that education of the citizens is vital.
To sum up, it is true that in this world of highly extensive technology and limited fossil resources, it is mandatory for a country to devise an efficacious education system to educate people as the literate population is an imperative constituent for the development of a nation.
Essay 551:
Advancement of the world has brought tremendous development in the transportation system, but in developing and undeveloped countries, increases in private vehicles has become the main reason of traffic blocks. Some people argue that the government should take initiatives in building more roads to solve this problem but some others argue building road is not the right solution. However, I tend to agree with the latter statement that construction of new roads is not the only and proper solution for it.
First and foremost, government’s initiative to make new roads for reducing the heavy traffic in metropolitan cities is not the way but it is the wastage of government funds which should be used for the basic purpose of the society. To be precise, building new roads instead of limiting private vehicles will do no effect on traffic flow. For example, a country like India has to give more priority to the basic needs of low-income society such as in healthcare, employment, education more instead of developing road system which is of least important for the development of a country.
Moreover, one of the other reasons why it is not a right solution to build new roads is that it is wastage of land resource. To be clear, construction of new roads will take away acres of land from agriculture which affect the economy of the farmers that lead to impact the revenue of that particular place. However, the argument of building new roads to reduce heavy traffic by government is mainly because of wastage of time and fuel spent in the traffic blocks but if the same traffic can be managed by endorsing new rules to limit private vehicles and encourage and improve public transport facility which can reduce heavy traffic to a larger extent.
To sum up, after analysing the argument of building roads by public sector and the opposite view that it is not the only right solution, it is evident that if government take initiatives to control the number of private vehicles by increasing taxes and parking charges, and also by developing public transportation system it can not only control heavy traffic but also its will be a great help for the next generation by saving fuel, time and life from accidents.
Essay 552:
As the world's economy has grown considerably, earning potential amongst people has increased at a quicker rate. Besides, the advancement in technology and medical research have made it possible to cure many diseases. Thus these have enhanced people's lifestyle. Moreover, medical developments have also affected the human health condition very positively and this gives a longer life expectancy to people. Many people think that increased average life is beneficial for the society. However, others criticise it and think that this is negative for the world. In this essay, both of these views are analysed before a logical conclusion is reached.
The medical advancement, innovation and scientific research on deadly diseases have made it possible for people to live longer than the previous generations. The improved lifestyle, globalisation and better medical facilities have increased the average life expectancy in many countries. The scarcity of foods and shelter was much more in the previous generations and famine was common in the last century but not anymore. People have better lifestyle and information at their fingertips. As a result, their health condition has enhanced and so has their life expectancy.
Consequently, the ratio of the older population has increased in many countries. That creates a pressure to some extent on a country's economy. For example, countries like Japan have a huge population of 60-70 years old who cannot actively contribute towards the economic growth of the country but the government needs a huge budget to support them. This has even led to a shortage of manpower in different sectors in some countries. Moreover, the government also needs to provide schemes for elderly people like pension schemes as well as other economic benefits for them. This is often a challenge in a developing or less-developed country. Thus the negative impacts of increased life expectancy can not be ignored.
However, there are certain benefits of longer living that we must take into consideration before supporting or opposing it. For instance, If elderly people get involved in the decision-making process and in professions like politics, teaching, writing, mentoring, the country can be benefitted immensely. The older generation can pass their history, traditions and experience among the young generation and  that would always be beneficial. For instance, in Indian grandparents have a great importance while taking any important decision. Additionally, they can also be able to take care of any child of the family. Obviously, children require love, lesson, teaching and sympathy which they can get from their grandparents. From this relationship among family members can become stronger. It is quite evident that longer life has more benefits than drawbacks. The experience of older people could be used in education, politics and in other fields to enhance the overall economy of a country. Older people can give better suggestion to address a difficult situation from their experience and those experiences should be used in family and society. They preserve the manual way of living live and that has a great value to our society.
After analysing, pros and cons of longer life expectancy, it has been proved that increases life gives more benefits to the society. I, therefore, strongly oppose the viewpoint that longer life trend is negative for the society. It is hoped that this trend will be effective in foreseeable future.
Essay 553:
It is evident that the mass car ownership is associated with several environmental and health issues, including global warming, lung cancer, and anxiety. Although the convenience of possessing a car has made it almost an inexorable trend, there are measures that governments can take to discourage unnecessary car use.
The first, and also the most effective measure could be to make it expensive to own and use a car. This measure can be implemented by taxing heavily on initial car purchasing, congested roads using, and petrol consuming. By doing so, people might start considering reducing their car use, especially for the unnecessary trips. However, there is a drawback of this approach that it is often the poorer residents will suffer from the increased cost. The poor might have to cut some necessary trips because of the financial burden, whereas the rich ones would be able to maintain their convenience from car use. Therefore, this measure may be effective, but not fair to the poor.
Another way to discourage people from using their cars is to encourage them using alternative transports, such as trains, buses, and bicycles. Evidence has shown that cities, such as Tokyo and Paris, where better public transport systems are offered, car use rates are lower and roads are less congested. People will only be most willing to use public transports when they are almost or even more convenience than driving their cars. Therefore, governments could invest more in infrastructure and transport system design and construction in order to provide adequate and competitive alternatives.
To conclude, increasing the cost of having and using a car could be an effective way to reduce the car use. However, improving and encouraging the use of public transports could be the better and more sustainable way to achieve this goal.
Essay 555:
Thanks to more widely open policies in economy and immigration of many countries, the 21st century has witnessed the surprisingly increasing formation of multicultural societies where a varying number of ethnic people stay together. Although it has both positive and negative effects to a country, it seems to me that we are more likely to obtain more benefits than disadvantages from this kind of society.
The more diverse the residents of a country are, the more cultural values they can share to enhance their awareness and knowledge of culture and tradition. People will get more directly engaged in understanding unique customs or rituals, life and work attitudes from their foreign neighbours, colleagues and friends. As a consequence, they enable to adapt the cultural diversity in order to develop their interpersonal skills and live closer to other cultures without having to live in person in another country.
Additionally, once people can know more about each other through everyday interactions at work or schools, the severe conflicts or even wars will be remarkably alleviated. It is undeniable that there might have some drawbacks that multicultural communities bring to a country. Racial disparity accelerated, the wealth-poverty gap deteriorated, different culture tensions are specific cases for what are the so-called drawbacks, but the inhabitants can overcome these when the government implement friendly-ethnic peoples’ policies, as well as the dwellers, have positive thoughts and behaviours to live compatibly with others.
Stimulating multiculturalism in a society will offer numerous advantages to a country rather than undesirable effects. Therefore, each individual should savour every rewarding moment of living in their multicultural community and proudly spread their unique traditions to international friends so as to increase the diversity.
It is believed that multicultural environments bring many advantages for many people, since the variety of races, cultures and traditions will make the country become unique and attractive. Although, multicultural societies have some negative issues, but I do believe that the positive sides are greater than the negative ones.
On the one hand, countries that have multicultural communities have some similar problems. Firstly, it is common that discrimination would have been the main issue. Some groups of people feel that their races are the most superior one; therefore they would underestimate certain kinds of races. Secondly, there is always a debate about religious activities, as some groups might have extreme faith in their religions and would annoy other believers. One of the classic examples would be  the debate of religion in Israel between the Jewish and the Palestinian, which have caused so many casualties.
Despite all the drawbacks, multiculturalisms will bring many advantages for the government and the people, if they are well managed. Multicultural societies make the city become alive and fascinating, as some sides of the city shown Asiatic cultures, while on the other side it shows Western civilisations. This situation makes the city becomes unique and would attract tourists from many parts of the world. As a result, it will boost the tourism industry, create a lot of employments and generate income tax for the governments. There are many multicultural cities that are well known, such as Sydney, Toronto and Singapore and they are considered as advanced cities, due to the proper management of its local government.
In conclusion, it is undeniable that multicultural environment has its own advantages and disadvantages. In my point of view, I do believe that multicultural societies have more benefits than its drawbacks if they are managed properly by the government.
Essay 557:
The system that a country is regulated is an inherent part of it. However, sometimes it can be abused by corrupted people. Nonetheless, it does not mean this system is inefficient. By these systems, the government provides the welfare of the society.
Residents in a democratic society all need the protection of their rights. The essence of their rights is the existence the welfare and security service. For example, the government should provide general practitioners who look after all the health issues of a family for each family. And also the government should take the responsibility of the requirements of the old, the invalid and orphan children. It is also the obligation of the government to find jobs for certificated and well educated, but unemployed individuals of the country. At the same time, there should be the proper jobs they want. If it is not possible, a guaranteed minimum income should be defined for them to live comfortably.
In my opinion, abuse of the system which underlies the basis of country's policies must be prevented. It is a little difficult to avoid the abuse, but I believe some prevention measures can be taken. By this way, the system would be more reliable.
Minimum wage and earning by citizens in a democratic society reduce the discrimination and poverty and stable social condition would prevail. The minimum income also increases the social bonding as many people participate the social cause spontaneously.
Essay 558:
The leisure activities and time spent for this has plummeted in the recent decades. There are several reasons for this; such as addiction to digital gadgets and the desire to acquire materialistic prosperity. It is undeniable that this trend has serious impacts on every single person and the community as a whole.
At the outset, there are two main causes for the gradual waning of hobbies these days. Firstly, the revolutionised digital era makes people as couch potatoes in front of laptops, smartphones, the internet and social media. So obviously the citizens become less interested in carrying out an activity apart from these. Secondly, In an aspiration to achieve materialistically prosperous, they extend their working hours thereby cutting down the time spent on hobbies. For example, my uncle who has been a passionate cyclist for years hardly does cycling after being placed in one of the top multinational companies.
Incidentally, the above reasons have detrimental effects on the masses. The most significant impact on the individuals is the reduction in the physical activity. This would lead them to an unbalanced lifestyle; thereby making them the victims of diseases like high blood pressure, obesity, high cholesterol and heart attacks. This is because of the deposition of fats in the body which might naturally cause obesity after a period of time. Another connected effect is the loss of productivity in the workplace even after working for hours and hours together since the employees would deprive of ways to channelize their stress.
To conclude, the contemporary changes like digital addiction and work stress has lessened the time spent for hobbies. These trends not only cause health hazards like heart attacks and obesity but also reflected as inefficiency in work. Everyone should allocate time for the hobby that interests them. This will help them lead a stress-free and healthy life.
Essay 560:
Advancements in technology and infrastructure have revolutionised the human life and public transportation is no exception. Nowadays the government transportations are rationalised. Does it mean that the dwellers should not use private vehicles to travel? I believe, owing to excellent commutation systems worldwide, citizens should avoid using their own cars. This opinion is reliant on below arguments.
To begin with, on account of "global warming" warnings, various nations have developed a robust transport system to reduce the number of private vehicles on the road and subsequently to alleviate the greenhouse gas emissions. It can be confirmed by the environmental department's report from India. As per the statistics in the report, if the people utilise only 60% of the public transports then the pollution will reduce to 40% in metro cities. Thus, denizen must support the initiatives by travelling via public transportations.
In addition, public transports have generic dustbins to support the rubbish while travel, which may not be possible in private cars. For an example, if people commute by personal vehicles they will throw out the rubbish outside on the road, which will cause the pollution and sometimes even block the sewage system of the city. For an instance, recent sewage blockage in Mumbai, India was on account of rubbish blocking the pathway. Thus, commuting with government vehicle will assist in controlling of rubbish and assist legislators in reducing the pollution.
Essay 561:
Advancement in technology and social revolutions have opened various avenues for the humankind. People are exploring each and every viable option produced by the Earth for their livelihood and luxury. Have it been an excess utilisation of electricity, water, fertile lands for agriculture, or natural gas resources, mother earth has been exploited to a great extent! In apropos of the argument, though I agree that dwellers can spend natural resources with appropriate concoction, notwithstanding I am convinced that government must pass legislation to prevent overuse of natural resources.
To begin with, the world population has increased at a multifold rate in the past three decades, which has increased the usage of natural resources throughout the world. These are limited in quantity, so they should be used with adequate deliberation, else it is certain that the human has to live without them in coming years or so. This can be confirmed by the report from the environmental department of India that has warned the human to use water and coal in limited amount to conserve them for future. Hence, the human must act intelligently to prevent the shortage of mandatory ingredients of life.
Nevertheless, the responsibility of using the natural resources prudently should not fall only on citizens but also on a government. It is a government's duty to pass obligations to use such resources sensibly. If the lawmakers can pass proper laws to save the mother planet, then residents will certainly follow it. Evidently, it will help optimise the expenditure of natural constituents. For instance, nobody would use personal vehicle to commute if the government had the provision of fine on using them. Thus, the cabinet must control the overexploitation using their lawmaking ability.
Essay 562:
Human is a social being. However, in the recent years, owing to terrorism and increment in the violence, characteristic of human as a friendly species is transforming. Some people believe that similar to ancient times, even today sports events extenuate the global riots and assist in maintaining the harmony. I believe, it is true and it must flourish across the globe.
To begin with, worldwide game events redirect the focus of every nation towards the preparation of the event. As a result, the global show off of supremacy is alleviated. It can be confirmed by the recent world cup event whereby, total worldwide violence was reduced to 10%. Thus, on account of these statistics, it is evident that global game events are propitious to the world.
In addition, due to sport, majority of the nations cross borders and play with each other, which sometimes pave the way for negotiations among the nations and impart the impetus to a mutual agreement. For instance, in the recent cricket tournament, the Prime Minister of India and Pakistan had inked an agglomeration to fight against terrorism. Evidently, prominence of game events in mitigating the global issues cannot be neglected. Sports events are friendly competitions that bring the sportsmen and the nations together.  A major victory in a large completion has proven to reduce the international tension and difference. Many times these short of winning lessen the internal political issues a country has. When sports events get popular, young people get attracted to participate in sports rather than doing crime activities. From this point of view, sports play a great role to bring nations together and reduce the crime and violence.
Essay 563:
In the wake of globalisation and technological advancements, people have abundant opportunities to excel in their career and earn more money. Have it been political, engineering or medical regime, every professional is participating in the race of competitive markets! Does it mean human has transformed into a materialistic creature? This is a subject of dissension. In apropos of the argument, I am in a consummate accord with it and I believe denizens prefer luxury and lavishness and they are happy to sacrifice humanity for it.
To begin with, nowadays people are educated than ever and competitive as well. However, there are lesser jobs to employ individuals. Thus, lack of demand has made the competition among people imperative and as a result, they have lost humanitarian values and converted materialistic. For an instance, as per a survey by the human values department in the USA, 70% of people confirmed to give up human values for higher growth opportunities. Admittedly, it can be contended that people prefer future prospects to moral and human values.
In addition, development of manifold electronic and daily usage gadgets have germinated a desire of prosperity among dwellers. Everyone is keen to furnish their homes with new furniture, latest electronic devices to stamp out their place as an emblem of richness. Evidently, it has developed a mindset of materialistic attainment among the denizen.
To conclude, owing to technological and social revolution, it is evident that the humankind is transforming in nature and this phenomenon will go on due to the development of new products and human's accelerating desire to own them.
Essay 565:
Nowadays, youngsters are engaging in delinquent activities, which cause pressure in the society. It can be ascribed to the lack of parental supervision and the negative influences of peers. However, this social problem can be tackled by the employers and parents.
Primarily, is it often said that youngsters may opt to negative vices if parents do not monitor their activities. Evidently, there are parents who have a hectic schedule in their workplace, thus neglecting the responsibilities to their children. Because of inadequate guidance, these youngsters socialise with other people in the society. For instance, in school, children develop a relationship with their friends as it is considered their second home. A group of friends shares the same habits and passions such as venturing to illegal substances and criminal behaviours. It might be their way to retaliate to their parents, who do not spend time with them. These children may eel resentment due to the fact that they might have the feeling of being unloved and unwanted. Therefore, they will perform nefarious actions such that they will gain the attention of their parents, and make them regretful for being preoccupied to their employment.
However, it can never be denied that this social dilemma can be addressed by the parents and the employers. First of all, parents can give more attention to their children by having a weekly family outing to different places. For example, they could eat together in a luxurious restaurant or watch a movie in order to regain the aloof relationship. These parents can show to their children that they are important despite their busy schedule. Secondly, employers can curtail the employment hours of those employees who have children. As a result, these workers can spend more time with their children.
To conclude, there is an escalation of crimes conducted by youngsters, who have a lacking in supervision from their parents. Nevertheless, it is apparent that managers can help those employees, who have children, to allocate more time to their family. It is very likely that frequent family bonding can eradicate the negative behaviours of their children. 
Essay 567:
Learning the English language in a country where people speak English is a very advantageous option, although not the only way. Personally, I completely agree with this statement, because living in English spoken country has a lot of benefits in terms of mastering this language.
Learning English is easier in an English-speaking country because the people around you are speaking English and makes it easy to adjust to English accent and also sentence patterns. For instance, it is very hard to learn English accent without listening to English. Besides living in English speaking country will enrich your vocabulary and grammar and that enhancement will occur spontaneously. And you can ask anything about the language that you have doubts about. You are bound to speak in this language and that would give you an excellent opportunity to enhance your speaking skill.
On the other hand, it is not the only way to learn a language. There are a lot of books that you can utilise. English radio programmes or TV shows are best options to learn the language. So, it will help you increasing your listening skills. In addition, nowadays, the internet is widespread and also a superiority in our world. Thereby, the internet comprises all kind of information and it will help you about your doubts. It is evident that there are enough programmes for speaking with somebody in which it will improve your speaking skills.
I would agree that people who live in a country like Canada, USA, UK or Australia, where English is used as the primary way of communication, would help them master this language pretty quickly and accurately. But not always you need to live there to learn this language. It is not uncommon for people who have never been in an English speaking country to have an excellent command over this language. Some of the poets and writers who wrote successful English literature have been born and raised and lived in non-English- speaking countries.  
The English language is an international language which dominates almost all relationships between countries. Therefore important people need to speak the English language fluently. In addition, simple people should know English. Firstly it is good to be able to speak another language as well as your mother tongue. And also when you visit an English-speaking country, you will need to know English. Learning English while living in a country like UK, USA, Australia, Canada etc. is a very good option but in my opinion, there are other effective ways to learn it as well.
I think studying the English language is now more different than studying other languages. In these days English is educated in most countries across the world. Furthermore, every person, who has the internet accessibility at their house, has a great alternative to acquiring knowledge of speaking English. The internet provides a great deal of opportunity to study English on the chair you sit. Moreover today the English lessons are taught on the internet as efficient as they are taught in the class.
But of course, the best and the most efficient way of studying the English language is still to live and spend most of your time in an English-speaking environment. By this way, you are induced to speak and study English with its actual speakers. If there is a chance to study English in an English-speaking country, it is the best scope that a person can ever have.
However, in my opinion, it is not the only opportunity to study English. Because there are good enough programs that are applied by well-educated teachers all around the world. All you need is the perseverance that induces to hardworking. Thereby you can study whatever you want wherever you are by trying hard.
There is no doubt that large numbers of people are travelling English speaking countries to pursue their education. Some people argue that foreign countries have more modern and latest teaching methodologies and have trained and professional staff to educate students. Students also get an opportunity to interact with local people that will help them to improve their communication skills in English. Others claim that people can also learn English in their country effectively and efficiently by using online resources, exploring books, visiting libraries and taking help from teachers. I believe that foreign countries immensely help to achieve desired langue skills.
Nowadays, English has become an essentials constituent of the educational curriculum in non-English speaking countries, all institutions have adopted this change because of its undeniable benefits. Government and private sectors are making efforts to train their people in English by providing them various learning options that are easy and cheaply available within the country.
On the other hand, learning in foreign countries is more convenient. One of the reasons is that being pioneer, they are well aware of the art of delivering knowledge and other learning techniques. Furthermore, people will get the chance to meet and communicate with local people and explore their cultures, that will help them in understanding language more.
To sum up, I would like to say that studying and living in foreign country dramatically increased their knowledge and information about the language, which would be rather difficult and less effective in their native nation. However, accommodation, food and medical expenses could impede one’s dedications towards learning in English speaking country.
Essay 568:
With the rapid development of architectural advancements and the dramatic increase in modernization, many countries have allowed constructing more and more modern buildings that have created significant changes in character and appearance of the living areas. In my opinion, this is unlikely to deteriorate culture and the suggestion that new high-rise buildings should follow the traditional styles in order to maintain culture identity is not persuasive.
There is no denying the fact that buildings erected in modern and unique designs and equipped with more advanced amenities will partly make a professional and active look for a city or town, which both facilitates higher living standards of the locals and draws attention to wealthy tourists or potential investors who are seeking for lucrative markets to develop their business. When the government implement the open policies for its cities and towns to construct modern buildings, many companies are more likely to rent more rooms, offices or apartments so as to place their branches, stores or even head offices. This will promisingly accelerate the local economy.
With the intention to protect cultural identity, the government can take consideration into more practical ways rather than insist the traditional styles for new buildings. Regular repairs or refurbishment for historical and old buildings, for instance, may be a good idea to keep the country's cultural values alive longer. It is those sites that reflect more actual traditions of towns and cities than new ones built in the so-called traditional styles which people cannot ensure if they have been inherited properly from the previous to present builder generation.
In conclusion, modern buildings are obvious results of the constant progress in construction techniques and the economic development of residential regions. The government should encourage building more high-rise buildings to satisfy its inhabitants' higher demands on hi-tech facilities as well as invest effectively in repairing old buildings to conserve traditional values.
Essay 570:
Traditionally men and women work in different fields. Though they have always worked together to build a better world, a subtle difference has always been there in the types of employment they have done. The modern world has changed this perspective to a great extent despite some people’s old-fashioned views that a woman should look after the family and a man should be the bread winner. In my view, gender equality is far more important than considering which sectors are more suitable for a particular gender and which are not.
Some people might present traditional arguments regarding the suitability of some posts for females and some others for male, but the modern era teaches us otherwise. In fact, greater freedom of choice in terms of employment can accelerate the development of a nation than the old way of distributed work pattern. For instance, it is believed by many that a female is more suitable for a profession that requires tenderness and caring while men are more adept in doing tasks those demand more physical strength. Thus, according to their opinion, more women should become nurses or teachers than males while logging, mining, and construction works should be solely done by males.
However, making occupations more open to both genders have distinctive advantages and in certain cases, mixed-gender work environment outperforms the single-sex workplace. For instance, having an all-female hospital is quite challenging and not a pragmatic idea at all. Men and women can bring diverse perspectives and approaches to a job and a school with both male and female teachers has better teaching environment than a single-sex-teacher one. It is quite logical that a female patient would feel more comfortable to consult with a female doctor while a female police would better understand the domestic violence and bring superior strategies for dealing with the problems. Though traditional view does not support women to become doctors or police, we can definitely understand their needs.
To conclude, innovation and advantages the gender equality in job sectors can bring is far-reaching and have greater benefits for the society. The time has come for us to break the traditional and outdated belief of gender-suitable-profession. 
Essay 571:
It is evident that the gender gap is closing in the vast majority of occupations in today’s society. However, some remain with the opinion that females and males are born to have differences in terms of their vocational preferences. Despite this, I would argue in this essay that it is wrong to exclude a certain gender from a certain occupation.
It is undoubtedly true that a certain gender could be more appreciated in some professions. It is mainly determined by the biological differences between males and females. For example, females are perceived to be more caring and nurturing by nature, so that they could be more suitable working in nurseries and hospitals; whereas, males are more likely to be employed in mining and construction industries because they are physically stronger. In those cases, the gender gap may remain in the short future.
However, for the vast majority of professions, making occupations more open to both genders has significant advantages. Different genders could bring different perspectives into work, which could generate more possibilities for a company’s development. For example, a male nurse could offer his unique experience to a female-dominated team in order to promote a more holistic care to patients in both genders. Moreover, there is evidence that a mixed-gender working environment is often proven to be more efficient. Therefore, companies could benefit from the different perspectives and efficiency that mixed gender teams bring.
To conclude, although some occupations remain to be female or male dominant, there are more advantages to allowing both genders have the freedom of their vocational choices. Companies that facilitate this equality could benefit from the increased possibilities and efficiency.
Essay 572:
It is generally believed that in some cases, males and females have difference ability, skill weakness, limitations and natural talents, especially in a workplace. I am of the belief that they should be distinguished for certain work fields. Assigning the right person in the right place would enhance performance and increase the profit and productivity. I would explain two examples to reinforce my view.
Initially, women tend to be more patient in teaching toddlers and adolescences than men. In addition, women better understand what children want and like. Moreover, it is common that woman teachers are higher in number than male teachers in nursery and primary schools. This strength could be best used if women have had more opportunities in teaching children, nursery or any fields that relate to the teaching and interacting with the toddler. Likewise, female are naturally caring and nursing is a great profession for them. It is not uncommon that we can see more female nurses in hospitals that their male counterparts. So from this regards, I agree that some professions are more suitable for female whereas others are to men. Providing that gender base priority in some professions is not a bad idea at all.
Another example is male’s natural strength. On an average, men are physically stronger than women. For example, generally labours are mostly males as this job requires hard work and physical strength. The work fields that require more physical strength could be reserved for male employees. Likewise in many jobs employees need to work at night and work publicly which might be inconvenient for female employees in many countries. For such jobs, males should be given priority, I believe.
Lastly, men tend to use their logic first but women use their feeling first. Meanwhile, men like extreme challenges than women. Mining in offshore is one of the professions that need logic, bravery, and physical strength at the same time. Men are suitable for doing this job because not only for those requirements but also the commitment to work overtime.
To sum up, it is right to exclude men or women in certain work fields. People work based on their passion and ability. Educational background, enthusiasm, skill, talent and suitability can increase the performance and some jobs could be more suitable for male while others for female.
Nature has made males and females with a different set of characteristics and these contrasts in feature make them adept at certain tasks, according to the common belief of the society. However, in this era, when gender equality has already been accepted and both males and females proved that they can be equally fit in any job, excluding a certain gender from a particular profession is no longer an acceptable and wise option.
To begin with, according to the common social dogma, women should stay at home, take care of the kitchen and up-bring children while men should have a career, earn money and take important decisions for the family. Though this was a widely accepted idea in the past, it has started changing and women in certain professions have outnumbered their male counterparts. For instance, the number of female teachers has already exceeded the number of male teachers in many countries according to an online report. On the other hand, men have proven that they can be as good as females in child care and nursing. The time has come to forget the old dogma and accept the fact that gender equality is longer an option, but a must in job sectors. Women are no longer ready to be confined within the walls while males have forgotten their prejudices and started switching the roles.
Furthermore, while selecting someone for a job, the authority should look for a suitable candidate and that person can be either a male or female. The widely held belief that women are less suitable in professions that require physical strength, logical reasoning, mental power, diplomacy and dealing with others is no longer acceptable in the society. Many female presidents and prime ministers in the world have proved that it is a baseless theory and tech giants lie Google, Microsoft, Facebook and Yahoo! Do not employ people based on their gender, rather they put more emphasis on someone’s quality and potential.
To draw a conclusion to the discussion, despite some physical differences, both men and women have similar talents and possibility. The old dogma of gender-based role is no longer tolerable in the modern era and this is why someone’s talent and skill should be the primary reasons for the suitability for a job, not the gender of the candidate. 
Throughout the history, a difference could be observed in the type of jobs men and women have done. However, this old belief that categorises men and women for certain jobs has changed in the modern era and these days, both genders have a greater freedom to choose a career. Some people might possess the old dogma in this regard, I personally, however, believe that gender equality must be encouraged.
One group of thought advocates that male are physically stronger and have less vulnerability while working in a group of people while females are better caretakers and soft-hearted. This is why, according to them, certain works like logging, coal mining and construction works are more suitable for men while teaching, cleaning and nursing should be done by females. While all-female or all-male employee concept is supported by some, I think a balanced workplace, where an equal number of men and women work together, is more suitable in terms of social, economic and gender equality perspectives.
It is more practical to make occupations open to both sexes as it has distinctive advantages. Due to a slightly different way of dealing an event by men and women in general, having both male and female employees in an organisation brings more innovations and open new opportunities. For example, a female police officer may have a greater understanding of domestic violence and a better range of strategies for dealing with the problem while a male nurse can better judge the need of a male patient in a hospital.
Essay 573:
Globalisation and metropolitan cultures have revolutionised human life. Have it been for shopping malls, various food chains and extreme sports centres, people have numerous alternatives to enjoy and release the stresses! In apropos of the argument, I am consummate accord with it and I believe that young adults lead an interesting and adventurous life. This opinion is surrounded by various arguments.
To begin with, in the wake of available alternatives nowadays, adolescences live a life, which allows them to explore and learn. Youngsters have handy and useful options such as the internet, social media, high-resolution video games, shopping malls, where they can hang out with friends and enjoy anytime. For an instance, as per a report from a leading advertisement agency, 90% parents agreed that children have numerous viable options to engage in, which were not possible in pre-globalization era. Moreover, technological gadgets and social media are majorly intricate to use for old people. Thus, aged people cannot utilise these entertainment mediums and enjoy.
In addition,  youngsters of the twenty-first century are adventurous and they have a proclivity to perform various extreme sports. In other words, adults participate in high voltage sports such as jumping, skating, paragliding etc., which is never possible for old people.  It can be confirmed by a survey done by extreme sports body in the USA. As per the survey, 90% of the adventure sports are executing only because of people less than 30 years of age. Evidently, aged people are not capable and fit enough to enjoy these sports.
Biologically young people have a sound body and much enthusiasm than the people in old ages. The sound body and inquisitive mind are two main ingredients to lead a happy and enjoyable life. In this regard, young people lead a better life than older people.
To sum up, I am convinced that technological development and adventure sports have opened multiple new avenues of entertainment for youngsters, which are not feasible for the old people to participate in. Thus, young adults have more alternatives to lead an entertaining life and they utilise it overwhelmingly.
Essay 574:
Smoking has been prohibited inside some companies whereas in few countries it has been totally banned in all the public places. It is agreed that this is an appropriate action because serious consequences of smoking in working areas and in public may lead to fire accidents and heath hazards to self and society.
A strong argument could be put forth that smoking should not be allowed in certain work environments. For instance, if there is a lapse of security in an oil and natural gas company like Indian Oil Corporation, then it has to face the ramifications since the probability for fire accidents becomes higher. So the ban imposed is considered to be a right method not only to thwart the resources from being depleted but also to save the lives of the workers from such disaster.
Moreover, if smoking is banned in all public places of the country then obviously the overall health of the masses would be improved. Since it becomes a legal issue, if they disobey the rules, people might gradually become de-addicted. For illustration, my uncle decided not to smoke in public amenities like bus stops and railway stations instead of paying a huge amount of fine. Naturally, life-threatening diseases like lung cancer and asthma could reduce and the number of passive smokers might also decline. Eventually, the future citizens of the country are made healthier which would be reflected as their efficiency, productivity and enthusiasm thereby paving way for the country's development.
In conclusion, banning smoking either in business sectors or all public places, both are undeniably a wise remedial act because the job environment is made safer and the people are encouraged to lead a healthy lifestyle which in turn contributes to the overall growth of the country. Though smokeless future seems to be skeptical but it could be made possible with joint efforts of all the individuals.
Essay 576:
According to the Ecological Systems Theory, the environment that a person lives in has the most significant influence on his/her personal development. Some argue that certain personal traits are closely associated with a person’s achievement. However, I will argue in this essay that social equality is the key to an individual’s success in general from two aspects: gender equality and education equality.
The roles that women play in societies often vary significantly among different regions of the world. Societies, that offer women more freedom in terms of educational and vocational choices, could possess more desirable opportunities to facilitate women in pursuing their dreams and achieving their potentials. Women in Australia, for example, where the equality between males and females is considerably advance, could be more likely to achieve higher personal successes than women in Pakistan where females often remain inferior than males in society.
Education equality is another effect that could largely influence on one’s accomplishment. As human society develops, the ability of literacy and the access to modern technologies become increasingly important in individuals’ personal development. Residents of regions where free fundamental education and better access to technologies, such as the internet and computers, are provided, could have increasing numbers of opportunities to exercise their personal traits, thus, to succeed in the fields of their choices.
To conclude, an egalitarian society can facilitate more achievements among individuals. The gender and education equalities are two fundamental ones that could ensure everyone in the society, both males and females, to have the relatively equal opportunity to succeed.
Essay 577:
The concern and ongoing debate in the relationship between equality and personal success have developed recently. Some are convinced that individuals have marvellous opportunities to gain their success in egalitarian societies where everyone is treated in the same manner no matter what their educational, economical and intellectual levels are. While the opponents conceive that the high level of attainment will happen only if the individuals are free to achieve both the success and failure based on their own capabilities. I entirely believe that there is a strong connection between equality and personal success and this essay aims to elaborate that the egalitarian society is the best option for people.
As the era is developing, some aspects among the general public are changing and equality is one of those aspects. The concept of equality has been spread in the whole world and it results in many successes in egalitarian communities. Egalitarian gives fantastic chance to people to gain their achievement since there is no restriction for people in order to reach their success. In this situation, skill and knowledge are the main factors to achieve it. In Indonesia, for example, it was hard for women to have positions in certain sectors such as politics and military because most people were convinced that it was not appropriate for women to become either politician or a defence personnel. Yet, as the people is more open-minded now, it is no longer an issue and women can achieve their success in any sectors based on their ability. Thus, the egalitarian trend has influenced the society’s achievement.
Besides, equal rights and opportunities trigger people to become more competitive in a positive way and have more spirit to achieve something. Furthermore, people can get motivation from their surrounding that has similar objectives. In a classroom, for instance, every pupil has the same rights to be the champ without be differentiated by the teacher. While the students are surrounded by spirited fellows, they will learn better. In this case, having equal opportunities and rights urge people to gain the best achievement. Therefore, egalitarian concepts provide more chance to every people to become successful.
In conclusion, In conclusion, equality motivates people to work together and help each other. In a society where discrimination is present, even based on people’s capability, greater good can never be achieved.
Essay 579:
With the advancement in technology and globalisation, every facet of life has transformed and food habits are no exception. Since the beginning of recorded time, people are known hunters, on account of their necessity to food; however, with the revolution in civilisation, there are vehement disputes on prohibiting non-vegetarian cuisine. I believe, meat is an indispensable component of our diets and must not be banned. This opinion is surrounded by various rationales.
To begin with, food items prepared by animal's flesh are known for nutritious ingredients that are almost denied in vegetables. Admittedly, the profuse quantity of unsaturated fats such as Omega-3 is found in red meat only. Broadly speaking, Omega-3 is only fat which is not dissolvable in the body and it is propitious for human health. Thus, eroding non-vegetarian from diets is not beneficial. In addition, animals are vital constituents of the food cycle. Evidently, wilds are a major component of food cycle on earth; therefore they must be utilised to maintain the appropriate balance in the cycle. For an instance, if wild animals are removed from the cycle, the earth will become abundant with animals which may be harmful to nature. Moreover, turning vegetarian will require almost 1/3 of the earth's vegetation to be utilised per year.Thus, migrating towards non-vegetarian food is not providential for earth and denizens.
To sum up, on account of the availability of highly nutritious elements and its presence in food-cycle, it is broadly impossible to remove meat from diet and it's utilisation in diet must be encouraged to retain the natural habitat of earth.
Essay 580:
In the earlier days, the educators could deliver lectures to a group of students in one classroom but now with the boom in technological advancement, it is getting harder to state reasons for their physical presence. It is agreed that it is difficult for justifying the reasons to be physically present in such gatherings while there is an alternative option, the internet.
The primary reason for this is that the time flexibility of online classes. The scholars might schedule their own time to learn the subjects taught since the digitalized academic materials facilitate the saving for reviewing it later. To illustrate, the tutors could either record their lessons and upload in YouTube or send links to tutees' email address or even post in students' common login page. These easily accessible options were not under limelight until the emergence of the internet.
Another connected reason is the possibility to access many experts at one time. Even if the novice is about to attend the lecture directly, there is less chance for him to meet many educators at the same place but with recent application software like Google hangout, it has become facile to gather knowledge from different people of the same field of study.
To conclude, while there is a better option to choose from with the advent of technology, learners tend not to get inclined to other choices. Unless there is a mandatory need to get enrolled for the lectures in person, undoubtedly they prefer online classes. My personal viewpoint is that this way of updated learning has become more useful because of the ease provided to manage their time properly. Thus e-classrooms and tuitions are better to be preferred by the students of this modern era.
Essay 582:
Families, which form the base for socialisation, are not as bonded as they had been in earlier days. It is undeniable that the bonding between the members of the family is weakening gradually during the course of time.
The primary reason is time spent together with the family has shrunk. In the rat race to achieve materialistic prosperity, everyone in the family started working in different places, so it is quite evident that they hardly have quality time with each other. For instance, if both parents in a family are the breadwinners then it is obvious that their words would be left aloof most of the time. Thus the space left for love and affection to blossom in such a nuclear family has become less frequent.
Another connected reason is the addiction to electronic gadgets .This contemporary world drives people to become technophilic. Despite having leisure time, these days it appears that it is not well spent with the loved ones because of laptops and smartphones. This is because these gadgets have access to the internet which in turn opens ways for social networking sites like Facebook and YouTube. Thus there is a larger probability that the citizens might get hooked and engrossed .Since these consume more time, the time spent with family has lessened.
With regard to the suggestions to bind the families together, it is recommended that if everyone decides to be with their family every weekend then definitely it would compensate the time they worked round the clock throughout the week. Therefore, in my opinion, this weekend bonds might even make individuals emotionally more attached to other members of the family and could strengthen their relationship.
To conclude, most of the populaces are deprived of time for spending with their families either because of aspiration for materialism or addiction to gadgets .This has made a dramatic change that the family members are not as closer to each other like years ago, so it is suggested to spend weekends with family to make up their relationship.
Essay 584:
The people of the Modern world are always in search of new enjoyments and new attractions. While drugs are lifesavers when they are taken for the health issue and prescribed by the doctors, it can also be fatal if taken for temporary amusement. Many special drugs, pills and similar things of that kind are abused by young people and it is a big threat to the future of next generations of the society.
This habit starts with smoking and end in fatal addiction in some seriously addictive substances. Because it is legal for the teenagers who are above the age of 16 in many crowded countries or smoke, they start smoking. Then, the issue gets worse and youth want to experience more powerful substances for temporary joy and excitement.
A large number of practitioners think it is mainly the fault of parents and responsible relatives or friends. Because youth mostly take examples from them, any bad habit of parents would greatly influence the youth. The family disparity can very negatively affect youth and many times they abuse drugs to get read of the reality or complexity. If parents smoke and drink alcohol, the young children might adapt this habit easily.
Another peril is the people and friends with whom young people live and spend time. The groups of teenagers who abuse drugs might induce the innocents. A big cause of widespread drug use is exactly the influence of the environment and friends. Although well-mannered parents send their children to schools to get some quality educations and cultures, in some schools the drug abusers induce them to do wrong things.
In my opinion, some prevention measures have to be taken for the welfare of youth. School authority and teachers should make them well disciplined and manage a nice and rigid system in schools that would prevent young children to proceed to wrong ways. The government should make sure that the illegal substances and drugs are not available and should make sure no young people can get it without the authorised prescriptions and parental guidance. Parents should be more attached to their kids and should live ideal life to set an example for your kids.
Essay 585:
It is true that although the internet has facilitated us in many ways like gifting us a globalisation where this world is now being referred to as a small village but it is also true that it has created many problems too.  In this fast paced technologically high world where parents do not have enough time to look at the activities of their small kids because of their busy schedule, small children also have access to the internet easily. They are exposed to many things on the internet which are not suitable for them. They are learning many things which are not good for them to learn at their age.
In addition to this, the internet has also created problems in the financial world also. Nowadays, people are being misguided in a way that many hackers, spammers, and digital fraud make people fool. For example, my friend is being made fool by one of the hackers on the internet. He has asked him to register with a website which can give assistance to go abroad and for registration he has to pay online. He has given his credit card number. His credit card number is being used by the hacker and he made a lot of transactions from his credit card number.
Moreover, In addition to these disadvantages, the internet has also made people far away from each other. In today's world, people are not interacting with each other because they get too busy in their lives. Instead of meeting with each other personally, people prefer to get in touch with each other through internet only.
Essay 586:
There are strong arguments that the authority of the company must plan their actions towards the success of their business. However, some individuals are convinced that employees must participate in the strategy of a company.
Primarily, it is often said that the authority of the company is the one who invested most of the fund in their company. Some of the chief executive officers have started from small scale business industries before they reach the highest success of their companies. In other words, they have a number of managerial experiences which they could apply to proliferate their income. Hence, they do not need the advice of the employees as they might have different skills on other fields, which are not suitable for deciding better actions in a company. For instance, a computer programmer who works in a private institution may not contribute to the decisions about financial management. Furthermore, the fundamental purpose of business owners is to recover their recover the capital they invested in their companies. To illustrate, in a supermarket, most goods being sold are important because the earnings will be used to supplement the products, which sustain the continuity of a business.
However, it can never be denied that the employees are part of a company. It is their privilege to contribute to the success of a company due to the fact that they will benefit from its monetary gain. As an instance, the employer might increase their salary because they made the greatest contribution to the improvement of business. Hence, their collaboration will bring favourable benefits to them, which may strengthen the teamwork and collaboration. Moreover, it is apparent that more ideas are imperative to the management of a business. It is possible that the owner of the company could commit erroneous decisions, which may be corrected by some workers such as staffing and scheduling in an institution.
To conclude, I personally believe that employees must partake to the plans of a company as the authority might sometimes create irrational actions. It is very likely that if the employer and the worker merge their ideas, they will receive a propitious success.
Essay 588:
Rich people, for any privileged healthcare service, should turn to private healthcare facilities and the public healthcare facilities should equally treat the citizens regardless their wealth and status. If affluent people are given priority in a public-funded medical care, the poor would be deprived of their rights to get medical treatment and that is why I totally disagree with the notion that the exclusive healthcare in public funded system should be given to those who can pay more money.
To begin with, a government has an obligation to ensure healthcare service for all of its citizens. If better medical services in a public funded system are for sell, it would only degrade the overall healthcare service in a country and symbolise a weak and corrupt administration. Furthermore, any public service, including healthcare, is run by taxpayers' money and offering exclusive services to rich people would create a backdoor for corruption. Similarly, it would deprive citizens of getting the service at all as rich people would start consuming the whole facility.   
With regards to prioritise medical service, only rich people can afford that and most of the poor cannot even think of getting it. So, only an autocratic government whose sole purpose is to make money and exercising power rather than serving the people would plan to actually execute such a detrimental and whimsical plan. Having said that, the private funded exclusive and expensive medical facilities are always there and wealthy people can avail this service for them anytime they want. This is why adopting money-can-buy-better-service in a public funded healthcare system is perhaps the step to destroy a fair medical service in a country.
To conclude, health care is a sensitive sector and any policy that can reduce its overall quality of service should always be discarded. In my personal opinion, and I am sure it would also reflect the opinion of the majority in my country, prioritised medical service in a public funded settlement should never be implemented as it has a severe negative effect that would hinder poor people from getting healthcare facilities at all.
Essay 590:
In the modern world, when women rub shoulders with men in every field, it is a moot issue that women should take equal responsibilities in the army. This essay would discuss that men are more suitable in the army and my viewpoint accord with that. Males have more physical strength and emotional maturity, which is necessary for a non-civilian.
Firstly, jobs in warfare and armed forces require physical fitness. Handling sophisticated machines and weapons need body strength. Men are more powerful than women; it facilitates men for to do jobs easily and quickly. Furthermore, different geographical condition and climatic conditions need to be faced and the weak body cannot tolerate this. In addition, sometimes warfare soldiers cannot get enough foods; it forced them to continue their job with starving body, which makes difficult for women to work.
Secondly, the fair sex is emotionally weak. Men are aggressive and fearless which require for a soldier to take decisions and fight. Moreover, women are submissive and tender-hearted, which are leads to run away from the battlefield rather than fighting. Women will try to safeguard their position, whereas, men are selfless and very dominating.  This emotional immaturity makes women as a bad warrior.
Essay 591:
Since the beginning of the recorded time, people have been exploring natural resources to fulfil their needs. Has it been water, coal to burn fire and cook, crude oil to commute from one place to other, dwellers have been exploring avenues to live in; consequently these are on the verge of annihilation. Apropos of the argument, I am in consummate accord with it and I believe that people should refrain from scavenging and envisage alternative sources. This opinion is surrounded be several arguments as below.
To begin with, over exploration of soil is a threat to the environment. In other words, various exploration programs are causing depletion of soil; as a result, it has resulted in numerous global catastrophes. For an instance, as per a report from a renowned coal mining magazine, 60% of the natural catastrophes are taking due to imbalance created by mining. Thus, digging earth for minerals should be prevented as soon as possible.
In addition, utilization of coal and crude oil for generation of electricity produces harmful gases. Byproducts after burning coal and crude oil are treacherous, in particular, carbon monoxide, which is the major constituent of swelling global warming. Recently, environment scientists have confirmed in a monthly magazine that human must migrate to renewal energy sources owing to the severe level of poisonous gases such as CO, H2S, HCN in the atmosphere germinated by utilizing fossil fuels.
To conclude, extraction of earth must be prevented as soon as possible to alleviate natural disasters due to imbalance is the environment. Likewise, the human must shift their focus to renewal energy to maintain the oxygen level on the earth.
Essay 593:
Advancement in technology and globalisation have transformed each facet of life and revolution is family structure is no exception. In the wake of various job opportunities people have migrated to other nations as a result concept of nuclear family has carved the cliche in the community. It has germinated a vehement argument that who should take care of old age people at home. Though I am convinced that parents have brought up the children and now is the time for them to pay the debt, but I disagree that it is only family’s responsibility and the government should not devise measures for the benefit of parents.
To begin with, it is widely claimed that children are nothing without parents. Parents as guardian have taught everything from speaking to walking. Evidently, children should look after parents when they become old as it is not only a moral responsibility but also it is the duty as a son or daughter.
On the flip side, I also agree that government must take adequate measures to assist old age people. On account of increasing social equality husband and wife both are working professionals in demanding work environments. Thus, looking after parents has become impossible. Moreover, relying on children will not be helpful for old age people as they will end up cooking foods and babysitting their grandchildren. Therefore, the cabinet must pass bills to facilitate old dwellers with monthly pensions and old age houses to help them in their difficult time. The old people have contributed to the country in many ways including paying the tax and the government should ensure their proper care from the fund the country has or from the money it collects from the taxpayers.
Essay 594:
First world countries are the most developed countries as oppose to 3rd world countries which are least developed.The financial gap between the two sides is increasing with every passing day. I strongly agree that developed nations have an ethical and moral obligation to support the underdeveloped countries in every possible way.
It is a known fact that world economy is being controlled by developed countries. There exist the forums like G8 which consist of top eight developed countries of the world. Global economic policies are being made during their meetings which drive the world economy. While making the policies at the highest stage of the world, members of developed countries should keep in mind the poverty in developing and under developed countries. The wealth gap between the developed and developing countries can be reduced by making economic policies which are friendly and least hostile towards the developing countries.
Apart from the policies, it is also a moral and ethical duty of developed countries to support the underdeveloped countries. A development project in an underdeveloped country will not only provide a way of growth but also create many new jobs for the local public. Similarly, Governments and NGOs of the rich countries should provide financial aid in the field of education, health, energy, etc. This will also help in reducing the wealth gap along with the development of the poor and needy nation.
In the end, it is concluded that financial and wealth gap can be reduced by making good economic policies, by investing in the development projects and by providing the financial aid. Rich countries and rich people should provide assistance to poor countries and poor people respectively.
Essay 595:
With the use of one global currency, there will be many benefits in travelling and cross-border business. I agree with the statement that trade and travel would be a lot easier with the use of one global currency. However, there might be some problems. Let’s discuss the pros and cons.
When thinking of one currency, everyone points to the Euro. It is a common currency which is being used in multiple countries of Europe. European citizens and other tourists travelling to Europe don’t have to carry multiple currencies. Only one currency works in such countries and people don’t bother about the exchange rates as well. Similarly, global deals of business and trade will be straight forward as this will be without the fluctuation of forex rates. The conversion hassle and global acceptance of a currency would be reduced and some monopoly in trading would be reduced.
Although, the idea of global currency is very appealing but there might be some issues in its implementation at the global level. There are more than 200 countries and each has its own currency. No two currencies have the same exchange rate. During the crossborder deals, the forex difference plays a vital role. With the use of one single currency, countries having higher exchange rates with respect to other will be at receiving end and have to bear the deficit.
In the end, it is concluded that one global currency is beneficial for the general public. But there would be challenges in its implementation. Once the problems and issues are resolved, it would be a lot easier for the business community as well as for the travellers and tourists.
Essay 596:
Nowadays, due to the rising population and a limited number of educational institutions high numbers of students are being admitted to a single institution. Classrooms are accommodating a considerable number of students which is quite problematic for faculty members to reserve time for each and every student considering the difficulty level of educational studies and quantity of time required if they try to allocate it for each individual. These problems can be resolved substantially if educational management distributes all students into groups and allocate separate days for students who are weak or the ones who cannot understand easily. Further, the state should be responsible in the long term to establish and develop more and more educational institutions to cater and serve rising educational needs.
Firstly, the school/college authorities should divide all the pupils into groups by keeping in view the previous examination results so that in each group there could be a blend of high IQ and average IQ students. For instance, the high achievers can help and teach the weak students in their group to keep up with the studies. The authorities can announce some sought of incentives for all these top scorers in the form of scholarships. This example illustrates that forming groups of different mental capabilities will help the weak and relieve the heavy workload for teachers. The suggestion of segregating pupils into small factions will serve quite a bit in good grades of weaker students whom the teachers are unable to pay attention.
Secondly,  the authority of educational institutions should allocate a separate day apart from working days to pay dedicated attention to poor grade achievers. For instance, on weekends schedule should be announced in which every interested student can come and discuss the problems at ease with the subject teacher. This idea will result in improvement of students with poor results and make them more motivated about the subject they were initially afraid off. Thirdly, the state authorities should plan a long-term strategy for building a large number of school, colleges and university by considering the growth in population and budgetary constraints. This will support in reducing the pressure on existing institutions as well as create a more competitive environment.
To conclude, all the existing and already established educational institution are trying their level best to provide education but keeping in mind huge quantity of students it is quite unrealistic to expect from these to pay all the students dedicated time. The solutions suggested earlier, splitting students into different groups, allocating one day in weekends and developing new institutions are both short term and long term. These problems can also be arrested easily if students can be encouraged to do more self-study.
Essay 598:
Many people believe that tobacco use has deleterious effects on their health and passive smoking is also very dangerous and that is why smoking must be banned in the public places. Although there are strong arguments that support this perspective, I strongly believe that it is not reasonable to restrict tobacco smoking in the society.
Primarily, it is evident that restraining those cigarette consumers from smoking can cause withdrawal symptoms. This cigarette has an addictive substance called nicotine that leads to the feeling of euphoria for the users. For instance, a chain smoker will become uncomfortable if they cannot smoke at least one stick of cigarette. Thereby, they become depressed and lethargic as their bodies are highly dependent on a substance which alters the mood. This often seems to affect their well-being such concentration and decision making since smoking exalts their body to become more active.
Furthermore, there are reasons to suggest that tobacco products will relocate to the black market as they are made illegitimate in the society. If the consumers purchase this product in illegal merchandise, they might be tempted to patronise other dangerous substance such as Cocaine and Marijuana. Black market offers nefarious goods available for those people who are unsatisfied with the products sold in the public market. As a result, the incidence of crimes may escalate due to the fact that substance can create inhibitions, which make the intoxicated people irrational about their actions. To illustrate, they could do heinous things as they might see as they are not aware of their morality.
Lastly, it can never be denied that it is the right of every individual to smoke. It would be a breach of their personal decision to smoke cigarettes if the government banned these products. It is possible that these people might resent the higher authority because they are the one who spends their salary on cigarettes, not the government officials. Hence, they will retaliate such as building a riot or promoting a democratic amendment to the government.
To conclude, I am convinced that cigarette should not be eradicated in public merchandises as there are people who are dependent on these products. There is a very likelihood that crimes would surge if these products were eliminated in the society. 
Essay 600:
There are arguments to suggest that a rising number of commercial establishments such as malls and supermarket have resulted in a decrease in the number of small-scale business stores. There are several positive outcomes behind this trend and a considerable number of potential drawbacks.
Primarily, it could be argued that in some large scale commercial establishments, there are a variety of selections about personal commodities such as clothing, shoes, and bags. There is a view that well-developed shops have to increase the supply of their products because some small commercial establishment cannot provide the entire goods to the public. Taking into consideration the local store which has a limited supply of personal goods in a remote area, it seems apparent that some store owners have paucity in the investment of commercial goods, thus they cannot maximise the supply and demand of their business. Furthermore, it is often claimed that there is an amenable price in some more affluent shopping centres that some developing merchandises. Many people consider that there is an additional cost for some products available in the local store due to some owners who procure the supply of their shop to other large distributors of goods. For instance, the store keeper will gain a higher profitable income if they obtain some products to some higher commercial distributors, which sell cheap consumer goods. As a result, there will be an advantage for local store keepers.
In contrast, it can never be denied that there are negative effects of opting to large shops. Firstly, there is a strong argument that the location of these establishments is often located at the city centre thereby it would be a burden for those people who live in a rural place to purchase their personal goods. Secondly, it is often claimed that in some local stores, there are reasons to suggest that there are residents who have developed relationship with some store keeper, therefore it might be the case that the customer could ask a favorable grant to some small stores such as lending a market good and paying it at a definite time.
In my opinion, a variety of selection in large shops could make the customers confused on which items will be the best. Moreover, it is debatable that those products with low price are the ones which are outdated and leftover of the previous peak sale.
Essay 601:
Since the beginning of the recorded time, aboriginals have always been interested in learning by the mean of travelling around the globe. Has it be explorers such as Columbus, Darwin or other prominent wanderers, this world was explored and discovered by sightseeing. In the wake of education with travelling, the majority of institutions have included sight visiting as a predominant determinant while designing a course. Some people believe learning by seeing is propitious for scholars; however, other claims the opposite. I will discuss both the sides in the viability of the argument and state an opinion.
On the one hand, opponents of adding travelling in education claim that it will hinder students to excel academically. Firstly, subjects like Mathematics, Physics and Information Technology do not require a pupil to see a sight or travel to learn them. For an example, if someone wants to be a mathematician, he must be excellent in mathematical skills and travelling to places will not add value for such students in learning and assimilating scientific concepts. Therefore, travelling has no importance in learning these subjects. Secondly, the exchange program to learn can act as a hinder in learning, as every country will have its own set of educational standards, which may not be suitable for every student. Thus, many contend that adding travelling in the curriculum is not viable and beneficial for scholars.
On the other hand, proponents of assimilating travelling as a determinant in learning claim various rationales in support of the opinion. One the most profuse reason is on account of learning associated with practical knowledge. These advocates also assert that practical learning by sightseeing inculcates a permanent learning among the scholars, which is mandatory for the overall development of students. It can be confirmed by the latest report of education society of India, which has published the statistics of experiments on students. As per experiment, pupils were divided into two groups and taught a lesson in two different ways, the first group was taught theoretically and another group was taught practically by showing the actual sight. As per results, children taught using sightseeing were able to retain the information for 20 days extra than the students educated theoretically. Likewise, students can learn more if they will travel to other countries. It will not only impart an impetus to their academic learning, but also it will infuse cross-cultural understanding. Consequently, it will enhance the overall growth of students.
To sum up, after discussing both sides of the argument, I am convinced that advantages of adding travelling in education overweigh the disadvantages and it must be encouraged for the overall academic and social development of the scholars.
Essay 602:
High School is the high time when teenagers put their first step towards independence. If they can be educated with practical skills, it will help them enormously in facing real world challenges. Practical skills like money management can assist them in better management of their life. Some people may argue that practical skills are best learnt in real life rather than the classroom.
Teenagers get fixed allowance from their parents and some do part-time jobs to fund their expenditures. Although they do not possess large sums of money, any thug can cheat them easily. For instance, many teenagers take loans to fulfil their illegal activities like drinking, drugs and smoking. They end up owing huge sums to loan sharks, without sensing the troubles ahead. If they learn practical skills like money management, they can wisely take control of their life and stay out of troubles.
Some people believe practical skills cannot be taught in classrooms. As the name suggests, it can be best learnt by dealing with life. For example, if money management and risk management are taught in class, there is no guarantee that pupil can get success in life. He can be too risk averse and avoid excellent tools of money making like Share trading, betting and even government bonds. If we look at successful people like Ambanis, they did not learn practical skills in the classroom, but in real life. Highly educated Charted Accounts, engineers and clerks work under their leadership.
In conclusion, teaching practical skills can alert and educate teenagers to combat the real life nuisances. However, a few things can be best learnt by experience and most successful people gained expertise by experimenting.
Essay 604:
Organic fruits and vegetables cost more than conventional fruits and vegetables but many people are willing to pay the higher price to get the organic ones. In my opinion, it is worth paying more for these organic products because it is natural and safe. Genetically modified fruits and vegetables have more pesticides and chemicals added that could be harmful to our health. The two key reasons why organic products are the best are they have fewer pesticides and more nutrients.
The conventional fruits and vegetables look more convincing in the stores. It is usually cheaper and good looking that catches buyers. While organic fruits are sad looking which have holes and spots or rotten part, they offer better food value. Sometimes they look wrinkled and shrivelled. However, organic fruits and vegetables produce higher levels of nutrients than conventional counterparts. Furthermore, it produces more antioxidant compound linked to better health. Eating fresh organic fruits and vegetables are more nutritious and tasty. No need to settle for less if it is better than commercially grown fruits and vegetables.
Moreover, exposure to pesticides from conventional products has some health effect such as risks of cancer, nervous system diseases and reproductive problems. Pesticides can be absorbed into fruits and vegetables and leave trace residues that could have toxic effects on humans. Another thing aside from harmful effects, it has also environmental effects. Chemical pesticides are known to pollute the environment. With several potentially harmful effects on health and environment, the cost will be more likely to double for hospitalisation.
Therefore, organic fruits and vegetables are much better than conventional fruits and vegetables. They are worth an extra cost for the health benefits we could get in fewer pesticides fruits and vegetables.
Essay 605:
There are arguments to suggest that people have become a great consumer of products without the initiative to recycle the old items, which are not functioning anymore. There are reasons behind this trend and a considerable number of repercussions in the society.
Primarily, it could be argued that the advent of technology has an enormous contribution to the attitude of some individuals about personal equipment. It is often claimed that some factories have adopted the use of machines in manufacturing products such as appliances and cell phones, therefore they can hasten the reproduction but with low quality. Some businessmen have gathered the raw materials to other countries, which may provide frugal spare parts. Because of the cheap materials, these shop owners can decrease the price of their products that could be amenable to the public. Furthermore, there is a strong argument that asserts that the behaviour of the mankind has changed in this contemporary period due to advancement in technology. For instance, some people might not be so eager to bring their defected instruments to the repair centre because of the new model that may arise in the market.
On the other hand, it is widely believed that there are negative effects of being nonchalant about the possibilities that a non-functional product could be use again. Firstly, it would contribute to the pollution because those products are certainly made from plastic and hazardous chemicals. To illustrate, a stock of cell phones cannot be disposed of easily through incineration. It would be a difficult problem if there was a surplus of those personal goods. These cell phones contain batteries which are deleterious to human’s health. Secondly, there is a view that this trend might be adopted by the next generation since the progress of technology is inevitable. For example, some youngsters might acclimatise to the view and habit of the seniority, thus this trend will be handed to their next offspring.
To conclude, the advent of technology and the cheap products have piqued some people to be dissuaded from reusing superannuated items. It is the environment and the virtue of the next generation that will be affected by this trend.
Essay 607:
Ever since the genesis of industrialisation, the world has gone through many paradigm shifts.  This is also evident in the fact that average family size is getting smaller. It is argued that rising costs of living and career-oriented thinking are the primary reasons for this trend. These causes and their effects will be analysed in this essay
To begin, ever since the industrial revolution, rising cost of living in cities has compelled people to shrink the size of their families due to economic reasons. This has resulted in families spending more time with their offspring, since the number of children, among which parents have to divide their time, has reduced dramatically. For example, a recent study conducted by Save the Children, a not for profit organisation, found that children of the modern era do much better than their earlier counterparts in schools and colleges. This would perhaps not be possible if parents had to spend a large amount of their time nurturing the needs of a higher number of children. Hence, the impact a small family size has on child’s academics is clear.
In addition, the advent of technology has removed the need for human intervention in many jobs, as a consequence, now more people have to compete for fewer jobs. Such circumstances have made people more career oriented than they used to be, therefore, starting and expansion of families has moved to the bottom of the pecking order of many people’s priorities. The most evident effect of this on society is an ageing population in many of the western countries in the world. For instance, in Germany, the population growth rate is in negative, which could perhaps mean that the current generation of Germany will not be able to replace their dying forefathers in numbers. Therefore the devastating impact of small families is also evident.
As is clear, improved academic performances of children on the one hand and the probable extinction of genes of some, on the other hand, are the two of most prominent impacts of decreasing family sizes. It is thus hoped that people will muse upon greatly before choosing their career paths and starting families.
Essay 608:
This contemporary milieu has been influenced by new innovation in technology, which has affected the natural environment. There are arguments to suggest that people should live in a traditional form of lifestyle to rectify ecological problems. However, it can be argued that the technology can offer solutions to tackle the environmental destruction.
Primarily, it is indubitable that the natural habitat could be preserved if most people adapted to manual labour rather than machines. It might be the case that some farmers use mechanical ploughs, which emits a considerable amount of fumes, to weed their farm. There is a view that these machines, which hasten the productivity, have helped people from their daily routine task. As a result, the demand of machines will also lead to the production of carbon dioxide, which will contribute to global warming.  Furthermore, there are reasons to suggest that some of the machines have been used to exploit environmental resources. Taking into consideration the use of the chain saw that accelerates the logging of live trees. It is also possible that some businessmen have established factories, and most of the equipment is reliant on fossil fuel. In the previous era, majority of primitive people have survived even without the use of technology, thus in this modern world, some would consider that people can still thrive by reducing the usage of machines.
In contrast, it can never be denied that the advent of technology has contributed to the development of a country and even the preservation of mother earth can be granted by modern studies. To illustrate, there is a feasible study6 that asserts that the ultraviolet rays coming from the sun can be prevented through the use of mirrors which will b flown in the space. As a result, the sun rays will be deflected by the million of mirrors in the space, and that will be viable because of the continuous development in technology. In addition, the possibility to recycle the old goods and rubbish has become realistic because of the application of technology. For instance, the disintegration of matter and moulding to a new form can be ascribed to advances in machinery and computers.
In my opinion, time is inevitably progressing, and people need to adapt to the modern culture. Moreover, there has been as strict legislation that precludes people from abusing the environmental resource, thus they might seldom use technology to harm the forest.
To conclude, some people believe that they should not become more reliant on machines in order to maintain the wealth of the environment, yet it is compelling that technology has been proven to produce amenable aid to resolve the environmental hazards and pollution.
Essay 610:
Ever since the genesis of industrialisation, human beings have gone through many different changes. This is evident from the fact that people are no longer as physically fit and active as they used to be.  It is argued that increasing use of technology and removal of many physically demanding jobs are the two cardinal reasons for this. To tackle these problems, educational programs and establishment of health facilities will be analysed for viability.
To begin, many individuals have adopted television and internet browsing as their hobbies, which has led to them adopting sedentary lifestyles. To counter this, educational programs aimed at these people can educate them about the hazards such a lifestyle poses to the health of an individual. For instance, the government of Pakistan has run many infomercials in the past few year to increase the awareness about the importance of exercising among the geriatric population. Which in turn, resulted in lower number of elderly people reporting joint related problems in the coming years. Therefore, the effectiveness of such targeted campaigns can be clearly seen.
In addition, due to industrialisation, the nature of jobs around the world has moved from being physically demanding to service oriented. Consequently, a large chunk of people does not get the necessary physical activity required to have a sound body. For this, establishment of more health facilities around the residential areas is a plausible solution. For example, a psychological study, recently conducted, found that people are generally less likely to exercise if they have to travel a long distance to get to the exercise location. As this shows, the establishment of such facilities near people’s residences is an effective method to address lifestyle-related problems.
As is clear, targeted educational campaigns and setting up more health clubs are two effectual ways to make people form healthy habits and become healthy individuals. It is thus hoped that these strategies are put into practice by the masses the world over.
Essay 611:
The 20th century has been the century of inventions and innovations. Fields like transport, telecom, medical, education etc. all have seen the phenomenal developments but one of the significant revolutions in the technology is the internet. The internet has changed the landscape of human life to an unimaginable level. The computer has made this planet just like a global village and created millions of employment opportunities.
Firstly, the computer has transformed this planet into one family. Everyone who wants information regarding anything can access through the internet in just a matter of seconds regardless of his place and location. You can view of information, lifestyle, population and other geographical information of any country in the world. For instance, if I want to compare the top universities of the world it would hardly take a minute which would otherwise be not possible without this blessing. It is evident that the internet has shrunken this world like one home in which everyone is a family member.
Secondly, the internet has created job opportunities for millions of people. Work options have been created in the form of web designing, web hosting, online product sales, software development and hundreds more which cannot be listed here. For example, the biggest company in the world which has the most expensive share in New York Stock exchange is none other than Google. This supports the logic that the internet has been one of the significant causes of job creation.
However, there are some drawbacks also of this technology. Cyber crimes and fake business have entered in this world of internet. To illustrate that, many hackers have hacked the important and national security websites of not only third world countries but also leading nations like the United States. These cyber crimes are playing the havoc with the intelligence agencies of the world. Thus, it can be seen that these crimes are depicting the negative pictures of this technology.
To summarise, the internet has truly changed the face of the world making it a very small one and giving the opportunities of millions of people to earn their livelihood. The internet has truly been the greatest development of 20th century. It is recommended that states should make tight laws to curb the illegal activity going on the internet.
Essay 612:
As millions of people and organisations of all stripes can post information on the Internet, more people don’t deem the content they see online accurate. However, there is still credible information on the Internet, which is harder to be ferreted out.
It is understandable that people desire to be focused on, especially those who want to become stars, the Internet is the most effective way to make this happen. Thus this drives many of them to spread their personal information to attract more viewers so that one day their gifts may be paid attention to. Also, for some business organisations, they usually create exaggerated advertisements to propagate their products, while actually, their products are not as perfect as the advertisements described.
On the other hand, in some repressive regimes, media is closely tied to the government. Media outlets provide information not for the well-being of civilians but for the propaganda of the regime so that they can control the regime for their own interests.
However, all those critics of Internet information do not mean that there is little reliable information. After all, there are people telling lies out of their personal interests, there are definitely a large group of people being against lies and keeping digging the truth, though. Therefore, the target that those authoritative organisations and individuals posting their information is, to tell the truth, and clear the clouds, which makes their information accurate and reliable.
After all, in the world with diverse cultures and races, it is impossible to guarantee all information being objectively accurate. All we should do is to keep a clear head and become more efficient to sort out the accurate information from those detrimentally false so that we can stand on the impartial side.
Essay 613:
In most countries around the world, while paying taxes is required by the law and considered a civic duty, it also brings about downsides that lead to certain individuals or corporations trying to evade or deduct the tax they need to pay.
Some people claim that levying taxes is unfair and they deserve to keep all their legitimate income to themselves because they fight every single minute for it. High taxes can not only stifle the motivation of individual workers but also exert a negative effect of penalising hard work. The more concerning situation, however, is that with all taxpayers’ money accumulated, the government, albeit even an elected one, could misuse or even become corrupted, not to mention those authoritarian ones. In this case, it is better to keep the money to their own instead of anyone else.
However, other people argue that taxes revenue provides a vital source for the government who shoulder the responsibility to build a strong country and provide important public services such as police, healthcare, education and many other vital ones which are closely tied to every single citizen’s well-being. Without this revenue, there would be no money to pay for government workers, resulting in no organisation to run the country and probably jeopardising national security. Therefore, paying taxes should be every single taxpayer’s responsibility.
My view is that it is every capable citizen’s duty to pay taxes to support and provide our government necessary sources to protect our entire country as well as improve our personal life quality, only in the condition that they must be well used and absolutely cannot be abused by incompetent officials.
Essay 614:
People have different views about the effect of the international tourism. While I accept that international tourism has some positive impacts on our lives, I believe that it has more negative impacts compared to positive ones.
On the one hand, International tourism has many advantages. Firstly from the personal perspective, tourism is a most popular leisure activity. Tourists can relax and have fun by sightseeing a new place. Also, tourism broadens their horizons and opened minds by exposing them to different cultures and customs. Secondly, from an economic perspective, tourism industry plays a vital role in many countries. People may rely on tourism for their income. Also, tourism industry creates many jobs opportunities in services like hotels and restaurants. As a result, international tourism improves the standard of living in some local areas.
On the other hand, I believe that International tourism has more negative impacts on the environment and local cultures. From an environmental perspective, tourism may affect the environment negatively in three ways. Firstly, the excessive building needed by tourism industry could destroy natural habitats and even may result in the extinction of many animals and plants. Also, international tourism causes more pollution and wastage. Finally, Tourism industry puts more pressure on natural resources like oil and water and this may lead to the shortage of some basic human needs. From a cultural perspective, tourism may affect local cultures negatively. Traditional jobs and skills like farming and fishing may die out because tourism forces people to work in their services. So, this may lead to loss of many cultural features and values.
In conclusion, it seems to me that the potential dangers of international tourism on the environment and culture are more significant than the possible benefits on personal and economical sectors. Governments should impose laws to protect the environment and local cultures.
Essay 616:
Ever since the genesis of industrialisation, people’s lifestyles have gone through a paradigm shift. This is evident from the fact that people today often buy new things instead of getting the old ones fixed. It is argued that rising standards of living and hectic lifestyles are the two cardinal causes for this trend. These causes along with their effects will be analysed in this essay.
To begin, industrialisation has brought with it the rise in standards of living for most of the world and people can afford to buy new things instead of getting the old things repaired. This is ensured by the development of the habit of spending money on things that people don’t need in the first place. Take the USA, for example, where many individuals excessively squander money from their credit cards on things that although cost a lot but have a very short lifespan such as smartphones. This phenomenon has led to an inordinate amount of cases of personal bankruptcy in the US. Hence, the devastating effects of buying new things instead of fixing the old ones are obvious.
In addition, the modern era puts a lot of stress on the individuals, which means most of them don’t have the necessary spare time left to repair the old things. This has indirectly resulted in the increase in the amount of waste that is produced each year via the disposal of old things. For instance, a recent study conducted by the University of Balochistan, Pakistan, found that the amount of waste that an average household in Pakistan produces has quadrupled in the past few decades. Consequently, much of this waste is dumped into the rivers and seas, which has raised the pollution to exorbitant levels. Therefore, the effect on the environment that buying new things instead of getting the old ones fixed is manifested through this alarming finding.
As is clear from the above analysis, the rise in the living standards of individuals and time constraints brought about by modernization are the primary reasons that people these days, buy new things instead of getting the old ones repaired. It is hoped that individuals will exert themselves to counter the negative ramifications brought about by this trend.
Essay 617:
In the past few decades, mankind has made tremendous technological advances and world has truly become a small village because of globalisation. Now, more and more people are able to afford cars. This has caused an increase in the level of noise and air pollution in large cities.
One solution would be to impose a large amount of tax on privately owned cards. This would discourage people to use their own vehicle to commute to work and utilise other means of public transport. This can definitely reduce the traffic in urban city areas. However, this only deals with a part of the population.  Rich could easily afford to pay the higher tax; while, on the other hand, only poor would be affected by this law.
Another way government could tackle this problem is to encourage people to use public transportation. The legal authorities could introduce more comfortable and convenient trains, buses and metros to attract more people.  As a result, more and more citizens would use public transport services and thus the level of traffic and pollution would definitely reduce.
Lastly, the government should put more money into researches to find more renewable resources such as solar power and wind instead of using coal and petrol.  In addition, there could be seminars or lectures to educate people about how our ways of living are affecting the environment. This may not be a quick solution but it does help to tackle the issues at hand in a long run.
Essay 618:
In our life choosing a career is an important factor to consider. If I had to choose between high salary and high level of enjoyment, I think I would choose the high salary. If I will choose a career for enjoyment basis only, I might not earn enough money. High paid jobs are beneficial socially and economically, as now will be discussed.
Essay 619:
It is undeniable that water scarcity is becoming a worldwide problem. The growth of population is the main reason for this alarming trend, but some measures could be taken to tackle this predicament.
One the one hand, the pressure of the growing population on water resources could lead to the shortage of it. Increase number of population lead to an increased water demand in three sectors namely Agriculture, Industry and households. Firstly, from an agricultural perspective, irrigation consumes a large amount of water. Also, Agricultural industry could pollute the rest of the water by chemical compounds that used in farming like pesticides. Secondly, the industries and factories use a huge amount of water in their process. For instance, some research revealed that meat processing industry could be the main cause of water shortage in some regions of the UK. Finally, water used for household purposes could be another consequence of growth number of population and ultimately could lead to water demand.
On the other hand, there are two main solutions to solve the problems described above. One solution is that water recycling could play an important role in water conservation. Governments should build new water pipes system for recycling and should encourage people to use recycled water. Another solution is to remove salts from sea water to enable people to use it. This process called desalination. It is now used in many countries like the USA and achieved their goal.
Essay 620:
Throughout the 21st century, a lot of significant global events have happened at different locations. Sports, which is played among nations, is one such event which is becoming extremely popular, especially among the youngsters of the developed nations. The discussion that whether or not to host an international sporting program by a nation is advantageous is a debatable one, with strong logics provided by the supporters of both the views.
On the one hand, a sense of patriotism will be increased among the citizens of the hosting country due to the fact that they will be proud to see their country in the international headlines, during the entire event. In addition to that, the nation's top leaders have an opportunity to hand over the price to the winners. For example, in 2005 when Brazil hosted the soccer world cup, every day the name 'Brazil' was seen in almost all media like newspapers, televisions and the internet. Secondly, motivation will be cultivated among the youths of the host country, and will actively try to play the game locally. This can bring up the sporting potential of the citizens and later help to play for the nation. For instance, the proportion of citizens playing cricket increased by 10 percent after India hosted cricket world cup in 2000. Thus, a country can have many sportsmen in the pool and pick the best ones.
On the other hand, there are security threats especially from the terrorists or by opponents from the start to the end of the program. A lot of money needs to be spent to deploy the military forces, round the clock, to ensure that the nation is completely under control. In 2005, Brazil spent 25 million dollars to ensure that the country is secure in all aspects. Moreover, this money could be used for the starving people, especially in Africa. Thus, some people gravitate towards this point of view.
In conclusion, although I understand that huge money needs to be spent for safety purposes, I totally agree that hosting international sporting events are advantageous for both - the hosting country and the attending countries. There should be regular sporting events held internationally every year, to promote peace and love.
Essay 621:
International sporting events held after every three to four year all over the world. A large number of people travel across the world to support their team during the event. Some people argue that these events bring prosperity, enthusiasm, entertainment and business for the hosting nation. Others claim that it could have dire consequences and severe negative effect on the lives of local people.
Firstly, sporting tournaments play a pivotal role in strengthening the economy of the organising country. Numerous tourists and visitors attend these events to support and lift up the morale of their teams. Local people observe a dramatic rise in the sales of their goods and services.
Secondly, sport is a source of entertainment and fun for its followers. People get the chance to meet and enjoy the performance of their favourite sports star. Thirdly, it provides an opportunity to meet new people and understand their culture and traditions that could substantially decrease the tension between the people of rival countries. International sporting events also popularise a country to the world and thus the potential tourism industry of this country gets benefits from that.
However, it is often seen that people burst out as their team lose the match that could exacerbate the situation in the ground and make it a battlefield. Additionally, congestion, adequate accommodation and visitor’s safety are the few issues that are caused by these events. During 2010 football world cup in Brazil, a record number of thefts and stolen cases were reported. To tackle such problems required enormous funds and detailed planning. Not all sports can attract international visitors and fans and thus many of these sporting events cost a lot while earning a little.  
To sum up, I would like to say that international events help in minimising tensions and create stronger bonding among many nations. Successful occurring of event really helps in thriving the country’s economy and provides adverse advantages to its citizen. However, it also has some problems but that can be handled by imposing strict rules of laws and educating people.
A group of people think that hosting international sporting tournaments would bring a lot of benefits for their country, while others believe that it would cause some issues. The following essay will discuss both of these views but I personally believe that such an event has more positive things than its negatives.
On the one hand, it is believed that international sporting events would bring some serious problems for the host country. One of the problems is that the government needs to build new or renovate existing sports facilities, which means that they have to have a large budget for that. Many people believe that the budget could be spent on other important things such as improving public health facilities or developing a better education system. Another issue is that when the tournament is being held, tourists from all over the world would come to the country. Some people are afraid that it might threat the national security, as some terrorists might come to the country. Besides some others point that as a threat to the local way of life and traditions a country has.
On the other hand, another group of people believe that hosting a world class sports tournament such as Olympics or Asian Games would bring so many benefits and potentials to the hosting country. Firstly, as the country needs to renovate or build new sports facilities, it means that it will create new job opportunities for the local people. Secondly, as tourist and supporters from all over the world would come to the country, it will also boost the local tourism industry. Third, tourists who come to the country will spend their money on accommodation, travel, entertainment and foods, which means that it would generate more revenue for the local businesses and for the government through taxes. Again, the sporting event would inspire local people to participate this type of sporting event and thus the country will ultimately have a generation who are good at sports. Furthermore, the country would get international exposure as a lot of people around the world would watch the sporting event and would learn about this country. This has a great benefit in terms of tourism and international trade for this country. Finally, hosting this type of sporting events often enhances the diplomatic relationship among nations and that is a great way of maintaining world peace.   
In conclusion, it is a fact that holding an international sporting event would have its own positive and negative sides. In my personal opinion, I believe that the benefits of hosting the event are greater than the drawbacks.
Essay 623:
Activities, as it is said, keep a person young and energetic. It is in tune with it that a person must always keep oneself occupied with an activity of any sort. Sporting activity is one of many activities which pay no heed to the age barrier.
As a matter of fact, sporting activities contribute a lot towards the physical fitness, mental ability / balance and overall characteristic of an individual. However, a ‘dangerous’ sporting activity must be undertaken by an individual with an extra caution. Though a dangerous sporting activity is generally performed due to a sudden rush of adrenalin but the consequences of such an activity are not reasonably positively skewed. The probability of an untoward incident, while performing a dangerous sporting activity, is always high.
It is due to this reason that State interference, to a reasonable extent, is welcome. The activities which are more skewed towards the possibility of a fatal accident must be regulated and consequently banned by the government.
However, there is another school of thought which is on the view that individuals must be accorded the freedom to choose the sport according to their wishes. The ideology of the followers of this school of thought is that the individual is matured enough to understand what is more beneficial to him. However, they fail to look beyond the veil, probably reason due to which an individual undertakes the performance of such dangerous acts. The reasons may vary from peer pressure, family circumstances, financial needs or just momentary pleasure. Whatever may be the reason, an individual must not be given the liberty to put his life, and consequently the life of his dependents, at risk. The fortnightly sports magazine, The Risktakers, did share the views of the son of the famous skydiver, Peterson, who met with an accident while trying to attempt skiing after getting himself released from the parachute at a height of only 15 feet above the ground level.
Yet another interview with the daughter of another renowned sports person, Robinson, revealed the sad story wherein after the death of his paratrooper father, it became difficult for her to make her both ends meet during her teenage. The only reason for the death of her father was that he wanted to set a record of jumping from an unbelievable height.
In the end, I am of the opinion that there should be the complete ban on the dangerous sporting activities as it is the survivors of the deceased who has to pay a heavy price for the acts of their mentors.
Essay 624:
With the passage of time, there have been tremendous changes in the behaviour and consequently the lifestyles of people, especially the young and working couples. Yet another factor which has played the role of a catalyst is the ‘materialistic need’ of the human in the ever-changing pattern of living in the modern times. Due to such unrealistic expectations from the life, the parents have started devoting much of their time towards satisfying their materialistic needs at the cost of the ‘precious gift’ that they have been blessed with, by the Almighty, their children.
Children, for their parents, are dearer than fine opals, more precious than Emeralds! However, due to the discontentment in the life of parents, it is the innocent childhood which has to pay a heavy price.
In the yesteryears, even though the means of livelihood were limited but the quality time spent with children was enough to boost confidence amongst them and make the children a successful and a matured individual.  However, in the modern times, though there has been a manifold increase in the means of livelihood, but the price at which such an increase is achieved is negatively skewed. It is the children who are devoid of the, much needed, attention which they truly and rightly deserve.
In a recent interview published in the local tabloid, the renowned choreographers of the famous band, OPEXA, did share their own experience wherein they blamed themselves (husband and wife) for the unhealthy upbringing of their children which ultimately led to their children becoming victims of drug abuse. In the end, I agree that though there is the need to adapt according to the modern lifestyles and requirements but the same must not be achieved at the cost of innocence, love, warmth and tenderness of one’s children.
Essay 625:
Crime is an act which is said to be done when an action, either done or not done, is performed as against the conduct prescribed by the law. The crimes committed within the territory of a country are dealt by the courts constituted to take note of such crimes within the country. Whereas, on the other hand, crimes that are committed outside the territory of a country are taken care of by the international law courts, which are constituted by deliberate efforts of several countries. Hence, the crimes committed outside the territorial jurisdiction of a country are termed as International crimes and are dealt in accordance with the International laws in the International Law Courts.
The environment of a country does make a great impact on the commission of a crime. In case, there is rampant unemployment or irregular distribution of income amongst the habitats of a country, the environment is congenial for the growth of crimes. On the other hand, if the population of a country is in consensus with the employment opportunities available, the environment is congenial for a healthy and secure life.
One of the glaring examples of the effect of environment on the commission of a crime can be seen from the crime graph of European countries and their counterparts in the continent of Asia. The data, as provided in the latest edition of the crime magazine, the Outlaws, clearly depicts the crime graph negatively skewed against the Asian countries. Apart from this, the horror stories of terrorism in the current scenario also support that the environment of a country does have an impact on crime.
The role of International Laws and International Law Courts is totally absent in reducing the crime levels within the territory of a country.  However, their role is very important in the case of crimes committed by a country outside its territory. Again, as already said, the crime is committed due to the environment in which a country is. Hence, a country which is internally in turmoil will, most probably, resort to crimes even on the international soil where the International Laws are adhered to.
In the end, I do agree that the environment, both within and outside, a country has a negative impact on its habitat who resort to crime. However, the presence of international laws and international law courts is unrealistic to reduce crime levels within different countries but does play a positive role to solve and reduce crime levels, when committed outside the country.
Essay 626:
Cigarettes and alcohol negatively influence human health and lead to very bad addiction. While some people believe that smoking and drinking alcohol do not have that much detriment effect on health and should be sold freely, I firmly believe that smoking and alcohol are drugs that lead to health problems and addiction and, as a result, they should be prohibited.
First of all, tobacco is a silent killer not only for smokers but also for people around. Smoking is known as a cause of more than 25 different deadly diseases including lung cancer, bronchitis and emphysema. According to the recent statistics, four million people around the world die yearly from tobacco-related diseases - one death every eight seconds. Tobacco is significantly becoming a greater cause of death and disability than any other single cause. Therefore, smoking cigarettes is a huge global threat and should be illegal. The number of female and young smokers is increasing globally and completely banning cigarettes could be an effective measure to enhance public health. The amount of money a country spend each year to treat people who suffer from tobacco-related diseases could be better utilised to treat other patients.   
The next point that needs to be taken into consideration is alcohol that has already become a serious problem during the last centuries. More and more people use alcohol every day and sometimes not only a glass of wine during the evening but also far more than usual. As a result, this group of people becomes unhealthy. Moreover, drinking too much alcohol can lead to more serious problems such as brain damage and even can cause a separation with the partner and break a family. Moreover, children struggle a lot from drunkard parents. Therefore, alcohol should be banned globally. The negative health and social problems the alcohol creates are enormous and the banning it will bring more social stability, morality and better life expectancy.  
To sum up, from my point of view, cigarettes and alcohol are two greatest threats to the society and our health. They lead to various problems and harm not only individuals who use it but also others, surrounding them. I believe that people can live their lives more happily without those heinous drugs and substance.
Essay 627:
Whether taking care of elder citizens is the sole responsibility of family members or that should be supported by the government is a very controversial issue. With the increasing life expectancy and modern healthcare system the number of senior citizens is increasing in most of the countries and how those old people should be supported is an issue that indeed requires a comprehensive discussion.
First of all, the people should themselves prepare for their old ages and save money so that they do not have to rely solely on others for their maintenance. It is quite a hard reality that if an old person has a good amount of money and properties the number of people to look after him would be plenty. The reverse is also true and that’s why the people should always have plans for savings for their rainy days.
However, old people not only needs medical support, a place to live and nurses to look after them, they also need people to talk to them, care them and spend time with them which money cannot buy. The family members must take care of their elder parents or grandparents and spend time with them rather than sending them to a retirement home. It is quite inhuman to send an old family member to an old home while s/he has cared for the family members for the whole life. The debt we have to our grandparents and parents could never be repaid, however, we should try to at least repay them some by caring them in a way they did when we were children.  
Finally, not all old people will have close relatives and family members to look after them. The government would have to support the older generation who have served the country and society with their every effort. The old people have all paid tax when they were employed and thus the government has a natural obligation to support the old people by providing improved medical support, retirement homes with all necessary facilities. The government does not have control whether a family decides to take care of an old member or send them in a retirement home. But proper arrangement and facilities for those elderly should be supported by the government.
In conclusion, I believe that supporting older people is an issue that should be backed up in every way possible.  A young person should take preparation for his old age while the family members and governments should play their role so that those fragile and helpless old people do not suffer at all.

Nowadays people are living more than 80 or even 100 years and most of them are unable to look after themselves. The controversy over who is responsible for providing service for elderly people is hot debated. Some individuals suggest that families are required to care the old people, others argue that the government should organise retirement homes for older people.
In many countries, people firmly believe that families should take care the old ones who are unable to do it themselves. For example, in Russia and China, it is common believe that it is a responsibility of families and if a family decide to send their parents to the retirement home it is considered disrespectful. Therefore, most of the families do it themselves. There is a general believe that families can care better and provide reasonable services to their old generation rather than it could be done in the retirement homes where the service is poor and not sufficient enough. Not only this, it is considered that the most significant source of happiness can give grandchildren and children to the elderly whereas it cannot be provided by any of the retirement places.
On the other hand, the different opinion exists that the government should ensure a place in the retirement homes for elderly. For example, in Australia and Canada people argue that the government should give a place to the eldest when they are unable to provide care for themselves because the families should work, raise their children and live their lives most of all looking after themselves and the next generation. In those countries, the way of thinking and believes vary to Russia and China and people can rely on such institutions like retirement homes to look after their parents where the service is good and pleasant.
To sum up, there are two opinions about who should look after the old individuals and for different countries, there is a different way to go. In my opinion, no matter who takes care the old parents, it should be done properly and from the bottom of the hard. In the perfect situation, a balance is required between families and the retirement homes to look after the eldest.
Essay 629:
Many people think that printed newspapers and books are outdated these days, as they believe that online news and electronic books are more relevant and updated to the current condition. The two types have their own benefits and it will depend on the preference of each individual, and the following essay will discuss them in details.
On the one hand, it is true that hardcopy versions of newspapers and books are outdated compared to online versions. The online newspaper or book can be immediately updated or revised by their editors from their servers, therefore readers will always get the latest news. And then, it is easier to purchase online literature as people would just open their gadgets, log in and insert their credit card numbers, and they could get new articles.
On the other hand, although several people think that printed media are old fashioned, but certain people prefer to buy these outdated versions. Firstly, they believe that reading print out versions is better that online ones because they have fewer side effects to the eyes. They think that reading books using gadgets will have negative effects on their visual, as these devices are producing some radiations which could irritate the eyesight. Secondly, a lot of people prefer to buy the hardcopy version, because they like to collect them. Many people are collecting print out versions of comics because it is their hobby and they have certain kind of satisfactions when they could keep them for collections.
In conclusion, it is a fact that more and more people are reading online newspapers and books these days, but some people still choose to read the print out version. These two versions have their own advantages, so in my opinion people should choose in accordance to their passion. But the most important thing is that no matter what the type is, people should not stop reading, as reading give a lot of benefits for their readers.
Essay 631:
As we see nowadays the crime rate has increased comparatively and many people think that building more prisons and putting people inside for a long time will help to reduce the crime rate but actually this is not the solution in my opinion.
The first thing we need to do is to control the crime rate in the society by raising awareness in people and through positive media. The media has a very important role in raising awareness in common population through television and the Internet. The young generation is deeply influenced by the violence based movies and such movies should not me made instead positive messages should be given to the innocent minds so that tomorrow they become the useful citizens.
Another important issue is the increased use of unlicensed weapons openly in society as it is seen commonly now that on small issues people lose their tempers and don't hesitate in using guns. At the same time, security should be increased at society level like in small towns and other neglected places and security automobiles number should also be increased.
The idea of increasing the prison number and holding the criminals long time inside is not a very sensible idea because it is observed that people start making organised gangs inside the jails and sometimes become big criminals than they were ever before. Instead of wasting this money on extending the prison system Government should invest this money on beneficial plans for a nation like constructing modern hospitals, improving the pre-existing health sector and giving better education standards.
To sum up , raising awareness can make a remarkable difference in people's attitude and can decline the crime rates. this is a far better approach than increasing the number of prisons and prolonging the punishment period.
It is believed that the best way to reduce crime is by adding more prisons and making the detention period longer. To a certain point, I would agree with the idea but it is not the only way, as there are other alternatives that government could do to reduce the crime rate.
On the one hand, some people believe that by building more prisons and making a stricter detention period, it will be possible to reduce the number of crime activities. It is hoped that people will think twice before they do some criminal acts, as there are a lot of available rooms in prisons, and they could be sentenced for such a long period. For example, if the government set new regulation whereas bank robbers will be punished for a thirty-five years period of detention, then it is expected that people who plan to do this will consider all the consequences for a number of times before they rob a bank.
However, the government should notice that adding more prisons and setting a longer detention period is not the only way, as it should be integrated with other plans as well. In the common case, people do crimes because they have less skill, no money and unemployed, and as a consequence, they do some crimes for survival. Besides of the above-mentioned plan, the government should also provide skill training for low skill residents, therefore they could enter the workplace and would not think about doing some crime activities. And then, the government should also provide job opportunities for ex-prisoners, as in the general case, many of them were not accepted by the public and consequently, they returned to the crime world again.
In conclusion, to a certain extent, I agree that building more prisons and extending the sentence period would be a good plan for lowering the crime rate. But, it should also be combined with other plans such as providing skill course for the poor and create some works for ex-convicts, therefore the plan would run effectively.
Essay 633:
The economic inflation, increased unemployment and nature of businesses around the globe have made it mandatory for employees to work longer hours. The long and challenging working hours, social and economical condition and modernization have also increased the amount of stress we feel in our working places. I would say a positive and balanced lifestyle, realistic expectation and support from the employers can address this pressing issue.
First of all, managing a decent job and earning livings have become competitive nowadays. The economic inflation has made it quite tough to live a standard life and to support the family. While the 50% of the world property are owned by merely 7% of people, more than 50% people in the world have very little to support their family and children. So when they get a job they are ready to work as many hours as their employers demand to earn a living. Without a job those people will starve and they are mostly factory workers and labours who comprise the largest portion of the workforce in many countries.
There are plenty of qualified graduates who are struggling to get a job only because the competition is too high. So when someone solely relies on the salary he earns, he has to obey the rule imposed by the employers and it is not uncommon that many private organisations expect the employees to work more than 10 hours per day. The government’s lack of control in private industries in many countries is the reason why employees in these companies have to work longer hours.
The businesses nowadays are transforming to global nature and it is not rare for many companies to have offshore offices. In many technology-related companies, people are working more than 14 hours per day and remaining attached with their colleagues from home. The long working hours, job responsibility, peer pressure and sedentary lifestyle of employees are increasing the stress related issues faster than any time in history. The increased violence, corruption and crime are also the reasons many employees in the defence and public sectors suffer from stress. Interestingly the bad traffic in many cities is one of the major reasons people feel stressed while commuting to their offices.
The employers can play a great role to reduce the working hours and thus controlling the work related pressures among employees. In fact, long working hours is not a guarantee of better productivity and the employers have to understand that. They can reduce the working hours, offers leaves and support morally to keep their employees happy. The employers should understand the impact of performance between a stressed and a happy employee. Simple appreciation from an employer can make a great impact and the employers have to respect their employees not treat them as servants.
Essay 634:
Undeniably, it is a heated debate who can teach children better- parents or educators in a school? Children mimic their parents' behaviours, and I personally believe that parents roles are more influential than that of teachers in schools.
to begin with, we cannot discard the impact of education which students learn in institutions. One important factor is how much their academic knowledge can increase. Compared to parents, teachers have higher academic performance due to the amount of training they have. In particular, in science, they know more about the details of nature or technology, transferring them to their students; however, parents are not professional trainers. Furthermore, children may become less socially active if they only rely on their parents’ teaching. Communicating with the other peers in school, they can learn more about social interactions, while those studying home can become more isolated. In my case, never could I become a socially adolescent if I did not have enough communication with other classmates.
On the other hand, I agree that the role of parents in the teaching of their offspring cannot be forgotten. One reason behind it is that they are trustworthy. Definitely, because there is a closer relationship between parents and their children emotionally, there is a firmer trust between them, whereas school instructors are less trustful. As a prime example, I could not rely on the social worker working in the secondary school I studied because he was a rigid person, even in general appearance, and many students could not trust his words. Another factor is that children spend more time with their parents than the trainers in school. Obviously, parents are able to find better their probable children’s behavioural problems due to spending long hours with them. In contrast, teachers spend less time with each student, leading to missing each one’s misconduct problems.
In conclusion, the role of parents is more powerful on their children’s training than the tutors teaching in schools. From my perspective, parents are emotionally closer and have more enough time to educate their children. Had not they only taught by their parents, more educational and behavioural problems would have been left.
Essay 636:
In current years, the world of entertainment has become a highly fashionable trend. The belief that everyone is capable of doing any kind of thing in arts -music, literature, acting, art, and so on- has become a mainstream attitude. Undoubtedly, pure talent is no longer valued or appreciated as many untalented people become wealthy and popular. As regards this case, I personally disagree with this phenomena which I will further scrutinise the reasons along with related examples.
The first reason which I want to propose is the fact that people without any talent on arts will likely degrade the value of arts. As we acknowledge that arts are abstract concepts which require the sense of aesthetic from the inside and outer sides. I strongly believe that even they take certain education degree in arts, yet the nature of talent speaks louder than the nurtured ones. As the result, less talented artists most likely produce a burst of plain performances. A good example of this is the increasing number of instant artists entering the entertainment industry which basically solely requires their beautiful face and body as the prerequisites. Another reason is that this issue will deplete creativity which tends to create a soap opera instead of a masterpiece. We can see this in the recent phenomena when people just easily upload their wacky sensational video on YouTube to elevate their popularity. Indeed, there are no remarkable arts in it.
It is true that some scholars state that people without any initial talent can gain it through education both formal and informal courses. However, some other experts prove that no talent unlikely can compete with the genuine ones. For instance, Beyonce who is widely known as one of the most talented singers stays everlasting in her career rather than the YouTube’s instant artist who mostly fade away in a short time.
To sum up, I disagree that untalented people enter the entertainment industry as nature and nurture are mutually exclusive in many ways. I believe that pure talent must be more appreciated in a wider proportion.
Essay 637:
On the one hand, telecommuting has many benefits on our planet generally and our social life specifically. Firstly, telecommuting could reduce pressure on earth resources. Telecommuting commuters tend to travel less to their workplaces. As a result, this could decrease pressure on urban infrastructures like roads and public transportation services and ultimately could save natural fossil resources and decrease pollution. Secondly, working from home could modify our family relationships. People spend more time with their families and this increase family tidiness and stability. For instance, some social workers link telecommuting with decrease divorce rates in many western countries. It is a very effective way to enhance the performance of the employees and thus producing increased output for a company. This reduces the costs and ensures better profitability. One of the main objectives of technological advancement is the faster and more tasks done per hour. Telecommuting ensures this very perfectly. 
On the other hand, telecommuting could have some negative impacts. One problem is that working from home could result in many health problems. Telecommuting forces people to move less and do more desk jobs. This sedentary lifestyle could lead to many health problems like obesity. Another drawback of telecommuting is that it may affect our social life negatively. Working from home without exposure to real work life could reduce people interaction skills and could ultimately lead to social isolation.
Essay 638:
Nowadays, the role of females has thoroughly become different compared to the past. While they had to take responsibility for home duties far more than males, now their roles in the workforce has become more obvious. Some individuals might disagree with it; however, I personally believe that both genders must equally be permitted to participate in different careers.
On the one hand, the role of women was mostly catering for their children and related duties of home, and some say that this was extremely important to societies. One obvious benefit was that their children were more under control than now. Mothers had more time to raise their children and had sufficient control over their children’s behaviour, while unfortunately now they are more involved in their job and have less opportunity to have a close relationship with them. Another advantage was that this could have a positive influence on couples’ relationships, and the rate of successful marriage partners was far higher than now. For instance, in the USA, because of this change, the percentage of divorce increased dramatically, from 10% in the 1970s to just over 25% in 2000s, according to a report in a US family magazine.
On the other hand, I personally agree with the method supporting females have the identical fortune to work in different jobs. One important factor behind it is that they are and will be more talented in different fields of jobs because they are more prosperous workers or scientists. As a prime example, in space, they have a better tolerance to difficult conditions they face than the male ones. Their physiology can help them to adapt better to some weird weather conditions and they have been successful as similar as men in their job. Furthermore, it is based on humans’ rights. Apparently, all humans must be given equal opportunity to live and work, and all national organisations are trying to develop this policy. Females can have better performance in all types of jobs, especially in those linking to emotion. In this way, had not they allowed to work as a psychologist, less depressed patients would have been cured appropriately!
In conclusion, while in the past women had less role in working, now they have more crucial roles. From my point of view, it will be against the basics of humans’ rights if they are not given permission to work similar to men, and their aptitude is valuable in some specific types of jobs, far than men.
Essay 640:
It is a fact that every high school student has his/her own different capacity in terms of academic study. Some students might have good results in arts while others might be good at science or mathematics. However, despite the subject that the student likes, there are several factors that will affect to his/her achievements, and the following essay will discuss them in details.
Firstly, it is important for students to get some attention from their parents. Some parents do spend times for discussing the projects at school, share the knowledge and give some advice to their children. Many people do not realise that these kinds of simple activities could influence and motivate children in achieving their best results at school.
Secondly, teachers should not rank some subjects at school. Some teachers believe that subjects such as mathematics or sciences are more superior than arts or physical educations. This kind of attitude should be prohibited at schools, as some students might perform well at sports while others are good at literature. Instead of classifying some subjects, teachers should learn to acknowledge the talent of their students and support them.
Last but not least, high-school students should have a positive mindset. They should focus on studying all subjects that are taught at school, though some of them might not be their favourite subjects. They should understand clearly that all courses will be useful for them in the future. For example, although some students might become professional doctors in the future, it is important for them to study about accounting as well since they have to manage their own financial matters.
In conclusion, there are many factors that affect the academic success of a secondary school student. But in my opinion, the three important factors are the supportive parents, teachers’ fairness and the positive mindset of the student him/herself.
Essay 642:
Technology is permeating every aspect of human lives. This is apparent in the way in which both individuals and corporations are increasingly using technology to communicate rather than relying on the conventional face to face interactions. The advantages and disadvantages of this development will be analysed in this essay.
Essay 643:
The issue of unhealthy food in western countries has become an inevitable issue for people that influence people’s diet. Moreover, some researchers recommend those people to change their diets. I personally agree with these views.
I believe that unhealthy food in western countries is affected by the use of technology in producing food that mostly concerns on the quantity of the products as well as time efficiency but ignores the quality aspect. As a result, there are various kinds of junk food and instant food provided in several restaurants that obviously lack the nutrients as well as vitamins. Moreover, the use of technology in producing food sometimes endangers people because the food factory tends to add chemical substance inside of the food instead of natural substances. Moreover, media, through TV and printed media, play important role in persuading as well as convincing people to buy those unhealthy foods.
On the other hand, some researchers recommend people in western countries to change the diet from modern food into traditional food that naturally contains much nutrients, vitamins, minerals and calories. I believe that changing the diets will make people be avoided from the dangerous substance that influence the health. Moreover, even though people use the technology to produce as well as modify food production but by considering the importance of healthy diets people will use it effectively and safely.
In short, people in western countries are provoked by media as well as the technology use in food production that probably add chemical substance inside the food. By considering these factors, people should change the diets into the traditional food that is more natural as well as healthier.
Essay 644:
These days, it has become a fashionable trend for a country trying to develop its technology. However, at the same time, this condition has changed and made several aspects such as ability as well as the way of life ignored by society. Some argue that it will be useless to make it up or keep it sustains because automatically technology brings a lot changes to the society. Personally, I strongly disagree that technology will bring negative impacts for a country when a country tries to adapt it. I will explain that in this essay according to my opinions and views. 
Firstly, technology takes a vaccinating role in the global society, especially for a country. A country that tries to adapt technology as the foundation of lifestyle indirectly traditional aspects will improve and a country will find a platform to promote their culture globally. For example, Japan as a country shows progressive development in technology by creating many variations of technology. Japan still makes their culture known well by people around the world. At the same time, a lot of findings or creations were done by experts in Japan but traditional skills or the way of life still remain same.
Furthermore, technology helps to promote cultural and traditional aspects from a country. Today there are many countries tend to use technology to introduce their culture as well as their lifestyle in different parts of the world. For instance Indonesia, Ministry of Information and Technology succeed to promote culture and Indonesian lifestyle in South East Asia region during SEA Olympiad by using the internet and mobile television. Based on research by Indonesian media association 25,000 people reached because the way of advertising by using technology.
In conclusion, even though some people still believe that technology will change a lot of aspects of a country but I believe that technology supports a country’s development, society to be introduced, and make a country well known worldwide when a country develop technology in the right way. 
Essay 646:
It is becoming increasingly difficult to ignore the significance of road accidents and associated loss of life on the roads, especially due to rash and reckless driving by youngsters. It is clear that the number of accidents can be prevented with awareness programs so I am of the opinion that, these programs must be started at school level itself.
Essay 647:
Education is one of the essential things in people’s live because it will help us to face the globalisation era. Talking about going abroad for the study is a common thing. There are no doubts when people want to study overseas. At the first time it will make them shocked or frustrated because of the new culture of atmosphere, but then it will create many advantages. Personally, I really do agree that students should continue their study abroad rather than study at home because there are some benefits and it will produce an exciting prospect for future.
Essay 648:
Ever since the dawn of industrialisation, world’s environment has been changing in a drastic manner. Many of these changes are of negative nature. Some argue that global warming is the most serious environmental issue that we deal with, while others contend deforestation has a much more damaging impact on the earth’s environment. Both sides of this debate will be analysed in this essay before a reasoned conclusion is drawn.
Essay 649:
In recent years, there is a remarkable trend for young people to have a gap year before pursuing the higher level of education in this case entering university education. Some assert that university education is a study-level which tends to provide specialist knowledge for students. However, I personally believe that participating in a workplace or visiting other parts of countries will bring some benefits when they come to a university. Therefore, this essay will look into some reasons with some considerations.
At recent years, it has become a favourable trend for high school’s alumni to take a year break before conducting further study in university. People speculate discussing this topic causing the different notions whether this provides benefits or gives negative impacts. I believe that taking the break will give teenagers positive effects which I will elaborate below.
Essay 650:
In Today's world status of a person is judged by the car he drives, the branded clothes he wears, branded phone he owns, the posh place he stays in and so on. It has become an endless battle which never going to stop because there is no end to it.
In order to appear cooler in front of other people and to achieve more and more comfort people have become more and more materialistic and money minded. They have lost their traditional values with this mind shift. It has gone so deep into the value system of present generation that it has become very difficult to understand the value of people and relationships.
The desire to rise in their career which is considered good have bound people to leave their cities, even their countries to move and settle in different developed cities and countries. People sometimes leave their families, values and beliefs. They do that so that they can enjoy the comfortable lifestyle and afford homes in posh cities, buy luxurious brands. This is good as long as they lead a balanced life and don't let materialism corrupt their mindset. However, it has been seen that people who get used to the luxurious lifestyle may often leave their families, especially their old parents alone who took care of them during childhood. For them, a relationship doesn't hold much importance but money and materialism do. They get fascinated and value people who are leading the lifestyle they admire rather than respecting and loving their loved ones.
This not only shows people in the modern world have become self-centered and selfish but also show how hollow can one person’s thought process be. They never realise even after spending lots and lots of money in the rat race of comfort and materialism they are still unhappy and lonely from deep inside. Even worse, in some cases, they have lost the love of their loved ones whom they left alone.
I believe people need to be ambitious but they should not forget to remain grounded. Because if you are grounded you can still enjoy the comfortable life you always wanted to lead but you end up valuing the relationship and traditional values more than materialism which has not substance/life.
Essay 651:
Money cannot guarantee people's happiness. It is proved by experts that although economic growth has made people richer, people from developed countries feel less happy than they were before. In contrast, in poor countries, wealth make them happier. I will outline the reason why this phenomenon happened.
In the case of developed countries, they are never starving. In the past, they can found meal everywhere and able to bought it. Before technology advanced, they already went to work such as farming or work in a factory. They had enough money to prevent them from starving. Another reason is the time of working. They worked several hours and have time to take a rest. Meanwhile, in recent year, they work overlap time hours. They have no time to do their interest or go on vacations with their family. It is because of competition among people. Their ambition encourages them to pursue their goal and achievement for enhancing their status.
On the other hand, residents of developing countries feel happier than they were before because they ever lived in a lack of education and food. In the past, it was really hard for them to buy some food and studied in formal education. But today, since they are richer than before, they can get both of those terms. They can buy an important stuff for their life. Another reason is they can manage their time working well, so they still have time to interact with other people.
In conclusion, I must say that what we can learn about two cases above is to love our life. It is true that we need to work and earn money for our life but it cannot be denied that we need to enjoy our life with our lovely people. So, we need to thanks for everything we have and we got.
Essay 652:
The world economy has improved significantly in the past few years and made several people become wealthier in both advanced and developing countries. Based on the research, it is found that people who live in developing countries are enjoying their lives more than before nowadays, while those who live advanced countries are no happier that before. The following essay will discuss in details about some of the reasons and what can we learn from it.
On the one hand, it is a fact the world economic has grown rapidly in the past recent years. Many developing and developed countries have experienced some positive improvements in the economic sectors, as their GDP have increased and inflation rate got lower. Some of the people have taken the advantage and as a consequence, they became richer. The economic growth has created a lot of new billionaires these days, such as the CEO of Air Asia Tony Fernandez and the Mital Family from India.
Based on some scientific studies, it is found that people who live in developing countries are happier than ever nowadays, as their economic condition has grown rapidly in the past few years. As some of the people’s lives and economic status have changed dramatically from poor to middle-income class, they felt grateful and pleased with the improvement and enjoyed their lives. In contrast to the condition above, developed countries’ people are no happier than they were before. Should there be any improvement in their economic status, it would not give any significant changes into their way of lives, as they already have a high standard of living. Many of them already have their own properties and vehicles, and their government already provided them with good public health, education and transportation system. Therefore it is harder for them to feel grateful in terms of their economic condition.
In conclusion, it is true that the world economic have grown rapidly in the past few decades, and it has made some of the people in developing and developed countries become wealthier. Is it reported that as the economic sector in developing countries are growing, the people are feeling are happier than ever before, as many of them have experienced drastic changes in their ways of living. Many of them have successfully escaped from poverty problems and change their economic status. On the other hand, many people who live in advanced countries are no happier than before, as they already live in a better and comfort situation.
Essay 653:
At recent years, the economic conditions have been developed in all countries in the world. However, it seems that developing countries have better achievement in increasing their happiness indicator rather than developed countries. There are several things that can be learned from this phenomenon and I will try to elaborate them in this essay.
Psychologically, rich countries have achieved their economic peak describing the massive productivity and superiority in well-known thrived multinational industries and by the time passed by the stagnancy occurred. Dissimilar with it, emerging countries have been trying so hard to pursue the enrollment in economy indicators, and as a result, they achieved them and easily felt happy with the overwhelming results. This is the dire impact for developed countries because they are afraid by the economy theory stating there will be always a victim in economic competition.
Apart from that, developing countries have been thriving so fast by fixing their government expenditure, increasing and improving the environment of local businesses which drive the huge number of investments. As results, there is up-going growth in employment indicators and an improvement in individual spending because they have revenues by huge working opportunities. These happen in China, Brazil, Indonesia, and India. Meanwhile, developed countries such America, Japan, and European Industrial Countries have maximised the usage of their resources so they are encouraged to develop their factories overseas by outsourcing the workers from local developing countries which give benefits for poor countries in many ways.
In conclusion, the theory of “economy cycle” driven by business cycle theory is inevitable arguing that a country who has reached the maximum outcomes in economy, will suffer a daunt fall whether it will be significant or steady is based on the effective efforts by the country.
Essay 655:
Annually, a wide range of students in all around the world, graduating from high schools, are excited that how they could achieve their greatest successes by experiencing in academic life. Thus, the remarkable question taking shape in individuals’ mind is that what key factors could lead them to acquire such greatest benefits in universities. It is supposed to be discussed these crucial ingredients in the following paragraphs.
As the most considerable element in the way of finding success in academic life is that the students choose the best field of study, which they are really interested in; Above all, they are talented in that. To put it simply, the more their field matches with their conviction, the more chance they could have to make their future professional life. In this way, the parents and teachers could play a pivotal role in clarifying the students` talents.
Another chief agent in this matter is the quality of university which student apply in. According to a diversity of institutes and universities, it could be important to find an adequate place that offers the student facilities ranging from academics to educational equipment.
As the last point, it should be noted that taking advantage of a suitable situation for studying at home and university alike, could contribute to students concentrate on their subjects and possess opportunities to do widely research in their field.
In conclusion, there is no doubt that graduating from high school and beginning an academic life could be a great honour for both students and their families. However, it would not be achieved the tremendous successes without paying heed to the decisive elements which some of those were briefly stated in the above paragraphs.
Essay 657:
As people have paid taxes to the government, it is believed that they should be provided with free healthcare and qualified education. However, others disagree with the statement, as they think that each individual should be responsible for his or her own health and education. The following essay will discuss both views in details.
On the one hand, many people believe that it is the government's responsibility to provide standard health care and decent education to their people. As people have paid income taxes, property taxes, value added taxes and other kinds of fees to the government, these funds should also be beneficial for the people as well. Some portions of the budget should be allocated to fund medical activities and educational programs. Having a lot of educated and healthy residents brings many benefits for the government, as there are a lot of skill and productive labours in the country who would develop the country's economic sector.    
On the other hand, some people believe that health and education is a personal matter as it is the responsibility of each individual to maintain own their health and education. They disagree if education and healthcare should be funded from the taxes. They think that it is unfair because some people might be working hard and paid a large amount of taxes, but others might be indolent or jobless and get the same benefits from the government. Therefore they believe that healthcare and education should be standalone institutions, and each people should pay for getting a good education and maintaining their own health.
In conclusion, to a certain point, I would agree that it is the government's task to provide education and healthcare for their people, as some poor people might not be able to get a good education and decent healthcare. However, although these services might be provided by the government for free, each individual's must be responsible for their own education and healthcare, as these services are funded by taxes that are paid by the public.
Essay 658:
In today's world, healthcare and education are two most important parts of people's life. Further, without proper education and sufficient health care system, a country can’t develop. However, the government has the responsible to create a healthy nation.  Personally, I believe that the government should provide basic needs to create a  healthy life and an educated nation independently. 
Everyone prefer to have a fascinating life, but we cannot do whatever we want.  Therefore, we have sacrificed some, such as drugs, tobacco, alcohol, and junk foods etc.  for a healthy life. In the present days, people are busy with their day to day work. As a result majority of them are not having balanced diets and some of them take fast food or junk food. They do not concern health and also it will cause many diseases in future.  For example, obesity, diabetes etc  Further, from the young age everyone should concern about their health. Especially people not only should think about the physical health but also consider the mental health.
That is why the government should provide better health care and education for all citizens. The government is created by the taxes from valuable workforces of their country. Therefore, the government has the responsibility to offer them free health care facilities, heath education programme: such as healthy diet, clinics or hospitals for free medicine, etc. Further, the government can use social media to distribute health and education programme. Because nowadays, the majority of people are connected in social media. For example facebook, twitter etc. In addition, the government should implement such a law in order to increase a balanced lifestyle. For instance, due to the overpopulation of China, they have limited only one child for one family.
In conclusion, when I consider all given points it is clear that only the government cannot make a healthy nation. Therefore, individuals should have concerns to prevent future health issues. However, the government should enforce such a law in order to increase our standard of lifestyle and also provide basic needs to the people who are expected from the government. In fact, in my opinion, the government and individuals are both responsible for building a healthy nation.
Essay 660:
Since the dawn of time, technology has been advancing. For the past years, it introduced latest models to the public market. It is agreed that some people will always want to buy the newest model a technology has to offer for reasons such as happiness, passion about new technology, status, getting advanced features and socialisation. These reasons will now be analysed.
For one, many people want to purchase new things for happiness. For example, my boyfriend has given me the latest iPhone 6 plus from the apple company. It has always been my dream to have this and so this gave the ultimate happiness I have never experienced in my entire life. This makes it clear that buying new products will make people satisfied.
In addition to this, it makes people more sociable. For instance, with the apple iPhone 6 plus my loved one has given me, I can now connect to my friends and relatives whether here in the Philippines or abroad through using Facebook, Integra and yahoo messenger accounts anytime and anywhere. It is obvious from this that buying new technology will make people sociable.
New technology always comes with advanced features and people want the best tools to do their tasks. For example, a new computer or laptop comes with more storage capacity and other advancement and facilities that often allure a person to buy the latest model though s/he already has one.
People often purchase new models of technological devices as part of their status. For instance, someone who has a car that completely satisfies the needs of this person would want to buy the latest model always. They prefer status over needs.
In conclusion, for reasons like being happy, advanced technology, more features, ease of use, passion and more sociable, people want the latest products advanced technology has to offer. These reasons are good for some people. So it is recommended to buy newest products as long as you can afford them.
Essay 662:
In many countries, especially in developing countries, foreign movies are more popular than the locally made films. There are several reasons for this trend and the government can and should greatly contribute to promoting domestic movies for the overall progress of the industry.
The main reason people prefer movies from other countries is the quality of the movie. It is often noticed that locally made films in many countries lack better plots and the characters do not have the necessary depth to touch the hearts of the audiences. Moreover, foreign films have a great variation and they are more enjoyable than the domestic films. This happens because large film industries like the Hollywood can allocate a huge budget and have talented producers and directors while films made in developing countries have a small amount to spend on a movie and do not have many talented movie makers. For instance, the type of animated movies and special effects developing countries produce these days are unimaginable in most of the developing countries and this is why movie lovers from these countries prefer to watch movies made in other countries. The poor quality of acting and low-budget filmmaking in most of the developing countries discourage the audiences to enjoy local films.
In my opinion, the government should support the film industry in order to support this industry, encourage people to enjoy more domestically produced films and gain international acclimation for quality movies. Each country has some talented producers, actors and filmmakers who for the lack of financial and political support cannot bring out the best. They should be given a chance to prove themselves. No doubt big budget is required to make better quality films and the government should provide subsidiary to help local film industry progress. Government’s help for the movie industry would bring more audiences to the theatre to enjoy those films and earn more ticket money. Moreover, quality films would compete in international stages and bring fame for the country.
It is a fact that in many countries, people prefer to watch foreign films rather than the local ones. There are various reasons that have caused the situation and the following essay will discuss them and how governments should react in details.
For a number of reasons, a lot of people prefer to watch foreign movies than the locally produced ones. Firstly, they believe that overseas films have higher quality in terms of visual effects and audio. For instances, films such as Batman or Spiderman had been watched by people all over the world, due to their sophisticated digital effects. Secondly, many people choose to watch foreign films due to the poor quality of the local actors and actresses. They think that these local artists could not play their role in the maximum capacity which negatively impacts on the films' quality.
There are some things that governments should do in order to improve the quality of the local film. Governments could give some scholarships for their best actors and actresses to study further about acting in foreign countries. And then, governments could play their role as a mediator between the local and overseas producers. They could cooperate in producing films, therefore local producers could learn how to generate high-quality films. It is believed that these things would give positive effects to the local film industry.
In conclusion, instead of watching local films, many people choose to watch overseas ones. They believe that overseas films are better than local ones in all aspects. Governments should respond to the condition by sending their best actors and actresses to study acting overseas and by cooperating with foreign film producers. By doing these kinds of things it is hoped there will be improvements for local film industries.
Essay 663:
It is true that foreign films are more popular in many countries than domestically produced films. There could be several reasons why this is the case, and I believe that governments should promote local film-making by subsidising the industry.
There are various reasons why many people find foreign films more enjoyable than the films produced in their own countries. Firstly, the established film industries in certain countries have huge budgets for action, special effects and to shoot scenes in spectacular locations. Hollywood blockbusters like 'Avatar' or the James Bond films are examples of such productions, and their global appeal is undeniable. Another reason why these big-budget films are so successful is that they often star the most famous actors and actresses, and they are made by the most accomplished producers and directors. The poor quality, low-budget filmmaking in many countries suffers in comparison.
In my view, governments should support local film industries financially. In every country, there may be talented amateur film-makers who just need to be given the opportunity to prove themselves. To compete with big-budget productions from overseas, these people need money to pay for film crews, actors and a host of other costs related to producing high-quality films. If governments did help with these costs, they would see an increase in employment in the film industry, income from film sales, and perhaps even a rise in tourist numbers. New Zealand, for example, has seen an increase in tourism related to the 'Lord of the Rings' films, which were partly funded by government subsidies.
In conclusion, I believe that increased financial support could help to raise the quality of locally made films and allow them to compete with the foreign productions that currently dominate the market.
Essay 664:
In many countries, foreign films such as Hollywood or Bollywood films are more popular than the locally produced ones.  And to cope with the problem, governments should provide financial support for domestic film producers. The following essay will discuss in details about the issue and how governments should resolve it.
For a number of reasons, a lot of people choose to watch imported films than the domestic ones these days. Firstly, these people believe that quality of overseas actors is better than the locals. These people think that foreign actors could maximise their acting abilities and play their character well, therefore it would positively affect the quality of the film. Secondly, audio visual technologies that are used by the local producers are left behind than the overseas ones. It is undeniable that foreign films have used modern and high technology techniques, which have created unique and astonishing visual effects.
To solve the issue, governments should have some strategies and action plans. One of the things that governments could do is to provide subsidies for the local film producers. The subsidy could be used by these movie makers for upgrading their tools and equipment, therefore they could improve the graphic and sound quality of the films. And then governments could provide scholarships for local actors to study acting overseas. By studying overseas, it is hoped these actors could learn from world class actors and improve their acting quality.
In conclusion, many people choose to watch foreign movies than the domestic ones due to the overseas ones are better in term of acting and visual effect quality. However, there are several things that governments could do to solve the problem, and one of them is to provide financial support for local film producers and actors.
Essay 665:
Film industry flourished dramatically over the last few years. Technological advancements have made a big contribution to the success of this industry. Countries such as India, USA etc. are highly dependent on this industry. Their governments are financially supporting to achieve better and long lasting result. They are in the process of sticking people to watch their own locally produced movies. However, with the easy access to foreign movies and because of low-quality local movies people nowadays prefer watching foreign movies more often. This has become a global phenomenon and both movie viewers and the government should patronise the growth of local movies according to many.
There are several reasons for the shift in term of watching movies. Nowadays, people are smarter; they do not want to waste their time and money for an ordinary movie. They want quality movies, which have big casts, good camera works, emotions and suspense. In addition to this, they want something new and unique. This is why they are pursuing towards foreign films.
Lack of funds is one of the vital reasons in competing with other movie industries. People are reluctant to work in local films because they have been paid very less. These people try to find their career in other countries because of high income and appreciation. The government should support their local film industry in order to equip with the latest technology such as cameras, software and training. The good work of celebrities should be acknowledged and awarded by the government, this will encourage good people to join and serve for this industry. The government should also restrict the piracy of movies and promote the local movies to help flourish the local movies.
Essay 666:
In recent years, working children have become a trending issue in all parts of the world. People considering the issue separate into two sides whether it is totally wrong or it is needed for the children to improve their capabilities. This essay will try to elaborate these both views with appropriate considerations.
On one hand, children are weaker in view aspects such as physically, mentally, psychologically, etc. that influence them suffering severe problems. They also lack the acknowledgements and experiences in workplace surrounded by job deadlines, congested responsibilities, and competitive working environment that cause further dire matters. Furthermore, they become an alibi and abuse by irresponsible people achieving numerous benefits and profits by using children to get pity in workload, and this happens in certain developing countries.
On the other hand, children who work will more appreciate the life values and gain huge experiences. By receiving money from hard work, they will not spend it buying unimportant things. They will be mature faster and obtain more wisdom rather than other children who are naturally childish in that period. As a consequence, they will be more serious to pursue their future life throughout prior efforts.
In my opinion, the benefits of childhood-age working outweigh the drawbacks. To overcome the negative sides, formal education should provide curricula with the practical and paid working programmes accompanied by parents and educators to gain maximum outcomes.
To sum up, even though it is inevitable that there are risks for children to get involved in working environment, the positive sides deserve to be maximised by setting educational formula for children which also can minimise the drawbacks.
In recent days, it is quite common for some children join in some workplaces in several nations. Some assert that it poses bad impacts towards the children behaviour while the others believe that it is a remarkable chance to educate children to be a responsible person. This essay will look into both views with some considerations.
People do realise that being a worker is not appropriate for children since they are still in the early age. People assert that they should enjoy their childhood first instead of participating in paid work. This is the time for them to play around together with their peers thus they will create some beautiful moments which are full of happiness in their age. In term of psychology, it develops them to be an introvert person and suffer from the social communication. They will tend to be mature earlier because they realise how hard life is. Therefore, they will lose their childhood which might never repeat again.
On the other hand, there are some benefits for children to work on early age. First, it enables to be an independent person because they can earn money by their own.  Moreover, it educates them to be a responsible person because of their experiences. They will learn time management and problem-solving during working. As a result, they will be more ready to face this life even it poses a great help for them in the future since they have plenty of knowledge in that field.
It is true that children will more respect and realise the meaning of this life since they already cope with some problems. However, it will affect their behaviour and culture identity. They will have different perspectives from their peers about this kind of life. Moreover, it will interfere their educations because of spending much time on working.
To sum up, work for children can be a positive or negative thing, thus the role of parents and teachers are quite necessary to develop the children's character. As a result, children will not lose their childhood, but they are still able to gain an opportunity to work.
Essay 667:
Traffic congestion is one of the most serious problems in big cities and it has made people’s lives more difficult. Thirty years ago, there were fewer cars on the street and people did not suffer from traffic. Today, however, streets are full of cars, buses and trucks. This essay will analyse the most important causes of traffic congestion and will explain the effects of it.
Several factors have contributed to the problem of traffic in big cities. The most significant factor is the high number of cars. Today, companies manufacture a large number of cars and it is pretty easy for people to have one. Furthermore, many families own two or three cars which result in the increase of traffic congestion. Another contributing factor is the lack of public transports. For example, there are very few subway systems in my hometown, Tehran, and bus system is inconvenient and inefficient. Therefore, people use their own cars even in rush hours. The last cause is road system. Most of the streets in my city are narrow and few cars can pass through them simultaneously.
The problem of traffic has several effects on people and city. The most significant effect is increased anger and frustration. Every day, people experience a delay in reaching their workplaces or universities. This leads to high tension and stress among them. Another feasible effect worth mentioning here is the environmental effect. The quality of air declines because of the exhaust fumes generated by cars which may result in severe health problems such as asthma, bronchitis and heart attacks. The waste of time on average is huge and this is another major drawback the bad traffic is causing.
Overall, traffic is mainly caused by overpopulation and people’s reliance on their own cars. If governments provide more facilities and encourage people to use public transport, I am sure that the level of traffic will decline in the near future.
Essay 668:
At recent years, there is an ongoing debate whether by completing further study in university or by joining the workload directly will lead someone to be employed in a good job. I personally believe that continuing higher study in a course at a university will alleviate the opportunity to get involved in the labour market.
The light competitiveness in work field, in some ways, increases the need for qualified workers. Moved by this trigger, universities develop the quality of the students by improving the specialisations and by extending the variety of courses. Taken as an example, business courses have been expanding the field of study in a wide range of majors such as public health business which provides the participants to focus on hospital management, pharmacy business, etc. or social based entrepreneur which develops the candidates to build their social-based businesses by a small amount of money.
On the other hand, undeniably, students in university seem to be the lack of practical experiences in working environment. Being an employee means more of responsibilities, job deadlines, etc. and there are several consequences if they show bad performances. To solve this case, internship programmes and core soft skill training can be effective ways out. University faces challenges to keep improving the curricula in order to prepare the students with work experiences by entering the utmost graduate students with 3 months working programmes in thrived companies as well as with several working skills training such as leadership training.
Nowadays, many people believe that education in university level is the only way to get a good job. In contrast, some people think that working after high school is better since they can obtain experience in work environment. I will outline both issues with reasons and examples.
Talking about a good job, it is not easy to achieve. We have to prepare ourselves both in terms of education and skill because they need to cooperate to make a good capability in ourselves, which we know as a prior thing that employers seek in the employees. For example, in the case of a job interview, employer commonly ask about our last education whether it is appropriate for the job position or not. They believe that higher education provides people not only in knowledge term but also their maturity.
Furthermore, through university education, we are not only given subsequences of theories but also practices. So, before we go to the work field, we already know how to adapt to our expected job based on our background education.
It is true that we need experiences to do better in our job, but it cannot be denied that education is more important than it. Take a teacher’s career as an example. By teaching earlier, you may have more experience than the new one who just graduated from university. But graduated university students can teach their students with better theories or concept from each material with good methods.
To sum up, I must say that we need higher education to gain more information from the experts about our special field, therefore we can do our best to show our capability in front of employers to emphasise them that we deserve that job. So, I tend to disagree that work after school is better than to continue our study at university.
In recent days, there are some people prefer to work directly after graduating from the secondary school instead of pursuing higher level education. They assert that they will obtain some experiences in the workplace, and it develops them to be an independent person. However, I personally disagree about this point because people need the university education to gain a bright future career. This essay will look into the reasons.
To survive in the globalisation era, people need to have higher education. People who enter university education will be more ready to face the world competition. The university education tries to provide skills which are needed for some occupations. It is also supported by a wide knowledge that is obtained by students. They will more understand their study theoretically and practically. For instance, university tends to provide a variety of study fields which pose a great help for people to master their study. Moreover, they will be taught and guided by professional lecturer even some professors who expert in that study. Therefore, it will be full of useful for students.
In addition, university education is the main requirement to gain a better job. It is proved by some companies which prefer to recruit those people who have an academic certificate of bachelor degree instead of secondary level. It is caused by the employers believe that university education already provides professional people. It is supported by the longer time of study thus the people are ready to involve in the workplace.
It is true that it enables people to earn money and learn from their experiences for those who prefer to work directly. However, they lack the theoretical knowledge and cannot gain a good job as same as the higher level students. There will have more opportunities for those graduating from a university rather than that from the secondary level.
The ultimate aim for some people continuing their study to university is to get an appropriate job after being a scholar. However, other people believe that it is better to start working after they graduate from senior high school in order to gain experience in the field of work. These views have become an inevitable issue in recent years. Through this essay, I want to argue that we are going to be more acceptable in a job market after completing the study in university.
In general, there are two main reasons why I believe that a scholar can get a job easily. The first reason is that the university provides various kinds of lectures as well as use practical teaching in order to create skilled graduates. Moreover, the students in university are trained to be talented graduates that will make them easier to enter the job market.
The second reason is that university tends to cooperate with company, state and private companies, to absorb the workers from the fresh graduates. In fact, some universities conduct annual job exhibition program in their campus as the opportunity for graduates entering the job market. In addition, some companies are invited to present their profiles in university freely. It also opens a wider opportunity for graduates.
It is true that having more experience since senior high school is good, however, in recent years most of the companies tend to recruit at least a university graduate or scholar as their employers. In addition, even though there is an opportunity for senior high school graduates in a job market but they are probably put as the office boy or do not get a strategic position as the university graduates do.
To sum up, the cooperation between university and company to conduct research or provide employment is such a valuable benefit for students in university to get a job easily and the lectures in university provide several skills for them.  
Essay 669:
To be very honest, being a bilingual has an enormous positive impact on individual personality & confidence. As it gives you more and more global view of different cultures, at the same time one can relate things better in various geographies.
On contrary to this, learning multiple languages, may not provide the relevant cultural aspect of the nation. For instance, I had learned English as a language subject in my school, apart from my native language "Hindi". In a broader aspect, it doesn't help me understand British culture at all and their mindset for others.
To support this view, one may assume that, if you learn any language different from your native one, you knowingly/unknowingly go through the history and society needs of that country to make your learning of language easy to remember.
At the same time, the thought of making is mandatory for everyone to learn one additional language is certainly a curriculum based need. It will definitely boost the analytical skills of students, as they think & learn in both languages. The best part is learning any other language, which is being widely used globally by people, will help you to work & live in the most part of the world. Like, I had learned English in my school & I can work & live in the most part of the world.
To conclude, knowing multiple languages is an addition to your personality & work profile, but it does not give much insight of others society and viewpoint unless one study their history or live there for some time.
Essay 670:
I believe learning of a foreign language for all students should be compulsory at all primary schools. I would like to highlight the advantages it will have and the potential benefits it will offer if the teaching is made mandatory.
In primary school students actually get the chance to learn new and variety of subjects. Primary school is the best place for a student to learn any new skill or language because their mind can be moulded easily at that time. This new language will eventually become their second natural language like other natural activities like brushing their teeth or riding a bicycle.
I believe learning a foreign language offers an insight into how people from that culture think and see the world from different perspective. In India, there are around 29 states and around 42 languages are spoken by people from diversified culture and religion. English was a foreign language to Indians once but this is very commonly used nowadays. A common language could help people of India to understand the insights from different culture/ religions and express and share their own views. They later emphasised to include English in the curriculum in the primary itself. Sooner it became the most commonly spoken language in India which all could understand and comprehend. This has immensely helped in development in India as a nation.
Speaking and understanding a foreign language not only helps in exchanging thoughts and ideas without any hassle but also helps in solving problems and fight global issues with ease. Let's say China has a global problem of high population and major unemployment. The USA is facing the problem of high manufacturing cost. They need people who can work for less money in manufacturing their goods like iPhone at low rates so that the US can earn more profit. To solve this issue if people of china can negotiate and comprehend in English they have bigger chance to solve their problem of unemployment and Secure the deal compared to people who don't speak & understand English. This Thing will not only help the US to earn more profits but will also help china to increase their GDP once the US invests in China.
Studying and learning something a foreign language at an earlier age is the best time to learn and retain information for a longer period of Time. Skill in a foreign language not only helps people securing better job opportunities, global exposure and getting a perspective from people across the world but also help them bridge gaps in understanding their problems and providing solutions and vice versa.
It is true that by learning other country’s language, we could learn various types of new traditions and cultures. Therefore it is believed that the study of foreign language should become a compulsory course at all elementary schools. I personally agree with the statement as it would become a valuable asset for the children, and the following essay will discuss it in details.
Essay 671:
Immigration with the aim of achieving better lifestyle has become one of the most considerable discussions among developed countries, over recent decades. To clarify, this phenomenon has widely led to serious threats to hosts from a diversity of aspects which it is going to be evaluated in the following paragraphs.
As the beginning impact of immigrants, it could be stated that the host government face a variety of population difficulties. By the way of illustration, it must be supplied a widespread accommodation for the new citizens, which costs a great deal of expenses for the government.
The second problem stemming from this issue is that the immigrants from various countries have experienced different cultures, in contrast to developed countries. As a result, the cultural differences could cause minus effects on the host, especially on juveniles. These effects could contribute to decreasing the national motivation.
As the last point, undoubtedly, the immigration issue is notified as one of the countries` major commitments in terms of the human rights. Therefore, the developed nations try to maintain their positive images in international communities. This could be evaluated in order to rate the countries in United Nations from the aspect of humanitarianism.
In conclusion, the numerous challenges result from immigration of people living in developing countries, ranging from population control to the worldwide feedbacks from human right perspective. Despite these facts, many countries have still kept open their borders to immigrants.
Essay 673:
In today's world majority of young adults are looking for freedom and are try to live without parents, but some of them wish to stay long with their parents as much as they can. Personally, I believe that it is better for all concerned if young adults can continue living with their parents and families for a long time, particularly, till they finish their education or get married.
First of all, after becoming an adult, it is best for everyone to head out to embrace our independence. Although it is the most important part to consider finance, because when young adults leave their parents, they face unexpected problems and they have to earn money for the cost of living. For instance, for foods, rent, utilities, and health and other insurance etc. Furthermore, if they are studying they should work hard and study to build their future rather than doing part time jobs that might hamper their education.
In Advance, not only the finances but also they should consider the study potential. Whoever prefer to live with their parents and they believe without any pressure they can spend their youth with more freedom than the others. Because they do not worry about rent, food, work etc. Only they need to focus on their studies. Therefore, they get enough sleep as a benefit. In a competitive society, this is the hardest age to pass, for the reason that some young adults have only seen some external views of independent life. From my experiences in university life one of my friends lived in a share accommodation and had fun and party time in her whole university life, but at the end of the year she had to struggle with her studies and had to stay a long time in university to complete her studies. Until they get bad experiences from life some of them remain blind to see the real world.
In conclusion, when I consider both arguments it is clear that if young adults live with their families they can get more benefits than the young who live a free life without families. In addition, those who lives with parents get well protection and parents’ guide to enter the right track to reach their life goals. 
Essay 675:
It is true that women in recent years have been given an equal opportunity as men to participate in some areas such as politics, education etc. They are given 3% quota in members of house representative in my country, Indonesia, and the numbers of women who enter the schools are getting higher and higher every year. However, there are some areas that societies still restrict the equality between men and women. I will discuss further this issue through the essay.
I believe that women are still seen as the weak person in the classical stereotype in traditional people, particularly in some remotes area. The traditional way of thinking still believes that women should stay at home and do some house works such as washing clothes, cooking some food, cleaning the house as well as growing the children. This condition tends to restrict the freedom of women to enter the higher education as well as participate more in political area or economical area. The case of Indonesia women migrant labour, moreover, who get violence from the boss also proves that gender equality has not been accommodated yet. People tend to suppose that women are weak and men are the superiority who have more power that women which lead to the case of violence done by men to women.
Some people believe that the idea of gender equality has been approved through the policy of 30% quota in the political position, however, this kind of policy is unfair considering the number of women right now three times bigger than that of men. This policy is not representative enough.
To sum up, the idea of gender equality should be upheld comprehensively in all sectors of life. It should be supported by government through balanced policy without discriminating such kind of gender.
In recent days, it is quite common for women to involve in several areas such as workplace and governmental institutions and this is totally different from the past decades. Some assert that it is easy for women to participate in some kinds of environment. However, some people believe that women cannot gain the gender equality because there is still injustice with the women position. I totally disagree with this viewpoint and this essay will look into the reasons.
The first reason is that women have similar rights to men nowadays. There is no gap between men and women because they have equal accesses to contribute to society. As a fact that there are many women who involve in workplaces even some of them gain an important position such as an employer in certain company. It proves that women have a leadership capability as same as men. Moreover, people think that men are stronger than women thus they cannot take position equal to man. However, I personally believe that women already have the same capacity as men. Take military service as an example, women recently join in military such as police and army. Therefore, there is no reason to say that women cannot reach something like men do.
In addition, women nowadays have freedom to express their opinions even becoming the agent of change. There are plenty of women as the representative of government such as being a politician even ministers or presidents. As the result, the power of women and men are similar to the government position.
It is true that women sometimes are restricted to be a leader for some case such as being a decision maker in the family life. However, the involvement of women in some parts of society proves that they have an equal position and power in this world.
In summary, it is not hard for women to obtain education and pursue their career nowadays. They even are able to be a great member of society. Therefore, both men and women are in the equality of gender because they have the same rights in this life.
The existence of women in major sections of the society has given big changes over the past 50 years in many societies across the world. However, these societies cannot state that they have obtained gender equality. I personally disagree with this statement based on several facts that happen in my country.
In Indonesia, since the action that has been done by R. A. Kartini (an activist of gender equality many years ago), many people show appreciation to women due to what women can actually do for their country in general. As it seen for the past 15 years, the positions of women in politics are increasing. Indonesia's people have experienced  being led by a woman as their president, women as mayors in some cities and also many activists today are women. This shows that people have accepted and can claim that they already gained gender equality to a larger extent.
Moreover, not only in politics and social actions that women made changes on but also in education and entrepreneurship. There are numbers of women who get into higher and higher level of education. We can see this phenomenon in schools or colleges where the percentages of female students are higher than male students. It contradicts the situation in the past in which only males could experience formal education. The number of women in charge also increases in entrepreneurship. There are many CEO or manager spread inside this country from small company to the biggest one.
To sum up, it is true that there are still many violent happen against women, prostitution including underage women and also murder cases to women all over the world that indicating inequality of gender, but the percentage of women in politics and other aspects of society has proven that society has claimed the achievement of gender equality.
Essay 676:
Technology has revolutionised the way human beings go about their daily life. This is evident from the fact that many people nowadays work from the comfort of their homes. Some argue that this practice brings with its myriad of benefits, while others refute this. Both sides of this debate will be analysed in this essay before a reasoned conclusion is reached.
On the one hand, working from home can save an employer office rental costs to a great degree. For example, Sydney, Australia is one such place where the costs of renting an office space have risen to exorbitant levels in the past few decades. As a result, a large proportion of employers’ funds have to be devoted to this area, and this encumbers their ability to earn a decent profit. When looking at the discussion in this light, the merits of working from one’s home are clearly seen.
On the other hand, many contend that drawbacks of working from home outweigh its benefits. For instance, a recent British study found that majority of the people working from home had trouble meeting deadlines that were set by their organisations. This habitual lateness can lead to failure to the achievement of organisational goals. Thus, it is obvious why many people do not support the notion of working from home.
After pondering upon both sides of this argument, it is felt that working from home is much more of a positive development than negative. It is thus hoped that people and organisations will continue to reap the bounties of working from home into the foreseeable future.
These days, there are a lot of people who do their work from home; either it is a part-time or a full-time job. People have argued about it, as some of them believe that working from home has many advantages while others do not agree with it. The following essay will discuss in details about it, but in some circumstances, I would agree if working from home some benefits for employee and employers themselves.
Essay 677:
The animal right has been a controversial issue ever since the dawn of industrialisation. Some argue that animals deserve to be treated the same way as humans, while others contend that humans must employ animals to fulfil their numerous needs. Both points of views will be analysed in this essay before a reasoned conclusion is drawn.
On the one hand, fair treatment of animals appears to be the moral thing to do. For example, animal rights activists groups have repeatedly performed studies that demonstrate that animals, when subjected to macabre conditions of slaughterhouses and laboratories, feel the pain in the same manner as human beings. Since most humans would never support the idea of inflicting such pain on their fellow human beings, it is only fair that animals should also be spared from this torment. When looking at this side of the argument, it is obvious why some support this stance.
On the other hand, many people opine that animals should be exploited in order to fulfil a number of human needs including food and research activities. Take pharmaceutical industry, for example, if humans stop testing drugs on animals to ensure their safety for subsequent human use, fatal damage could be caused to human beings as a result of using unsafe medicines. As without such medicines, the life expectancy of humans can fall dramatically, it is understandable why this point of view has garnered support.
Although both sides of this argument have indisputable virtues, it is felt that animal exploitation should only be upheld for medical research purposes. It is hoped, that animal sufferings in the laboratories will be minimised in the future.
Essay 678:
There are arguments to suggest that online activities have detrimental effects for youngsters. Although some people are not convinced on this perspective, it can be argued that World Wide Web has a considerable number of repercussions that affect lives of children.
Primarily, it is widely believed that there are lots of unsuitable materials that may appear on the computer screen. It might be the case that children would access pornographic websites, which can depict depraved insights in their behaviour. This behaviour can be shown to those teenagers who are highly exposed to pornographic film, thus their perceptions towards women become eccentric. To illustrate, a higher incidence of rape intent has attributed to some teenagers, and studies have shown that perverted films have a blatant relevance on the way they act in the society.
In addition, it can never be denied that the innovation of the internet such as improvement in the communication system has made some youngsters to become preoccupied in a virtual socialisation. There is a school of thought that believes that teenagers, nowadays, do not partake in a face to face interaction because of the convenience that social media such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram can provide. In some occasions, teenagers might think that social media has very useful applications, which make conversations more interesting. For example, there is some social media that can delineate emoticons and video messages that appear to more entertaining to the young group. Furthermore, the sedentary nature of internet appears to have a great influence on their health. Not only does it restrict to an actual conversation, it also encourages some children to avoid engaging in recreational activities like exercise or sports.
Admittedly, there are reasons to suggest that the internet has provided websites that display interactive lessons and updated information, which can make learning more boisterous. However, the consensus is that children cannot learn this without teachers, who can provide a detailed discussion and reliable response, to supervise them.
To conclude, I would argue that online websites pose numerous disadvantages in their lives. It would be better if there is a parental guidance among children who are yet incognizant about the usage of internet.
Essay 680:
These days, people argue that providing the facilities for physical activity is the best option to enhance their fitness but other side claims that it has very little impact and also different point of views should be outweighed considering public health status. In this essay, I will elaborate the topic into several discussions underneath.
Nowadays, in their daily routine sedentary people is not include their working days and leisure time for physical activity. Because they tend to use all their time to focus on the important thing related to their job, family and the other. Lacking time and facilities could be the reason to alter their mood to conduct the sports session. But the condition not will be the same if several facilities are well-fulfilled in society. For example, the government can build the cheap access to a park so the people could easily reach them.
However, to focus on sports interests is not universal. Some people are already adapt their lifestyle to exercise. So, promoting sports facilities would not greatly influence their behaviour. Because to do sports activity, someone should understand how to do in proper ways.
As well as physical activity, high tax penalties could be imposed on high-fat food products, tobacco and alcohol. The reason is reliance on their daily habitual, to do so, could decrease the consumer. This obviously will lead to influences statistics level on public health.
People have different ideas and opinions regarding public health care. Some of them think that opportunities for sports activities should be promoted to increase the health status of people, whereas others are of the opinion that it is a useless method and other ways should be needed for the optimal health.
On the one hand, sports activities enhance the overall health of people as it improves blood circulation to all organs of human body and strengthens body muscles. Besides, these activities help to burn out fat and lipids considerably which is much more helpful to avoid coronary artery diseases forever. Next, mental well-being can also be achieved by doing regular sports exercises. It is proven that regular exercise keeps people fit and help them prevent many diseases.  But, in some places, the opportunities for sports activities are less and it should be encouraged owing to enormous benefits. For example, European countries provide great sports facilities for their citizens which would definitely increase productivity instead of recurrent diseases. From this regards, it the government invest on building more sports zone and parks, people would be naturally motivated to use those facilities and in the long run, the public health in a country would improve.
On the other hand, there are others who contend that sports facilities do not help public to make better health status. Therefore, diet planning, mental relaxation techniques such as yoga, meditation and prayer, moderate physical exercises and attending health education classes should be followed as the best methods to avoid health problems. But, these measures should only be supervised by expert personnel in those fields. This method would reduce body fats and cholesterol to a greater extent, especially diet planning with the guidance of a dietitian. This group of please also believe that establishing new sports facilities would have little effect on public health as very few people would use those facilities regularly. They also argue that better healthcare centres should be established and more expert doctors should be enrolled to serve people instead of spending the budget on sports centres.
By observing both sides of the argument, I think that sports facilities help prevent diseases and keep people fit. On the other hand, other methods should also be included for promoting public health. Hence the government should emphasise equally to establish sports facilities and promoting other ways of improving public health.
Essay 681:
It is believed that the invention of airplanes has changed the way people travel these days. For a number of reasons, this mode of transportation has brought positive aspects in our lives, and the following essay will discuss them in details.
Firstly, it is undeniable that with the existence of aeroplanes, people could travel to another country or continent in such a shorter time. With this advanced technology, people could save more time and be more productive. For instance, with the existence of Concorde supersonic airplanes, people could travel from London to New York in just several hours, and once they arrive at their destination point, they could do a lot of things there from sightseeing, shopping up to the business meeting.  
Secondly, airplanes have positively affected the development of tourism sectors. Nowadays, there are a lot of low-cost airlines, such as Tiger Air, Value Air, Jet Star and AirAsia which sell their tickets at affordable rates. As a result, more people are doing travel activities these days, and they boost the tourism industries. More resorts and hotels are being built in the tourist destination places and it has created a lot of job opportunities for the local people. 
In conclusion, it is a fact that airplanes play a significant role in people's live these days, as they bring a lot of benefits for many people. Some of the benefits of airplanes are that it could shorten the travelling time, therefore people could manage more of their time. And then, with the existence of airplanes, it has affected the tourism industry as it has created a lot of employment for the local people.
Essay 683:
Some people believe that boundaries between countries become less evident each year due to the rapid development of globalisation. Although this trend has some drawbacks, I would agree that the benefits of globalisation outweigh the drawbacks.
One the one hand, I believe that globalisation has many positive impacts on our life. Firstly, by globalisation business become increasingly international. Multinational companies tend to do more business across the world. So, they can produce products in some place and trade it in another. For example, McDonald's company opened many branches on every street across the world. Secondly, the globalisation offers more job opportunities to people in developing countries and encourage investment in it. By this, they fight poverty and low socioeconomic status. Finally, free trade between countries could strength the political relationships between countries and this may result in more peace and long friendship between them. Because of the free trade policy, many developing countries are now exporting goods to developed countries and that in terms of revenue generating is a huge sector. For instance, many Asian third world countries are generating their lion share of foreign currency reservation by exporting readymade garments. This has been possible only because of the globalisation.
On the other hand, globalisation is not beneficial to everyone. One problem is that globalisation could lead to increase redundancy and job loss in developed countries. Companies can move to developing countries where labour is cheap. Also, this associated with poor working and low salaries in developing countries. Another drawback is that globalisation can lead to increase waste production and pollution. This affects the human health negatively.
In conclusion, I would argue that the benefits of globalisation outweigh the negative impact. Also, there should be globalisation regulation for the salaries and the working environment and the government should impose laws to protect the environment from pollution.
Essay 685:
Firstly, a lot of people believe that music has a positive effect on human's cognitive development. Based on some scientific researches, it is found that people who love music are more intelligent than those who do not like music. They could balance their emotional and logical thinking, therefore they could easily adapt to different kind of environments.
Secondly, it is believed that music could also affect to people's performances. It is a fact that fast beat music could positively affect to athletes' performances, therefore these type of music are usually played during the training and the game session. And then it is true that slow instrument music could help people in releasing their stress, therefore they are always played in relaxation places such as in the reflexology, spa or massage centres.
Lastly, some people are relying on music as their source of income. A lot of people do not realise that music industries have created a lot of job opportunities in societies. Some people of relying themselves on music as their main jobs, such as being a singer, music producer, songwriter and last but not least as a music teacher.
In conclusion, it is true that music plays a vital role in our ways of life, as music can affect our mindset and emotions. And then music can also be used as a source of income as well, therefore, we must appreciate music and enjoy them.
Essay 686:
Music plays an important role in human life. Reasons for listening to music and time of listening to music differ from person to person according to their lifestyle. I will elucidate the different effects of music on humans with examples in the following paragraphs.
Music has the power to control the human mind. For instance, after a stressful day at work, I would like to listen to Sitar music by famous Indian musician Mr Madhavan and that would give me a quick relaxation. This is due to the fact that music waves propagate to the brain and stimulate the nerves of mind. There is one better example of a similar kind, my colleague Mr Govind likes to hear music at work by using headphones. According to his view, his brain works very sharp if he listens to music and he can finish work very quickly.  So, effects of music are fascinatingly different from person to person. In addition, there are a few more scenarios in which music is necessary.
Music is intervened in many people lives such that they could not live without it. To illustrate such as my friend Mr Raghu, deeply habituated to listening music, in such a way, without it, he could not get sleep in bed and if the music stops, he wakes up immediately. Let us take the case of my elder brother, he works as a truck driver, continuously in driving for days and drives for thousands of kilometres. So, obviously, his job is monotonous and listening to music become compulsory for him.
Essay 687:
The way in which numerous children spend their free time has changed significantly through the advent of television. This change in activity, however, has had both a positive and negative effect on these children.
Compared to past leisure activities, television has been beneficial for a child’s education and entertainment. Before the invention of television, children often listened to educational programmes on the radio. But unlike radio which is only audio, television is both audio and image. Children today not only listen to but can also watch programmes on television, such as a kindergarten teacher teaching the alphabet. The extra dimension of the image makes learning the alphabet simpler, and it is also easier to remember. Furthermore, in the past, young children often played with toys. However, many children found these toys dull and boring to play with. Young children today find television much more entertaining. They regularly watch cartoons after school. This helps them to relax and unwind.
In contrast to those benefits, television has been harmful to a child’s physical and social development. Before television, which is an indoor sedentary activity, children played outdoors more frequently. Children of modern times spend less time outdoors and tend to sit in front of the television indoors for too long. As a result of this inactivity, there is an increasing amount of unfit and overweight children in the world. In addition, previously, children spent more time talking with their friends face-to-face. Television rather is a passive activity with no direct interaction. To make matters worse children of today often watch television in isolation. Consequently, many children have fewer friends through the poor social skills they have developed.
In conclusion, television as a leisure activity for children has both benefits and drawbacks. Therefore, when children watch television, the programmes they should watch narrowing down to either educational or entertaining. However, they must balance the outdoor activities and engage with their friends.
Essay 689:
Many hold on to this view that today mankind’s way of life is surrounded by a wide range of advanced facilities and that exerts profound impacts on nature. I am of those individuals who strongly concur with this idea. In this essay, it is going to be assessed some effects resulting from modern lifestyle.
As the main issue which could stem from developing urban life is that the communities increase the utilisation of natural resources ranging from oil and gas to forests and water, to improve social facilities in the mega cities. By the way of illustration, some governments devise the plans to ascend the urban areas by deforestation projects. The second considerable plight is the fact that the technologic equipment cause widespread environmental pollution all around the world, which undoubtedly, the health of human being could be brought about those pollutions. For example, in some big cities of the world, the air pollution caused by automobile's exhaust has been turned to the serious crisis.
As the third stumbling block of the advanced way of life, it could be noticed that people have got used to spending their time working with novel devices ranging from computers to smartphones and also video games. The side effect of such habits could negatively affect the families` relationships. As a result, the member of families, especially the youngsters would feel lonely even if they live together.
In conclusion, by all the reasons mentioned above, it undeniably seems that despite a variety of merits of developed lifestyle, human being suffers the difficulties organised from the modern changes. However, the adequate and integrated management could conduct the mankind to make the earth to a better place to live.
Essay 690:
Many people believe that as the human standard of living gets better, it will have a negative effect on the environment. To a certain point, I would agree with the statement, but it really depends on the method that we choose to improve our lifestyle.
It is a fact that some people choose to focus on improving the standard of living without any concern of their surrounding environment. As a consequence, many natural areas have been damaged and caused the extinction of some species. Moreover, cars, refrigerators, air-conditioners, room-heathers etc have improved the way we live our life on one hand and also caused environmental degradation on the other hand. Industrialisation, factories, large offices, luxury apartments, air travel etc are all part of our improved lifestyle but yet they have many negative consequences to our environment.
On the other hand, the public could not generalise a statement that says "the improvement of the living standard will have a negative effect on the environment". It really depends on how the government of each country handle it, as some countries are proven that they could manage both aspects simultaneously. For instance, Canada is known as one of the advanced countries in the world, whereas the living standard of its people is better than many other countries. And the government keep on developing methods, policies and procedures to improve the people's living standard. However, Canada is also known as one of the greenest countries in the world, as the government is also concern about preserving the originality and biodiversity of its nature.
In conclusion, to a certain extent, I would agree that the improvement of the living standard has affected negatively to the environment. But it happens in some countries, whereas the governments have weak and unmeasured regulations. There are some countries who could manage between improving the living standard and maintaining the environment, and their way of governing should be reviewed and followed by other countries to make the world a better place.
Essay 692:
Technology makes life easy and viable. Gone are the days when people used to use jumbo style instruments to say, hear, view and watch. With the growing changes in technology, one can be tracked with his identity and actions known.
In earlier days when people were contacted using telephones, faxes and telegrams. They used to be at one place and their whereabouts were tracked by the phone they respond. If we consider the recent trends in the technology; it has become feasible and transparent, the mobile phones which are used nowadays are backed up by a network which will be connected with the user of the phone.
Their connectivity to the network provides access to a person’s mobility and actions, with the usage of mobile phone a person can be tracked and his whereabouts can be known. When we consider the security cameras; cameras installed at certain places provide the information regarding the mobility of persons, the cameras installed at various places not only helps in monitoring the traffic surveillance but also help in nabbing the culprits.
If we consider the advantages of these technological developments they are beneficial in averting certain dangerous incidents, definitely the advantages of technology being used in tracking and identifying the suspicious activities are at par. For instance; the security cameras installed in different busy areas survey the movement of suspicious persons and with the help of these footages major calamities/dangerous situations can be averted. The conversation between persons if tapped will certainly help in identifying suspicious activities and saving the aftermath consequences which are danger in nature.
As stated above, the use of technology certainly helps but this technology even steals privacy of people without their knowledge, for instance, the security cameras installed in a shopping complex or restaurant monitor the activities regularly without the knowledge of the people/visitors and this is being used improperly. Even the private conversations between people are tapped and are used for illegal means to gain some undue advantage. Certainly, the advantages outweigh the disadvantages but if the disadvantages are monitored and if the technology is practised ethically .The use of technology in monitoring and tracking certainly helps the peace and harmony of a state and country.
Technology has advanced beyond the basic needs of people and nowadays offers devices that can be used to track activities of people through mobile phones, CCTV cameras etc. Although the main idea behind making such devices is to ensure safety of the people and avert criminal acts, however, many incidents has been reported where in these devices was used to record activities of people without their knowledge. At the same time, as I would like to think, such misuse of technology in present times cannot still override the benefits derived from it.
It is true that the number of cases reported on use of devices for infringement into people private without their consent has increased in the past few years. In reality, all such cases are due to wrong minds of the people who believe in exploiting others and won't hesitate to use any means to achieve their purpose. Such people can harm others even without the use of technology.
Despite the disadvantageous use of technology by unreliable people, it cannot be denied that development of device for the use of monitoring people exercises has proved enormously beneficial in reducing cost spend on the guaranteeing security of individuals at public places , offices and remote areas. This spared measure of cash can further be utilized on other welfare prospects of individuals. . Additionally, with the utilization these gadget, the crime rate has reduced and it's easy of find the real culprit behind the crime. Besides, tracking through mobile phones made it difficult to abscond for the guilty.
Essay 693:
In recent days, there has been a significant increase in the number of overweight people and it has become a deadly disorder for people. The rising number of obesity reverses with the decreasing of healthy life and sports exercises in daily life. I personally assert that it is caused by having a bad eating habit and lack of time in relaxing body or doing exercises. This essay will elaborate ideas more with some solutions.
People mostly spend their time in office dealing with so many workloads thus they have no time to go to a gym in order to keep fit their body. They begin the day since early morning until the midnight to run out with a variety of their projects. Therefore, the best solution to encounter this problem is by providing fitness centre in the work office that is accessible for every employee to do sports activities during the break time. Consequently, employees can keep their body fit.
Another reason is having bad diet in which people prefer to eat junk food instead of the healthy food. It is hard for them to prepare their own meal while the deadline of work is waiting, thus an instant food remains as their choice. Even though they already know that fast food can deteriorate their health, but they keep on consuming as their meals. To tackle this problem, the employer must provide a cafeteria which serves much more nutrition foods accessed by each employee.
Essay 694:
Over the past few years, advancement in technology has made human life easy and more comfortable; however, it has made some detrimental impact on people's life such as they tend to eat unhealthy food and do little workouts.  In this essay, I will find out its reasons and try to draw some solutions to minimise its negative impacts on human's life.
To begin with, the main reason for people's unhealthy lifestyle is too much workload in the office. This means they have to work for extra hours in the office and so they cannot spare enough time to make food for themselves at home; eventually, inadvertently they opt for fast food or other readymade package food for them because they are ready to make and tasty despite unhealthy. Another compelling reason is technological advancement which affects greatly to human's life. For example, a few years ago people tend to walk some distance to reach their office when they commute to their workplace and now almost everyone has a car and they do not have to walk. Additionally, home appliances such as advanced dishwasher, microwave oven, and so on have made physical work for a man unlike some years ago. Hence, their passive form of exercises has been increasingly reduced.
There are few solutions to mitigate the situation. Firstly, individuals should be made known via health awareness programs by the government about benefits of healthy diet and the detrimental effect of junk food and ready-made package food. Moreover, the authority ought to emphasise on building more gyms at a nominal fee in each city so that more people take benefit of them. Secondly, the government should mandate physical education starting from the primary education and they should be graded with their examination with sports performance along with their academic so that pupils encouraged about their health from their childhood. Finally, the government should enforce stringent employment laws that help people to reduce their overtime work and make their work life balance.
In Conclusion, people living unhealthy lifestyle owing to extra workload given by their employers and advances in technology. However, to kerb this situation, the government come forward for the society by providing education and awareness.
Essay 695:
School education is an important part of every individual’s life. It does create a base for everything else in the life ahead, in fact, whole learning capabilities depend on this. Some people opine that schools should prepare students for the university rather than jobs. However, I do assent with this opinion to a large extent.
Opponents may argue that preparing for workplace right from school days can be beneficial for survival in today’s world of cut-throat competition. But, I would say is that it is too early stage to engage the little buds with some job oriented activities. They should be rather be occupied with learning the basics of various subjects or languages, which can assist them in further studies during the high school education. Take an example, learning alphabets then words and then sentences in school have a purpose behind this sequence. They curriculum have been designed the way it will be easy to grasp for students. 
In addition to that, the fundamentals learnt at the school time succour the pupils to decide about the subjects or field they will like to pursue in universities and life ahead. At the school time, students are not capable enough to decide on what they want to do in their life in future, so it is hard to help them learn the particular skills that will be required. For example, different fields require different prowess like defence forces demand more discipline while government positions require more patience which can only be learnt later on after completing education.
Essay 696:
Life expectancy has soared nowadays which means that people are living for more years than before, and credit for this surely goes to the advanced health care facilities available in the contemporary world.
Yes, most people view it as an advantageous development, as we can expect our dear ones to be with us for more time. As only after retirement one usually gets much time to spend with oneself and family. Therefore, one has more years to rejoice what life has to offer. Moreover, old people in the organisations are the most knowledgeable people, who can help and guide the young employees to acquire proficiency in various skills. Take an example of a senior database administrator, who can only offer valuable information to the trainees who have just joined the company.
On the contrary, this also has some subtle disadvantages. Not everyone is healthy enough to enjoy old age gracefully. Sometimes one gets so weak that he/she feels difficult to carry out even mundane tasks. But they have no other option than just passing their days somehow. Apart from that, governments are now burdened with providing old age provisions to more number of people than the past. Ultimately, it forces young people in the workforce to pay more taxes, to generate more money for these additional expenditures of management of the country. Being old and dependent is something which is increasing recently due to the increased life span.
Essay 697:
Education is surely one of the most crucial sectors of every nation. The prosperity of a country is directly proportional to the number of educated citizens. I assent to this affirmation to a great extent.
Opponents may opine that the skills are necessary for developments, not the education as many of the famous personalities of the world like Albert Einstein, Thomas Edison, and Bill gates were among school and college dropouts. They brought big revolutions in their respective fields without any formal education.
However, I would say that ratio of such people is very low. Therefore, we cannot underestimate the power of formal education. As it has become one of the mandatory conditions for even job applicants. Take an example MNCs engaged in software production, they are more likely to employ candidates who are degree holders rather than those who have the required skill but no evidence of their skills in terms of education.  Thus, firms only believe in educated youth to contribute in productive ways to the prosperity of their nation. Education is the basic needs for a skilled person and it is very unlike that without proper education a skilled generation would automatically build. There is a huge difference between an electric engineer who has a Masters degree from a reputed university and an electric technician who works in a shop. The former one is the type of people a nation needs for development while the later one helps people to complete their electric connections and repairing.
Moreover, it has been observed that developed countries have a high literacy rate than the developing and under developed nations. This clearly bears the testimony of the fact that education is the reason behind their progress. So, educated populaces do affect the flourishing capabilities of the country .Therefore, it should be taken care of.
Essay 698:
At recent years, the vast growth of technology relating to the internet, social media, etc. leads us to learn English easily because the contents are always useful for self-learning at home. However, teacher and class study are found to be beneficial in some ways to maximise the result of learning English. Throughout this essay, an intermediate position can be taken through some considerations given underneath.
I believe, self-motivated learning can be more productive by setting goals, the manners in the study process, and the time management. By self-prompting, students or learners can put themselves to the high level of learning by printing modules, looking for needed recordings, collecting movies and watching them, downloading and listening to certain songs, or even doing some chats online with mates living in Western countries. As a result, students can do several things that are urgent to improve several skills which are lack independently and ignore few unnecessary things not to be done.
However, as human being commonly, most of the people seem to be inconsistent to deal with individual learning. They need accompanies from teachers and classmates not only to enrich knowledge in class progress but also to gain established goals together. By working for tasks, assignments, and presentations students will not have much free time to conduct wasteful activities motivation to attempt self-study hardly.
It is a truth that most people feel convenient to learn in silent, but comfort, in some ways, causes laziness and as a result, people cannot accomplish the English learning. That is why teachers are always needed to be involved.
To sum up, I believe that both ways of learning have benefits and drawbacks, therefore, combining them together, without superiority one over another, will be extraordinary relevant to learn English effectively.
Essay 699:
Today it is quite common to see sporting events, teams and even individual players wearing logos on uniforms and appear in television advertising, which means commercialization has become a part of the modern game, with both positive and negative outcomes.  
Advocates of sports sponsorship believe that commercialization enables players financially secured and maintains professional sports to be of high quality and great entertainment. If a major company sponsors an event, it is much more likely to get prime time television coverage, which means bringing in greater advertising revenues and exposing more people to the sport. This will bring in more fans, improve the profitability of local sports clubs, which in turn helps the local economy and revives community spirit when the team is performing well.  
However, others claim that this has had some negative impacts as  commercialization has changed the attitude of the players and jeopardised the true spirit of the game. The players no more play for the thrill and love of the game but have been lured and entangled into the vicious web of match fixing. They have become commodities to be traded and sold for extravagant sums of money and even clubs are being sold to the highest bidders. This has hampered and defamed the spirit of the game.
In my opinion, though there are scandals about players using performance-enhancing drugs, which should be discouraged ,these situations are under control. And it is not necessarily wrong for companies to sponsor sports with extraordinary prize money, which not only helps to promote players’ skills and ensure their livelihood but also creates high-quality sports events that generate economic growth as well as encourage people to get more exercise to keep healthy. 
Essay 700:
In modern hypercompetitive labour force environment, employers are seeking for candidates with high capabilities to develop their companies, and under this circumstance, people with strong interpersonal skills are tending to be more favourable. However, good qualification still matters and it is also an indispensable factor.
Traditionally, once an individual acquires a good qualification, he or she is most likely to get a stable and high paid job, however, this kind of standard is gradually no longer able to catch up the society with a high developing pace. Personal and social skills, such as being able to communicate and exercise self-control as well as being multi-functional and having the correct level of self-esteem, are becoming more important in determining earnings and job promotions. Because in today’s highly shifting economy, even capable people are less prone to work as individuals, they tend to beat their competitors as a team, which means individuals must smoothly cooperate with each other.
However, good qualifications still matter and it has already been found that a top university degree is still more attractive than a normal one in the labour force market. This means good qualifications should be harnessed to build a stronger team to battle in the modern changing structure of business. A world-class group, for example, cannot have a lack of people with high qualifications as well, without them, it is less likely to build a firm foundation to compete with their rivals.  
As a whole, it is true that lacking certain qualification may be a drawback for an individual. However, I believe this weakness can be easily made up by one’s excellent social skills as long as he is very good at motivating team members and uniting others’ strength to fulfil targets.
Essay 701:
Zoos have been amusing and educating humans about animals for centuries. Although, containment of animals in zoos is an increasingly controversial topic. Some argue that confining animals to their cages in zoos are both necessary and healthy, while others refute this. Both sides of this debate will be analysed in this essay before a reasoned conclusion is drawn.
On one hand, many believe that keeping animals inside the contrived environment of a zoo is a way to save many species from going extinct. For example, the Auckland Zoo has many breeding programs in place to enable animals to mate and reproduce. These animals might not be able to find mating partners in the wild and hence their species could be wiped out. This example makes it clear why many people support this stance.
On the contrary, many argue that the practice of keeping animals in a zoo is harmful to these primates. For instance, a recent survey found out that animals in the zoo in Karachi, Pakistan, were fed toxic substances by the visitors which had an adverse effect on the health of many animals. As this example illustrates, animals in zoos can be abused if proper safety measures are not employed. Hence, it is obvious why this point of view has garnered support.
After looking at both sides of this argument, it is felt that keeping animals in zoos begets greater benefits than disadvantages as long as there are precautionary measures in place to ensure the safety of these animals. It is hoped that zoos will continue to keep endangered species from going extinct.
Nothing is more barbaric than destroying the peace of someone's livelihood, poaching them and destroying their natural habitats. Humans from a very ancient time had close coordination with animals and other living creatures. They have been using them as pets, for cultivation and moreover, as food in many sorts. Thus, keeping animals in zoos can be considered both negative and positive considering a various perspective of the situations.
Regarding the positive sides, climate change, like the wildfires and intensive cold weather, is causing disastrous effects in the lives of animals at an enormous rate. Millions of species are dead and many are in danger, and rescuing those species of endangered animals from such calamitous situations can be done with the help of an artificial ecosystem like the zoo. Moreover, zoos can be the place for researches and considered to be an area where our young generations could enjoy and learn about various rare species.
On the contrary, considering the confinement and artificial ecosystem that animals have to adjust within a zoo, it is often discarded by the environmentalist as an unsafe place for animals and birds. Zoos often are just the place where men could see the animals and enjoy while small iron cages are applied to enclose the otherwise free animals and birds. Moreover, the authority often tries to cash out the animals and entertain the visitors which is cruel.
Taking a look at the real purpose of the existence of zoo and various benefits that have been delivered to the animal kingdom, along with understanding the negative effects of zoos, it can be stated that zoos can sometimes be seen as required but, it is a rather bad alternative to a natural environment.
Essay 702:
The nature of education is to humanise human, stated by Paolo Pereira. Some people believe that humanising human means that every person should be beneficial for society on how societies get the advantages from their knowledge and skills. However, others believe that they attend the education institutions for having skills and experience as the tools to enter job market easily. This essay aims to discuss both purposes as well as provide several reasons.
People tend to focus on developing their social awareness through education in order to bring the society become a better community. They believe that the ultimate aim of education is that to contribute as well as to implement the knowledge and skills for the prosperity of society. For example, those who are expertise in agriculture science probably educate the farmers how to have a good quality of plants, how to manage the irrigation system well and how to conduct the product sales in the market. Moreover, graduates are believed as the social agents who bridge the society and government in terms of making society based policy. If there is a controversial policy that harms people, educated persons are probably asked by those people to help them conducting negotiation even against the policy.
On the other hand, some believe that the ultimate aim of having an education is that people tend to get certain skills and experience as the main tools to achieve a good position in the job market. The company might require well-educated workers and put them in a strategic position which brings them to such more prosperous economic life condition. It is undeniable to stop people making education as the way to gain personal purpose because it is their personal rights. In addition, government guarantees every single person to have education for whatever the purpose as long as it is still on the education rules.
I believe that both purposes of people in entering education institution discussed above might be in line together. We can be valuable persons for the society while having a job which we allocate some money from our salaries to educate people by providing the fund for those children who need it for school fee. The higher salary we achieve, the more money we can donor.
In short, everyone has their own targets to entering schools, universities or colleges. The most important thing is how to save ourselves by having a permanent job while contributing ours kills for the prosperity of society.
In current years, the aim of pursuing higher education has been widely a fashionable trend. Some people believe that education lays on the aim of preparing individuals to serve the society. While some others assert that education conducts personal goal. Indeed, these issues emerges a fierce debate. As regards for this case, I will scrutinise both views along with related examples.
To begin with, the idea that every living individual belongs to the more complex group is a very basic concept which shapes any aspect of human life including education. This further becomes a framework of education nurturing people in the sake of emerging positive impact to the broad communities. In this regards, as a part of the society, individuals are responsible for contributing their knowledge they have acquired. Subsequently, it is strongly assumed that knowledge without devotion is such a meaningless sense in any variant of ways. It is the sense of devotion which encourage individuals to achieve their education for the sake of benefiting others. Furthermore, the national government urges the schools to enrich the pupils with the sense of nationalism where the citizen has to put public necessity over personal need. A very good example is Indonesian Government requires schools to provide nationality subject in elementary and junior high schools.
In contrast, obtaining individual ambition should remain as the purpose of education particularly in the modern age. As is it widely acknowledged that individualism becomes a major trend where people put aside social aspect. Undoubtedly, modern lifestyle propels people to seek their own desire of how their education should be aimed to. Moreover, the belief that people must fulfil their own need plays an essential role in this case. Finally, human rights tell us the freedom of everyone choice in focusing their own passion. For instance, people has legal rights to assert their purpose in acquiring education.
Essay 703:
Perhaps no subject around the world causes as much controversy as education does. There has long been a positive attitude towards using computers at schools, nowadays. While there are persuasive arguments in favour of boosting teachers' wages, I would argue that computers are much more necessary.
On the one hand, it is suggested that teachers play a vital role in education and society as a whole. To begin with, providing teachers with high wages is a top priority in schooling systems. Since they are paid well, they motivate to transfer lessons to students with a considerable amount of energy. Besides, what is quite indispensable in schools is the presence of teachers so as to having mutual interaction between them and students which leads to students' success. It is obvious that if teachers find their salary as high as possible, they will be more likely to enjoy teaching.
On the other hand, I advocate the role of computers in education. Firstly, we are living in a modern world and due to this students need to be familiar with the benefits of using computers as a means of study. Thus it is worthwhile that budget is allocated to purchase them. These devices facilitate the way pupils learn their materials. In addition, from a psychological perspective, recently youngsters are unwilling to attend school. Therefore, the widespread use of the computers can act as a driving force to create pleasant school atmosphere.
In conclusion, although teachers with a high salary are considered to be highly beneficial for the educational system, I believe that financial support for providing computers has far advantages. They alter the way knowledge are transferred and provide gratitude for pupils. 
Essay 705:
It is true that students these days have to study many subjects compared to the past. At times it seems that there is no need to study subjects in which a child is not interested in but this lead to long term effects on the career of a student.
To begin with, for the all-round development of a child basic knowledge of every subject is quite essential because being aware of only a few interested subjects will create certain problems in future. For instance, if we consider a student, who is allowed to learn only his/her interested subject then he/she cannot cope in other fields due to lack of information. To develop a perfect society, people with complete understanding are required then only they can handle the issue in adverse situations.
Moreover, each and every subject has its own importance, we cannot deny this fact. Learning all the subjects from school days onwards will provide a student with more career opportunities. As we know the taste of a person changes as he/she grows up. Therefore if he/she is given a chance to select the interested subjects then sometimes it happens that he/ she can lose that interest after a certain age. This would lead to distress for a student.
However, learning a few specific subjects have some benefits too. First, a student can develop a complete in-depth knowledge on certain subjects which helps them to work effectively in future when they start to do a job. In addition to this dealing with only a few subjects make a student stress free and keep him/her away from the burden of academic vast syllabus thus he/she can concentrate well in studies.
Essay 706:
In today's contemporary world, it has become a reverent activity of fetching a job or to fly overseas to be acquainted with the essential life skills before getting started with their higher education. Indeed, in this case, the students are deliberately let into a situation where in every time they are intrigued with the most required aspects for facing the real world through their experience. However, in another case, they are highly likely to get diverted from a regular study routine and take up a different path which is not careered prospective.
Close examination shows that there are a variety of causes for this study break. Primary reason why students are driven towards work or travel abroad is that they are highly motivated to broaden their horizons. This is because they want themselves to be either equipped to handle challenging issues of  work environment like accomplishing tasks in spite of deadlines and poignant pressures or to explore  various cultures and people for the betterment of their future. Perhaps as significant as this is the fact that socialising with others has been a major life turning point. For instance, both while working and studying abroad, the persons influencing at that time may act as torch bearers by rendering helping hands not only by giving reference letter but also by showing the career path. This naturally leads them to be more distinctive when revealing their talents in the university.
On the flip side, nevertheless, there is an upraised probability for a novice to get deviated from the strict timely bound studies and course path. There are two main reasons why this break in the studies deters educational progress. Perhaps the most significant of these is that they are entirely packed up with a different mundane and less likely get concentrated in studying further. Another connected reason is that the high pay, which they get on imprints of joyful moments about their travel, makes them less capable of analysing the prospects of getting further educated. This is because they have been earning money or handling more money during the course of breaks. In this way, even if they appear in the university, they are less likely to progress without being imbibed with the value of education.
In a nutshell, though the study off seems to be beneficial by increasing the pragmatic cognizance of students, an insight to this scenario brings out the negative sides like distractions as well. So, to be honest, it depends on students to make maximum use of their acquaintance during the course of break and pursue a highly rewarding course.
Essay 707:
The biggest challenge that human beings face in this world is the global warming. This problem has been a concern of most scientists around the world since the temperature of the earth was seen having an increase which means that there is an unbalance in the earth air compositions. Animal husbandry is being judged as the biggest contributor to this issue due to the methane exhausted by ruminants. However, this, in my perspective, is not the truth but just a result of political necessity.
Animal husbandry cannot be blamed as the biggest cause of global warming owing to some reasons. First of all, human beings cannot deny their requirements of essential proteins which are mostly obtained from animals such as cattle, goats, chickens, etc. Currently, beef, a product from cattle which is one type of ruminants, has been fulfilling the proteins demand worldwide because it is one of the most productive and reproductive animals with a quite short interval calving (being able to produce one calf per cow per year and achieving a slaughtering age of three to four years). Secondly, the methane produced by the animals is actually harmful to the world when the number of plants decreases dramatically and not be taken into account as a serious problem. It should be more trees planted and more reforestations done to balance the production of animals. Therefore, the collaboration between all sectors of agriculture is genuinely needed.
On the other hand, numerous other factors are also considerably leading to an increasing amount of greenhouse gases such as Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. These are, for example, industries using petrol gases and an increasing number of fuel-based vehicles, which required by the need for the expanding human population around the globe.
However, this is not as easy as it is thought. The more research is required to be conducted in order to measure to what extent this globe has experienced this frustrating problem and of course, how much the methane from animal husbandry contributed invites a more meticulous study to not casually conclude that it is the most horrible haunting factor.
All in all, to stop the rise in greenhouse gases, an appropriate number of measures should be conducted. There is no need to just blame one crucial suspicious contributive sector without any actions.
Essay 708:
The globalisation era nowadays is changing children habit to compare with the previous era in the aspect of eating habit and lifestyle. Some people believe that the eating habit and lifestyle have negative effects on children's life especially their health and poor friendship. In my opinion, it is a fact that children eating habit and lifestyle have changed dramatically that has dangerous influences. The drawback of it will be presenting on this paper.
First of all, eating habit will affect the children health. It is important to notice that the current children commonly find out the easiest and the fastest way to find the food. Many ways to acquire the food but one better and faster way is fast food or junk food, which is provided in every corner of a city such as hamburger, pizza, etc. It is important to become aware of that this kind of food is not containing nutrition. Meanwhile, in the young ages are better to consume nutrition food which useful for their brain. The drawback of eating fast food is getting obesity, which is becoming common illness of young people nowadays. 
Moreover, children lifestyle also leads to lack of socialising with other people. More and more children nowadays spend time playing computer games in their bedroom which have beneficial outcomes to train their mind. In contrast, this habit has many disadvantages, for example, becoming addicted which lead to the lack of contact with their friends and also get sick because they never do exercises. Furthermore, the children should be able to manage time wisely between playing computer games and socialising with other people.
In conclusion, it should be put in our attention that children activities nowadays are different to several years ago. Most today children’s habits are eating and playing computer games which affect their health, for example, obesity. The parents are responsible for helping their children to prevent them from any kinds of illness.
Essay 710:
There are modern investigations that have asserted that various forms of media such as World Wide Web and television have enormously affected individual’s perspectives. Although some might believe that government officials are more influential being in the society, it can be argued that broadcasted information in media generates bigger impact on their decisions.
Primarily, government officials are those people who are more affluent and authoritative. They have wealth and power to manipulate people’s actions. There are some cases that people have been promised that the government will bring changes to the status of a country. Furthermore, elite lawmakers were also the one who propose legislations, which creates overall control of a society. As a result, citizens have left any choices but to oblige to the law.
In contrast, there are also justifications that state that mass media has a higher influential contribution to the public. Firstly, the scope of information in multifarious forms of media is presumably broad. The information such as news, knowledge and updates are delivered instantly at people’s convenience. Secondly, these days, celebrities are now being used by media to advertise products, which are negligible among the crowd. Some arguments suggest that these successful people have the higher chance of persuasion because they are often being shown in various forms of media.
In my opinion, I assert that mass media have changed people’s actions because of the diverse range of information it has. Indubitably, government officials have the prerogatives to undermine people because they hold the privilege to introduce legislations. However, some justifications state that people’s democratic rights can contradict the verdicts of the government in a form of appeal or revolution.
To conclude, the influence of government leaders in a country is undeniable because of monetary advantages and bestowed powers, but the scope of messages in media and the collaboration of celebrities have a strong impact on people's lives.
Essay 712:
Increased in flights has brought significant disadvantages in the earth's ecosystem. Although some people believe that mode of transport should be prohibited in the society, it can be argued that there are considerable benefits of retaining the number of flights.
Primarily, there are limited numbers of transportation to travel to overseas destinations and one of which is the aeroplane. In the past, primitive people travelled through ships or boats, yet it used to take them a very long time to reach other nations. It is widely believed that travelling at the wind is the expeditious means of reaching different countries at the desired time, and through aeroplanes, time will not be a problem for those people who have business meetings and personal appointments. Furthermore, it is often said that because of convenience in transportation, it is most likely that globalisation will be established in the entire countries. For instance, some foreign investors can launch their business in a country that has cheap labour and market goods, thus it will develop the nexus of trade and industry.
In addition, if air transport is banned some countries, it would be a hindrance for those people to experience the leisure in other countries with rewarding amenities. To illustrate, there are many people who want to experience the luxury in abroad, and it would cost them too much time if they opt to a sea-based journey.
Admittedly, air based travel has become a culprit towards widespread of much fumes which contribute to global warming, yet there are justifications that believe that there are also other sources of pollution, such as CFC producing appliances, fossil fuel reliant vehicles and methods of waste disposal. Thus, aeroplanes should not be blamed for the deterioration of the environment.
Essay 713:
The beauty of the cinema to show films on a wide screen with good sound quality has amused people for centuries. Some critics argue that enthusiasm of people going to the silver screen is fading with time and might ultimately arrive at an end someday. I agree with the critics and feel that with advancements in technology, the trend of watching films in cinema may pass on soon.
Recent headways in Technology has provided enormous choices to humans to invest time in like high technology smartphone, LED HD display TV,  Home theatre, Video games with excellent graphics and so on. Such humongous possibilities for entertainment have left little time to people to spend on watching movies at the cinema. Not just this, easily available and inexpensive DVD's and movie on the internet facilitates watching a movie anywhere, anytime and any number of times. With more and more such options heading up, the urge to watch a motion picture at the theatre has gone down further.
Nevertheless, with advancements in technology, the cinema has evolved so much that almost all the action movies and animated films are shown with high-class 3D effects and clear sound quality to maintain the craze of people in watching the movie at theatres. Further, to draw more and more audiences, cinemas are giving discount offers on movie nowadays.  But still, the people visiting cinema are fewer in number as compared to earlier times.
To sum up, with catching trends in technology, people are favouring electronic gadgets and DVD's more over cinema movies. Despite so many endeavours by the cinema owners to attract audiences, the numbers of people watching movies at the cinema are decreasing with time and may fade out soon.
In today’s modern world, watching movies has become one of the leisure activities for most people. However, there are a handful of people who assert that people will soon spend less time watching movies in the cinema which I disagree with.
There are several factors why I do not think cinema will soon become an abundant place to visit in the near future. To begin, people in the twenty-first century prefer to go to cinema due to the reason that they want to spend their precious time with their family or friends so as to strengthen their relationships. It is one of the ways that people these days, especially the teenagers use to socialise with others. By watching a movie with friends in a cinema, they can exchange their thoughts and give comments about the movie that they watched with their friends which indirectly opening up an avenue for them to understand their peers better.  As a consequence, it is not uncommon to see most of the youngsters actually plan to go to a cinema during their gatherings nowadays.
Furthermore, although there are numerous ways to download movies from the internet following the development of technology, most people still choose to go to the cinema because the sound equipment in cinema is more advanced. They like to immerse themselves in the movie as they think the story plot will be more thrilling and it can only be experienced in the cinema which is surrounded by excellent sound effects. According to the result of a recent research conducted in Columbia, most people find watching movies at home is rather boring and is not as interesting as in cinema. Thus, I believe there will not be fewer people to visit the theatre in the near future.
In conclusion, I am not convinced by the argument that people will ultimately lose interest in going to the cinema as there is evidence which shows that there is an increasing trend in the number of visitors to the cinema. I believe that cinema will not be faded out, in return, it will continue to flourish in the decades to come.
Essay 714:
Many believe that multiplex & cinema is on dying spree and eventually, the cinema will die his own death, due to shift in Technology, which has literally bring cinema at Home. I am sort of in opinion that, actual movie lovers will never forget big screen. May, the number will be on downward trend and in the business context, it will not be as profitable as in last few decades.
Still, the charm of cinema is never going to die. As an individual, I always love to watch movies on the silver screen, the reason being is, fill joy of a movie can only be possible with theatre, no one is there to disturb & you can uninterruptedly enjoy or feel the story line. One always rates a movie better if he has seen it on a big screen.
However,  another aspect is also somewhat true that cinema a is on the decline. Innovation and upscaling in Technology are the prime reasons, which make people think that the era of Silver Screen is bound to die. Technology has brought the big screen at home with better sound systems, big LED screens & most importantly the ease of watching at the comfort of home.
On a high note for the big screen, the best part is, no one can watch latest flicks at home & this will make sure that people keep coming to the big screen for watching the latest work of their favourite stars.
Essay 715:
People have argued about the function of video games. A group of people believe that these digital games are beneficial for mankind, but others think that they would be a distraction to human's mind. Although video games have some positive sides, I personally believe that they have more negative effects on our minds, and the following essay will discuss them in details.
For a number of reasons, a lot of people believe that video games are entertaining and educative. It is believed that video games could help people in releasing their stress. Players could feel the excitement of being a heroic character or a professional athlete, without having the risk of being injured or hurt. And then, there are some video games which are considered as educative as well, as they are created to trigger people's imaginative thinking, such as Tetris or chess.
Despite the positive side, people do not realise that the games have become a serious problem for individuals and societies. Firstly, many people got addicted to video games, and it has affected to their work or study performance. Many workers are losing their focus and productivities, and some students have poor performance on their studies due to spending a number of hours in playing video games. Secondly, some games have shown violence and sadistic scenes and affected to the gamers' mind. There have been several cases in America, whereas students have done violence acts to their classmates because they were influenced by the game. And lastly, video games have affected to residents' health condition as well. People who play video games have the tendency to consume light snacks and do less exercise. Consequently, they have a risk of getting obesity and diabetic problems.
Essay 716:
Free tertiary education has always sparks heated debates all over the world. I, personally, completely disagree that higher education cost should be born by students because that would prevent the waste of talent resource and also it is a form investment for the government in the long run.
When higher education comes with a cost, it creates an inefficient allocation of the human resource. This is because when there is a financial constraint, some students from the less privileged background are forced to choose the courses that either is not too costly or have good employability prospects and not necessarily courses that the students want most or are best at. As a result, for example, instead of being an excellent artist, the student can only be a mediocre accountant because he cannot utilise all his potential in his chosen field, causing a waste of talent; free higher education can prevent this problem.
The second reason why tertiary education should be free is because if the government chooses not to spend money on free education, they will see rising expenditures in other areas. For example, a less educated workforce bears a higher risk of unemployment in the economic downturn, and thus the government’s coffers for unemployment aid would need to increase. Furthermore, unskilled labour earns much less than college-educated people do, and thus they contribute less income tax i.e. less revenue for the government. Not to mention, the highly skilled population is essential to any country’s economic growth in the long run.
In conclusion, because free education allows students to learn what they enjoy most and are best at, it can ensure better allocation of the human resource. Furthermore, free education can reduce unemployment cost in the economic downturn, increase government’s tax revenue, and increase economic growth in the long run. Thus, I completely disagree that students should pay for their higher education.
Essay 717:
Education is a possession which makes a person stand tall and high. It adds to the overall physical personality of the person and makes him stand apart and outshines others who don’t possess it. Education is an eternal rock which never withers, not even during the wild waves of evil. It is only education which makes people bow in front of the educated and is one of the moral fabrics of any country which binds the whole society into one nation.
There are, however, two schools of thought. One school of thought is of the view that the cost of higher studies should be borne by the students themselves. However, in such a scenario, all those meritorious students who are unable to continue their education for want of money (read economic resources) would be left with no option but to get themselves tagged as ‘drop outs’ by the society, due to no fault of theirs. ‘No student should be left deprived of education’ must be one of the objectives (read fundamental duty) of every Nation/State.
On the other hand, a student who thrives for education must be wholeheartedly supported by the Nation/State. No stone must be left unturned to make available the most precious of the stones, i.e. the education, to the student. It is so because education is something which is dearer than the fine opals, more precious than emeralds!
There’ve been quite a lot instances in the recent past, and even now, wherein the entire cost of higher studies of a student is sponsored by the State. The recent example which supports this is the educational sponsorship which was provided by the state government of ABC (a country) to the son of a widower who earns her livelihood by cleaning utensils at a roadside restaurant.
It can thus be candidly concluded that education does elevate the horizon and encourages the mankind to labour at present for accruing enjoyment at a later stage in life. Consequently, the state must take responsibility, to a certain extent and for a certain set of individuals based on economic criteria to provide them with free higher education opportunities. This, in return, would only help the State/Nation to become independent and economically stable.
Essay 718:
It is undeniable that news media has been an indispensable part of our life, displaying a much colourful world in front of us than ever before. Thanks to the development of the news media technology and the profession of journalists, we no longer feel unfamiliar about the other side of the planet.
While enjoying the wide knowledge brought by the reporters, we should also take this news with a pinch of salt as some information seems to be enticing but may not be based on the truth of the fact. As we all know, most news companies run to make profits, which is likely to make some journalists distort their reports to earn ratings. Meanwhile, many news media are controlled by some powerful institutes including the government, which would cause the journalists reporting tendentious news for they want to be in favour of the government rather than the public.
Spreading knowledge of the world for the public but not propagandising for a certain powerful organisation is the main quality a journalist should have. He should at least possess the following qualities: First of all, he should be unbiased and not easily swayed by any party or group, reporting the news as factual as it is. Second, journalists need to report news of such various fields of society, science, geology, medicine, entertainment etc.; it would be tough for him to handle this job well if he is not versatile. Also, the most important personality of a journalist is that he must be brave and bold enough because there must be tough barriers waiting for him to break down.
Essay 719:
The widening gap between the rich and the poor seems to be an increasingly bigger threat that the worldwide nations are facing in recent decades. And I think individuals, governments and powerful companies are all responsible for this.
One of the primary causes of the accelerated growth of economic inequality is due to modern technological progress. In order to create the largest wealth by costing the least, employers are motivated to increasingly concentrate on non-human factors of production, including super-automation, robotics, digital computerised operations, machines, tools, etc., which to a large degree reduces the rate of labour employment as well payment.
However, considering the fact that technology development will never cease to march forward, it brings about another vital factor - education and qualified working skills. Except for a very small group of lazy people, most in poverty have been working hard so badly, yet ending up with far less payment.
Nevertheless, this can be significantly improved by getting them re-educated or trained, which means the government should carry out such constructive policies as increasing the minimum wage and more investment in education and training, to ensure poor group sharing equal opportunities of education and getting hired and paid. Meanwhile, powerful corporations should take responsibilities to reduce poverty, for example, by providing scholarships or creating more job opportunities for those in need.
Essay 720:
Nowadays more and more animals are used in the scientific research. Some people believe that it is unnecessary and unacceptable as the animals are also the beautiful creature of God while others think that these experiments are necessary to make human life easier and comfortable.
According to some people, the scientific experiments on animals are totally unnecessary and irrelevant. They argue that there is a vast difference between the human body structure and the body of the animal. So the experiments done by scientists on animals are rarely effective. Also, they believe that the animals also have rights to live freely and naturally on the earth and we, as the humankind, do not have the power to treat them the way we want.
On the other hand, most of the people have the view that these experiments on animals are necessary to make human life healthier and comfortable. Scientific researches have proved that some of the animals have a similar body structure that we have. So it is advisable and feasible to do experiments on animals first and perform some basic analysis and then start experiments on humans. This approach will cause less damage and cost for the research. Apart from this, it is really hard to find the human body for scientific experiments. So scientists do not have any other option because there are very few persons present in this world who are ready to make themselves available for these experiments. One of the best examples of this is the earlier space programs carried by NASA. In the first couple of attempts, they sent the space flight carrying dogs and evaluated the results and then decided to send the space rocket carrying humans.
In conclusion, I prefer that the scientific experiments on animals are acceptable only if we do not have any other options available and also the government should implement rules and regulations to protect the identity of every animal used in such researches.
Essay 722:
Education is considered to be an essential factor in our lives. There are many ways by which education can be improved in my country. Chief among them are - the teachers’ continuous encouragement for students and the availability of interesting resources in the educational process.
It is an indisputable fact that encouragement grants confidence.  In fact, most teachers pay no attention to this notion. In contrast, they must plant incentives in their students. For example, when a teacher encourages or praises a student for any positive thing, such student will feel comfortable and confident. Consequently, his learning appetite will dramatically increase which, in turn, will reflect his excellent performance in his study.
A second factor that will develop education is the availability of interesting resources in the learning process. As a matter of fact, students begin to fed-up with the traditional way of learning since such method follows a routine basis. For this reason, it is the teachers’ responsibility to change this way of learning.  For example, teachers can bring entertaining materials within the class. In such way, students will be more interested and will concentrate much on their studies.
Finally, the government should allocate more fund for the education sector as there are still many less developed educational institute in my country. The students should be encouraged by their parents and interactive ways of education should be available in most of the schools.
To sum up, no one can ignore the importance of education. For this reason, there must be a constant encouragement for students and interesting methods for learning as well. Adopting the above ways will reap a generation of scientists of whom will shall take pride.
Essay 723:
People have argued about the existence of computers. A group of people believe that computers are beneficial for human beings, while others think that computers have made their life become more difficult. I personally believe that computers are useful for people as long as they use them proportionately.  
For a number of reasons, some people believe that computers have made their life become more complicated. Firstly, with the invention of portable computers, many companies are expecting their employees to bring home those notebooks. Many employees have felt that the condition has negatively affected to their social life. Secondly, with the innovation of internet technology, people are working at a faster pace nowadays. It is believed that this condition has increased the stress level of many employers.
However, another group of people think differently, as they believe that computers have assisted them in many aspects of their lives. With the existence of office application software, employees could easily process thousands of data in just a couple of hours. And then, with the online technology, people could stay connected with their business partners, family and relatives who live far away from them without the boundary of cost. Lastly, the computer could also be used as a platform for entertainment, as they could be utilised for playing video games, watching videos and surfing the internet.
In conclusion, it is a fact that people have different opinions about computers. Some people believe that computer has a lot of positive sides, while others think that it has more negative sides for the human being. From my point of view, it is true that computer has its own advantages and disadvantages, but I believe that if people use is wisely, the benefits of computers will outweigh the drawbacks.    
Essay 725:
Technology is permeating every realm of human beings’ lives ever since its inception. This can be manifested in biotechnology used to bring about a new combination of fruits and vegetables, and in factory farming. Some argue these practice to be rewarding one, while others question the viability of these. Both points of views will be analysed in this essay before reaching a reasonable conclusion.
It is widely believed by some that the livestock is kept in unsanitary and macabre conditions in many of factory farming arrangement while the use of modern fertilizers causes irrecoverable damage to the environment. This was manifested by many documentaries that aired during the early 1990s, that went behind the scenes of such biotechnologically produced poultry and other edibles. For many people, this inhumane treatment of livestock is enough to keep them from consuming the factory farmed meat. Thus it is understandable, why some people are vocal critics of factory farming and other similar processes.
On the other hand, some people avow, that factory farming is beneficial and for the common good of the mankind. Take, an isolated country like New Zealand, for example, for her the export of poultry produced from the poultry farms, is one of her main source of national revenue. If it wasn’t for these practices, New Zealand would probably be not as competitive as it is today. Hence, the merits of such practices are evident from this example.
For reasons related to, fair treatment of animals, environmental footprints, and economic benefits derision, the topic of factory farming and similar processes is a contentious one. After musing upon both sides of this argument, it is felt that biotechnology will continue to be used, although the tormenting of livestock in such settings, should be admonished.
Essay 726:
Today, thanks to new technology in the cyber-space, some office employees are allowed to work from home. This system has led many companies to gain more benefits, and I think this method will become more popular in the future due to the introduction of more developed web systems and facing more transport problems.
To begin with, in some companies, office staffs are permitted to work from home via telecommuting, which has been beneficial to both employers and employees. One advantage is that owners can save more money. Clearly, considering a specific room for two or more employees, expenditures can become higher than working from home because rental and utility bills can be decreased far considerably. For example, a computer software engineer can finish and send his project through the web at the end of the month; therefore, he can do his tasks from home, and lesser funds will be spent for him totally.
Another benefit is that people can save their time. Obviously, travelling several hours a day, many employees have to spend their valuable time on traffic jams, while it is not necessary they commute between their home and workplace as they work from home. As a prime example, my brother, who is an electronic engineer, had to spend almost two hours daily between his home and workplace; however, as his employers accepted he to do his duty from home, he has saved more than ten hours a week, and his performance has improved fundamentally. As a result, not only this method can be more economical, but less time-consuming.
Besides, I believe that telecommuting will become a more common system in the future. One reason behind it is that individuals will have a better access to a faster Internet. Undoubtedly, the Internet is an essential factor that assists employees to achieve their duties, so as the speed of Internet develops, huge works will be accomplished far easily from home, leading home jobs to become a commoner type of working. Furthermore, increasing traffic load, especially in sprawling cities, will encourage employers to give green light to this type of working.
In conclusion, home jobs have had many important advantages to businesses and workers, not only in the matter of their expenses but time. From my point of view, advancement in the technology of Internet and aggravation of traffic problems will cause more employees to use this system of the job.
Essay 727:
Telecommuting has become a buzzword not only among IT professionals but also among the common folks. It brings about a sea of changes in the work culture of many business settings. Though some business firms are on the fence about this new concept, my two cents is that several positive innovations come about in the society by this new concept.
Essay 728:
Undoubtedly, the rate of vandalism has grown far considerably in urban areas during last several decades. Youth are motivated to commit more variety of offences than before, and I believe that unemployment and overpopulation are two important reasons for that. Some influential solutions, considered by authorities, can reduce this rate.
To begin with, it is true that the number of violators has fundamentally grown in many cities. The first reason behind it is that the figures for jobless people have dramatically risen. Clearly, due to the economic recession of 2008, the rate of unemployment sharply increased, especially in some countries which have had a more vulnerable economy. For example, in Iran, thousands of juveniles were fired because their employers were not able to afford their wages; therefore, this group had more trends to become those offenders damaging private or public premises. To revenge the government, they have tried many times to ruin natural habitat, like firing woods. Another reason is the increasing of the global population. To control criminals, more police force should be hired; however, in many cities, insufficient police officers have created an unsafe living condition than the past. As a result, offenders, especially the young who have more energy, have found better opportunities to cross the line and commit more violations.
To address these issues, state authorities can implement some practical solutions to suppress the crime rate. One is that improving the economy. Having a better income and job positions, citizens, including juveniles, will be less interested in offences, like car robbery, shoplifting or even firing the wildlife. In addition, administrations should not only increase the number of police officers but have more practical solutions for controlling of overcrowding in cities. For instance, had the New York government followed this outline, the number of dangerous criminals would have significantly dropped.
In conclusion, economy depression and increasing the density of people, especially in urban areas, have led the rate of violence to incline. To tackle them, I think it is better governments not only create a better economy condition for citizens but consider some important plans to decrease the birth rate in cities.
Essay 730:
The taste of people for artworks have changed to an extreme extent in this present age. As a direct result, many ordinary artworks are entitled as masterpieces while true pieces go unnoticed for the lack of evaluation amid thousands of cheap pieces. I completely agree with the statement for the following reasons.
The number of art loving people has reduced significantly. With the passage of time, maintaining a decent life is difficult. So, people are busy in making a comfortable living. They hardly manage time to focus on artworks and are willing to hang the artworks on their wall or preserve them in their showcases instead of visiting them at galleries. Such activities have greatly reduced the value of real artworks.  
Besides, the real artists are losing their interest to create some extraordinary pieces for wider reasons. Firstly, they are not appreciated. Additionally, the prices of raw materials are on the rise. So, the artists lose interest to create some ‘true’ pieces due to lack of art lovers’ admiration to them. In fact, people are no longer interested in art anymore for recreation. For instance, my next door neighbour is a painter. When inquired, preferring anonymity, he told that all types of artworks started declining after the Second World War. Though there had been some changes after the 1990s, the real artworks were lost amid the cheap pieces after that decade, he said. He also believes, a large number of artist gave up job considering the matters. In fact, he was true.
Furthermore, the art galleries reduced in competition with local market artworks. The artworks meant for gallery exhibitions are confined to local markets within a cheaper price for home décor. Subsequently, the aesthetic arts are experiencing rainy days in the supremacy of ordinary pieces. So, the ordinary pieces turned dominating.
Essay 731:
‘Crime and punishment’ is rooted in the very fabric of our history and society. The rules that drive the society are meant to be obeyed and breaking them is considered as crimes and hence the society has made an arrangement to punish the offenders to maintain the peace among us. The modern concept of country is based on the primitive society people used to live in and every country has its own sets of laws for people to abide by. Many people consider prison, which was invented as part of our journey towards modernizations, as a proper place for the criminals while others opine that more severe punishment is a better alternative to maintaining the peace in a country.  I believe that prison is the most effective way of punishing wrong-doers.
First of all, putting criminals in prisons for their violation of laws was not invented in a day. That came to our society with the pace of time and from the need of a way to punish the wrong-doers. Hence this is an already proven way to punish the criminals and introducing a more efficient way would not be that easy.
Secondly, not all crimes and background of criminals are same and thus imprisonment for different time length is very much justified. For instance, someone who broke a law for the first time and a recurring offender should not be punished in the same way even though their nature or crimes is same. Here the imprisonment for various sentences could be an ideal punishment.
Thirdly, capital punishment like death sentence is too inhuman and the goal of our judicial system and law is to reform the society not to kill the criminals. The prison as a punishment offers plenty of opportunities to the offenders to remorse and become good citizens. Thus considering the true purpose of our law and order, imprisonment is the best possible punishing arrangement. Some might argue that we should hang a killer instead of letting him live in the prison. But my point of view contradicts with them as I believe that killing a murderer would make us no less than a murderer. We would be guilty of the same crime he has committed. What punishment could be crueller that letting the criminal rot in a jail alone and remorse every single moment of his life thinking about the heinous act he has done?
Finally, severe and cruel punishment systems were mostly invented by criminals themselves, especially during the wars. Following those methods to punish a wrongdoer is not justified at all. Our aim is to make the world a better place to live in while not showing mercy to the people who harm others or break the law and hence imprisonment is the best possible form of punishment in my view.
To draw the conclusion, the imprisonment is the best way to punish the criminals while maintaining the peace in the society and letting the wrong-doers remorse and become a better person in the future.
Essay 732:
The world will always develop with the time. However, the increasingly complicated problems faced by human beings have resulted in a huge number of crimes, which is crucially being all people’s concern. Regarding this, state-of-the-art technology has a fateful role in the effort to hinder and tackle any crimes haunt our societies.
In today's globalised era, people are being more secured due largely to the more sophisticated technology through many ways. This is, for example, the existence of hidden cameras which have already been provided in almost every corner of the world. It will allow us to monitor people’s activity where those cameras are put. Moreover, more sensitive tools used to detect what people bring or put in their bag or belongings have been invented. This also can help us to reduce the possibility of terrorism in which terrorists usually do by bringing bombs put on their body and burst them in important places. Furthermore, the availability of satellites and other devices to detect where criminals are located also has a big contribution in reducing the crimes committed. Another example, digital, automatic lock systems have already been installed in vehicles such as cars and motorbikes in order to prevent them from thieves.
Nonetheless, nowadays, as a result of the development of information and technology, another type of crime emerges. This includes crimes which are committed electronically, for example, deception conducted via email and websites or even activities of black hackers who often cause a great deal of loss in many corporation or countries. Therefore, measures are also conducted to solve this emerging problem such as good software to analyse any suspicious activities on the Internet which, in other words, by improving the cyber security.
Having said that, it is also probable in the future will be some human brain detectors which will, fortunately, ease people to detect any band or negative willings or purposes of people.  Consequently, before commuting crimes, they will be detected or caught at first. However, this kind of technology is still being tried by experts.
Although there are so many ways of preventing crimes including tools, devices, or systems utilised in this mission, this will never be successful without intervening the feelings of the criminals. For this reasons the most important thing is that those ways will eventually make people who are fond of doing crimes consider more or even make them recover, become educated and come back to the right way.
All in all, the development of technology has a really great importance in minimising the number of criminals whether to ease people to recognise them or to make them think much more before deciding to do so. Therefore, it is really essential to develop more highly-sophisticated technology and invent more creative ways for the sake of reaching a peaceful world.   
Essay 733:
Many countries are facing density problem these days, as their residents' population have grown rapidly in the past few years. It is believed that the way to control this issue is by charging penalties for families who have more than one child. I personally disagree with the statement and the following essay will discuss it in details about it.
For a number of reasons, charging penalties for birth control would not be an effective solution. Firstly, many countries have positive economic growth these days, which means that most of their residents' income has increased. As their income increase, it means that they could pay the respective penalties, and it would not solve the density problem. Secondly, with the implementation of penalties regulation, it will increase the abortion rate. Based on the historical data of country that has implemented the fine regulation such as China, the abortion rate is increasing significantly. Abortion is not just an inhuman act, but it would have a serious threat to the women themselves, such as tumour or cancer.
There are other ways that could be considered for solving the overpopulation problem, besides charging some fines. They could educate their residents through television and radio programs, that it would be a serious threat for the future generation. They could inform that as the number of people in the earth increase, the demand for food and housing will automatically rise, which means that it would be a problem for the future descendants. And then, governments could also give campaigns about the usage of birth control tools for adults couples such as condoms or spiral. By using these kinds of approaches, it is hoped that population problem will gradually decrease.
In conclusion, it is a fact that a lot of countries have overpopulation issue these days, and it is suggested that governments should charge some penalties for families who have more than one child. I do not agree with the suggestion, as there are other ways in which governments could consider such as giving campaign about birth controls.
Essay 735:
Nowadays, the usage of own means of transport is very common in the modern societies. It creates the problem of traffic congestion and pollution all over the world. However, the use of public transport is one of the possible solutions to deal with this issue.
Firstly, overuse of private cars leads to traffic congestion. Every person has their own car, which means creating a lot of traffic. For instance, in metro cities, it is often seen that there is traffic jam more than an hour and people are blowing the horns, thus worsening the situation. Ultimately, all this cause frustration and stress for the people who cannot reach at their workplaces in due time. Moreover, the sound and environmental pollutions are increasing.
Secondly, more motor vehicles mean more pollution. The harmful gases exhausted from the vehicle results in air pollution and leads to various health problems. For example respiratory diseases such as asthma, bronchitis and so on. Moreover, ozone layer depletion as a consequence of pollution can cause skin problems.
The possible solution to these problems is to maximise the use of public transport. The government should aware the people to use public transport and put emphasis to legally control the private transportation. Furthermore, the use of public transport also saves the expenditure which we spend on buying own means of transportation.
To conclude, traffic congestion and pollution are the arising problems of extensive use of private means of transportation. Nevertheless, the use of public transport is the one way to resolve the problems. Both Government and individual should come forward to tackle this issue and make their place better to live.
Essay 736:
In today's modern world, the number of private cars is increasing tremendously following the development of technology.  It, inevitably, causes many unanticipated negative consequences on people's lives due to the overreliance on their cars even for a short distance journey. Therefore, it is important for us to establish the possible side effects on our lives and also the effective measures to cope with this problem.
Admittedly, there are a number of unwanted negative impacts of overuse of private cars. To begin, the physical strength of people will decline over the years and it becomes more noticeable in the late adulthood. People nowadays are too dependent on their own vehicles which cause them to have limited time to exercise so as to maintain good health. Thus, it is not uncommon that many of them to fall in sick easily, especially the children who are vulnerable to diseases. Furthermore, with the increasing number of private cars, traffic problems may become more severe in big cities it may also cause air pollution. People have to spend more time while travelling from one place to another due to heavy traffic jam. In addition, air pollution may have side effects on people's health when they inhale the unfiltered exhaust gases from vehicles.
Nevertheless, there are tonnes of ways which could prove useful and effective in curbing this problem. Firstly, city inhabitants should strive to reduce their dependency on cars. To illustrate, they can choose to brisk walk to the shops nearby whenever they need to buy groceries without driving. It is indirectly giving a valuable opportunity for them to exercise so as to rebuild their bodies and regain health. Besides, it is advisable for the government to promote car pool. It is proven to be one of the effective ways to solve this problem, not only it will reduce the traffic problems which they are now facing every day in a city, but also reduce the exposal of waste effluents from the cars. Sooner or later, they will be able to live healthily in the near future.
In conclusion, there are several unanticipated problems that are caused by overreliance on private cars, however, there are numerous effective ways to tackle this problem. I believe the citizens of our nation will be free from the negative side effects of this problem one day provided every individual cooperates and practice the stated ways.
Essay 737:
Usages of private vehicles as the main transportation media is rife and has grown abundantly among citizens. This reliance on private cars, somehow, can trigger several impacts, for instances, increasing traffic jam and elevating air pollution. These problems will be elaborated through the following paragraphs.
Traffic jam is considered as the impact of an imbalanced capacity of roads towards the number of cars and other means of transportation. As vehicle and other commuter lines grow significantly, moreover, when people tend to use their personal cars which obviously increase the quantity of vehicle on road, the road cannot provide fair space to allow all cars running smoothly. As a result, people have to encounter the traffic jam.
Despite traffic jam, air pollution also becomes classic problem of car growth. The higher the rate of cars operated, the higher the amount of residual fume produced by motor activities. This phenomenon can elevate the amount of CO2 in the air which contributes major pollutant in the air pollution and damage people’s health.
In my point of view, one of the solutions dealing with this traffic issue is by increasing tax payment for private cars and motorcycle. Imposing high tax for private vehicle users will affect their judgment in using their cars as they have to spend extra money to run their own vehicles. Whitehorse city, for example, has managed to give higher tax for personal car users and as the fact, citizen there prefer using public buses than private cars due to less cost paid for public bus transport.
Essay 738:
Nowadays, more students choose to study abroad than ever before. While there are good benefits in studying in a foreign country, I believe that the drawbacks outweigh the positive impacts this trend has.
On the one hand, there are many benefits of studying abroad. Firstly, overseas students become more independent by living alone in foreign country. For instance, they are responsible for cleaning, cooking, and paying bills. Secondly, moving to other countries can broaden students’ horizons. They get exposed to different cultures and customs and gain knowledge about them. Also, overseas students learn foreign languages to cope with the new culture they involved in. Finally, foreign institutions offer better courses for students .The qualification gained open the door to get better job opportunities with high salaries.
On the other hand, I would argue that studying abroad has more negative impacts than the positive one. One problem is that it can affect students psychologically. Studying alone in an unfamiliar culture can lead to homesickness or even depression. Also, this different culture may lead to culture shock which may affect the student’s performance. Another drawback of studying overseas is that students can experience some problems with paperwork like visa permit and may struggle to find suitable accommodation and paying their bills. This may add more pressure on the students and interrupt their studying. Furthermore, the language barrier may exacerbate the situation. Studying in a foreign language is a difficult task to many students and if they failed to master the language and communication skill, this may lead to the isolation from the community and might cause a failure in studying.
It is true that the number of students who choose to study overseas has increased rapidly in the past few years. Studying in a foreign country has its own positive and negative sides, but I personally believe that it has more benefits for the students themselves.
On the one hand, some believe that the choice of studying abroad have some disadvantages. One of the reasons is that studying overseas will cost more than studying in the home country. It is necessary for parents to spend more money on airplane tickets, accommodations, foods and clothes, besides tuition fees and uniforms. Another reason is that students might be unfamiliar and uncomfortable with the culture, environment and language of the new country. As a consequence, it might have a negative effect on their mental condition and academic performance. Adopting in a new environment often hampers the natural flow of study for many students and some students do not continue their study to earn money when they are abroad.
On the other hand, another group of people think that studying in another country brings so many positive aspects for the students themselves.  Firstly, by studying in a new country, students will have a chance to learn new languages and new cultures. Secondly, students will learn about how to live independently, like cleaning their own rooms or doing the laundry by themselves. Thirdly, they could make new friends with people from other countries and get familiar with multicultural environments. Lastly, it is a fact that in certain countries, international graduate certificate gives additional values when the students search for jobs.
In conclusion, it is undeniable that the preference of studying in a foreign country has its own benefits and drawbacks. Despite all the disadvantages, I believe that it has more advantages for the students themselves, therefore young people should be encouraged to study in a new country. Although some of them might have difficulties with the fees, but many international scholarships are offered these days.
Essay 740:
In today’s modern world, many students plan to go to university immediately after they finish school. However, some people assert that it would be more beneficial if they can go on a trip or start on working for a certain period of time before attending university courses. Therefore, it is important for us to establish the positive and negative impacts of this argument before we reach a reasonable conclusion.
Undoubtedly, those who wish to widen their view by travelling or working will certainly have more experience and are more knowledgeable than others who go to university after they finish school. When they travel to other countries, they are being exposed to a new environment with different lifestyles, thus they will probably learn the cultures and traditions from the locals. They may be more open-minded and have higher adaptability than others. Besides, working may benefit them by opening up an avenue to allow them to meet a wide variety of new people every day. It is proven that they can, sooner or later, develop an excellent interpersonal skill which plays an indispensable role when they enter a university. By measuring the crucial social skill, they can interact with others more confidently.
Nevertheless, there is always another side of a coin. Travelling abroad and working for a part-time job do have detrimental side effects. One of the major drawbacks is they may be graduated from university later than their friends of the same age due to the reason that they need to experience more from travelling and working which require them to spend one or two years, or even more time. According to a recent research conducted in Malaysia, human’s interpretation and learning ability deteriorate as we get older which clearly explains that our learning progress will be slowed down if we start our tertiary education late. As a consequence, they may fail to achieve their aspirations even though they have more life experience than others.
In conclusion, I think every student has their own choice in dealing whether to start tertiary education after they finish school or to travel abroad or work for a short period so as to gain more experience before attending university. I believe they can achieve their set goals if they are willing to work hard regardless of experience and age barriers.
Essay 742:
It is true that the heavy use of computers and cell phones would have a negative impact on young people. However, I am not totally convinced that it would necessarily deter their writing and reading skills.
On one hand, relying too much on computers and mobile phones would effect on teenagers not to become proficient in some basic skills. Since computers and mobile phones come with a word processor accompanied with spellchecker, teenager's handwriting will probably suffer. For instance, young people who excessively depend on computers or mobile phones may not be able to write a letter by hand. In addition, reading through computers and mobile phones do not encourage teenagers to read long stories or high volume research books. They do not develop a reading habit that enables them to broaden their knowledge. Furthermore reading long passages through these devices could be very harmful to their eyes.
On the other hand, I believe that for some reasons, computers and cell phones would benefit young people's reading and writing abilities. Firstly, reading through computers and cell phones engage young people in learning and grasping knowledge. The ease of access to the information makes reading more interesting. For example, many of us stop reading a certain book because its introduction put him or her off continuing. While by surfing the Internet we can find the information that we interested on without a need to read the whole book. Secondly, using computers and mobile phones improve some writing skills, which are useful in future jobs such as word processors for making reports, power point program, making notes in telephone or even learn the meaning or the spelling of a word that we have never come across.
Essay 743:
In today's modern world, the cases of people who are facing health related problems are increasing dramatically. Hence, there are numerous people who assert that it is crucial for the government to increase the number of sports facilities in order to tackle this problem. However, some people are of the opinion that other effective ways are needed as sports facilities would have a minimum impact on their health. In this essay, we will examine both sides of the arguments before reaching a reasonable conclusion.
Undoubtedly, there is a direct link between the increase in the number of sports facilities and the public health. To begin, people are being offered a valuable opportunity to do more exercises. Nowadays, the sports facilities are too expensive and are not affordable by an individual with low income. Thus, the provided sports facilities will definitely give them a chance to keep fit without the need of spending a huge chunk of money to buy sports equipment. According to a recent research, the weight of a person will decline for about 5kg in 3 week time if they do exercise regularly, for example, 30 minutes a day. As a result, health-related problems like obesity and high blood pressure can be avoided.
Nevertheless, in the twenty-first century, people focus solely on their works which cause them to have very limited time to do exercise. Thus, the increasing number of sports facilities may have little or no effect on their health as they do not access to them frequently. Other measures which could prove useful in curbing this health problem are, therefore, required. One of the effective measures is increasing the number of health care units which allows the city inhabitants to seek for guidance and to have a body checkup regularly. A study has shown that people these days are more rely on figures on their medical checkup reports to help them to maintain good health. For example, doctors will advise their patients to reduce the intake of glucose-rich food if they are diabetic patients. The following preventive measures are that government should organise more campaigns which promote the importance of having a healthy body. Once the public realises the negative impacts of health problems have in their lives, they may probably pick up the good habits to maintain good health.
In conclusion, sports facilities are, admittedly, opening up an avenue for the public to do more exercises, however, I believe there are more useful preventive measures that can be taken to improve our health. Our nation will continue to prosper and flourish if every citizen owns a healthy body which allows them to contribute endlessly to the society.
Essay 744:
In our modern society, the question how to improve public health has been widely discussed. A fair portion of people believes that increasing the number of sports facilities is the best way to improve public health, while others hold the opposite point of view. As for me, I believe that increasing number of sports facilities and medical care are both important to improve public health.
First, more sports facilities, such as gym and football playground, can offer the great improvement of public health. Nowadays, we have more pressure from work, life and even relationship, so doing exercise becomes a good way to relax. For example, the gyms of Pure and California Fitness have already placed in many areas. The recently published data shows that, in HongKong, increasing number of businessmen prefer to go to the gym after work, which can definitely improve public health. Therefore, more and more sports facilities can improve public health.
Second, people should pay more attention to medical care, which is another import way to improve public health. In my hometown, for instance, the government made a new policy in 2014, which was to encourage people, especially elderly people, to do the body check at least once a year. The government would pay the half fee for body check for all citizens. This policy makes more and more people can prevent serious disease in the early stage. Medical care set by our government improves public health efficiently. In this case, another perfect way is to pay more attention to medical care.
In my opinion, it is impossible to say that there is only one way to improve public health. We should work both on increasing numbers of sports facilities and setting up more medical cares for public. Both of the ways can keep us healthy and away from getting bad diseases.
It is highly debated that whether more numbers of sports facilities is the most significant solution to improve public health or other practices are essential along with. Sports obviously help people to build strong body structure and peaceful state of mind, but it cannot independently increase the level of public health. However, both groups have strong points in their respective choice.
Sports have been an important part of human life. Some people agree that it significantly make human health better on the ground that it makes people physically strong. Addition in sports facilities number is believed to attract more people to engage in athletic activities. People want to perform good sports and skills when they play any game, which promotes them to eat sufficient and supportive diets. This helps to maintain good public health. As increasing the number of sports facilities encourage more people to engage in such activities, and sports itself motivate human beings to take care of their health, addition in a number of sports is the best choice to maintain a good public health.
In the other hand, most people believe additional measures are required for a significant positive change in public health in addition to more sports facilities number, for example, public awareness regarding balanced diet, environmental issues and proper daily life practices. It cannot be expected that the number of people engaging in sports will dramatically increase only because there are more numbers of such facilities. Motivating programmes should be applied to encourage people to make sports an essential part of their life. Also, proper diet plan and adopting natural agricultural process are important as well. Regarding mental health, meditation and travelling are required in addition to sports. For example, my friend significantly improved his health playing football along with proper diet plan and meditation.
Health and fitness of people are declining and it has become a focus issue recently. Some individuals argue that improving exercise facilities can be the best effort to increase community health. However, some others believe that sports facility only accounts the little effect on health and other actions should be made to develop health. This essay will discuss both these views through the following paragraphs.
To begin with, lack of workout is believed as one of the risk factors of several illnesses since it is required to secrete energy and maintain cardiovascular health. Low participation of people in doing exercise can be influenced by a limited number of sports centre available. Thus, improving sports facilities can be a good alternative providing favourable and measurable workout equipment for individuals. Canada, for example, has successfully reduced the prevalence of hypertension in that country since a number of workout centres are ubiquitous and people have become more intense visiting sports club to do a regular workout.
Despite workout, food intake also significantly determines public health. Several health issues are associated with poor diet consumption. Diabetic, for instance, becomes susceptible to people consuming fast-food mostly in their daily meal as it may improve the number of excessive glucose and trans-fat into the body. Hence, one of the solutions for this dietary problem is by reducing fast-food consumption and adopting a norm of organic food into daily account.
Among other effective measures, the government should encourage people to use the bicycle and walk to reach their workplace. The office authorities should also encourage people to move whenever possible and should persuade them to work out during breaks.
All in all, attracting people’s enthusiasm to exercise more often by increasing sports centre and changing diet habit from fast-food to organic one are necessary for elevating community health degree.
Essay 745:
Global population has increased considerably may be due to several causes. To begin, increased life expectancy in the twenty-first century allows people nowadays to live longer. A recent research has shown that people these days are more long-lived than people in the past. This may be mainly due to the advanced technology used in medical fields which are able to cure and prevent the diseases that are previously untreatable. On the other hand, people these days are more educated which allows them to secure a decent position in a company with a high paid. In other words, they have no financial problems and therefore able to have more children.
I agree that the continued rise in global population is the largest problem faced by government. This is because people live in the third world countries may be facing problems like poverty. There may be no sufficient resources to meet their demands which may eventually lead to more starvation. Besides, the increased global population will probably cause the disease to spread easily. The more crowded the population is, the more easily spread the disease, especially those air-borne diseases.
In conclusion, the increase in the world’s population is caused by numerous factors and I strongly agree that it is the biggest problem we are facing now. However, I believe there are a handful of possible measures which the governments can take to tackle this problem and mitigate against the possible negative impacts on our lives.
Essay 747:
Technology has been fascinating the mankind for decades now. Television is such marvels of modern technology. It is agreed that television has changed the quality of life of an ordinary person. This will be proved by looking at television’s ability to, alleviate boredom, and empower people.
To begin, television has provided humans with a viable past time without even leaving the comfort of their homes. For instance, instead of going through the hassle of getting to a movie theatre, a person can simply order a pay per view movie of their own choice by merely dialling few digits from their telephone. This luxury was not available to our ancestors, who didn’t have the blessing of television bestowed upon them and as a result had to endure a painstaking amount of boredom in their spare time. Thus, with television, the life quality of an ordinary person has made a quantum leap.
Furthermore, since the inception of television, informative programs have been empowering ordinary people to take actions which have the potential to change the course of their lives. For instance, it was through one such television program, that I came to know about the power of a human’s subconscious mind, which ultimately helped me to, admonish all limiting beliefs that I had about my abilities, and lead a much happier and  fulfilling life.

Essay 748:
It is obvious that parents play a huge role in children's lives. Generally, most of the children start their lives with their parents and thus learning basic things from them. It is our father and mother who teach us how to communicate with others, how to speak and how to behave. I believe that parents influence the future of children in so many ways.
First of all, we not only receive physical traits from our parents but also we get their habits and manners. Sometimes, we do not even realise that we are copying the behaviours of our parents. For example, my mother has brought me up to value the time. She told me to get on time to school and to submit the homework in a timely manner. She also encouraged me to prepare in advance. She showed a good example to me. She prepared everything beforehand and she has never been late to her work or any social events. She was praised by families and friends for being punctual and I wanted to be like her. Examples set by parents shape the way their children are.
In addition, parents are the one whom the children spent most of their time with. Numerous studies have proven that the young age, between the ages of three to five, when children start learning is an important period. At the early age, children tend to learn and memorise what parents do and they accept it as the right thing to do in their lives as well. For instance, the first words of the toddler who has to live with the parents who usually swear will be the abusive words. The children who have to live the smoking parents are more likely to smoke at teenage.
Essay 749:
It is a fact that many employees insist their employees to work from home these days and this is due to the fact that advancement in technology has made is possible for many employees, especially related to IT and communication sectors, to work from anyplace. The work culture has been drastically changed from last decades. People can work from any avenue and at any time. Let’s discuss the effects on this trend in detail.
Firstly, the advancement of technology has made it possible for most of the people to work from different parts of the globe. An unavoidable fact is that the percentage of people working from home has been drastically increased in recent days. These factors affect positively for collaborating the resources all the time. Moreover, the efforts of work will not be diversified due to lack of resource availability. The most important feature of advancement in technology is collaboration, this is seen as one way of collaboration the resources.
In addition to the above fact, the people can easily attend meetings and respond to the calls or assist team members, if any major issue's encountered in the system. Most likely, people tend to work more productively without the intervention of human or environmental barriers. In fact, the workload can be planned properly and can report to the respective teams for the deliverable. Nowadays people cannot relax as the fact they work from home, it can trace easily by many advanced tools which track the status of people's availability. The most observed fact is that many women can utilise their talent and skill in workplaces as the work from home allows them to work in a company.
Perhaps the negative aspects of the above work culture should also be considered. There is a famous saying "for every action there will be an equal and opposite reaction". All the above facts are only applicable if the employee works and utilises the timely effort in a reasonable way. People working from home could easily divert their concentration on other things. Most often individual can involve in implementing own or personal stuff than official work. The deliverable can affect if an individual is non-responsive. Some technical issues can encounter like networking, connectivity to the workstation and the slow responsiveness.
In conclusion, the work culture has been scaled to the flexibility of each individual, if the facility is utilised in a correct way, the outcome will be more effective to individual and to the organisation. Perhaps if there is any deviation then the productivity will be lowered. It depends on the fact of each individual's ethics and the responsibility. This culture is useful in various ways, the percentage of working people has increased and many women genders are able to contribute to the society.
Essay 750:
From the positive perspective, it does benefit to the work-life balance. For example, employees do not have to spend their time on shuttling between their office and home. The saved time can be spent on their work or taking care of their families. Therefore, the pressure of their work and personal life can be alleviated to a certain extent. Another advantage is the flexible working hour which is conducive to staff's efficiency. It is more reasonable to arrange different kinds of work on different time section. Furthermore, conducting meetings with the customer from different time zone has become more realistic by this practice.
Form the negative perspective, the staff management is a big challenge to many companies. As staff remote to work from home, their managers cannot monitor what they are doing during the working hours. It would cause the lack of effective control and management to their staff. It would greatly impact on the normal run of a company and it is a great waste of human resource which is the last result employers would like to see. However, this concern can be address by utilising some technology or measures. For instance, the company can install the monitoring software in their staff's laptop to oversee working situations, such as, what software they use and which websites they are browsing during working hours. Furthermore, the strict management measure is a key too. Managers should conduct an effective communication with their staff and estimate the appropriate volume of work for the staff so as to ensure they are reasonably occupied by their work.
To sum up, working from home is good for work-life balance and the work efficiency. Nevertheless, it is necessary for employers to take effective measures to ensure employees to be under a good management, such as, installing monitoring software and assigning the reasonable volume of work to their staff.
In today’s modern world, the computer technology is being developed at a fast pace which opens up an avenue for people to work at their own homes and communicate with employers and other employees via video conferences. Thus, it is important for us to establish the possible impacts on the employees who work at home.
There are several advantages of working at home instead of working in an office. To begin, the employees will have more flexible times to decide when to start working. For example, they can choose their working time which starts from 9.30am to 6pm, or they can also choose to extend their working time with some breaks in between. In fact, it should be made more common by providing people around the globe for working at home as the employees do not need to commute to work every day which normally takes a long time to reach their workplace from their home. The time they spend on commuting is more valuable if the employees can use it on working. Undoubtedly, it will not cause any harm to the company, but help to increase the work efficiency.
The next benefit of it is that housewives can get an opportunity to work even though they have to stay at home all day long. Most women tend to sacrifice to quit their current job after they get married as they believe that they need to stay at home to manage all the households well in order to be a responsible housewife. Thus, it is apparent that if most of the company provide jobs to work at home, the housewives will be able to continue to contribute to the society and earn more money to support their family financially. According to the statistic of a recent research conducted in Malaysia, it has shown that more than half of the married women wish to work at home owing to the fact that they can take care of their children and work simultaneously. Therefore, it has clearly shown that working at home provide the housewives with an opportunity to contribute to the society.
Nevertheless, there is always another side of a coin. It is believed that working at home rather than in the workplace will eventually weaken the ability of an employee to socialise. If the employees were to work at home, they will probably have not much time to interact with others as they focus solely on their works. Even though some people might say that they utilise the convenience of the internet to socialise with others through the social media like Facebook and Twitter, it is proven, however, proven that the way people socialise online is totally different from interacting face-to-face. As a result, it may cause the people these days who work at home without interacting with others face-to-face to develop relationship crisis as they are not equipped with the crucial interpersonal skills.
In conclusion, there are both positive and negative impacts of working at home on the employees it is, however, believed that every employee can contribute endlessly to our nation regardless of where they work and our nation will continue to prosper and flourish in the years to come.
Essay 752:
Ever since the liberalisation of media, advertisements have been its primary source of revenue. Children, who are in their formative years, are more likely to be influenced by advertisements than their elder counterparts, are regularly targeted by the marketers. It is agreed that this has negative effects on children, thus, shall be banned. This will be proven by looking at how, these advertisements can ultimately make children defiant, and play a part in distracting children from academic activities.
To begin, when children are exposed to advertisements of products that their parents can’t afford to provide for them, children often resort to defying both, their parents, and society. For instance, it is a known fact that most children, who go on to become rebels, had been deprived of their wishes for items that they don’t even need, nor can afford, such as elegant toys and expensive mobile phones. This shows that advertisements of certain kinds of products can lead children to develop delinquent tendencies. Hence, promotional material that targets children has more than its fair share of disadvantages.
In addition to this, a large number of the flashy advertisements can subconsciously have a detrimental effect on a child’s academics.  For instance, after being barraged by an endless amount of advertisements in a short span of time, juveniles can lose their ability to focus on a certain task for an extended period of time. Thus being exposed to such advertisements can take its toll on a child’s brain. After analysing this, the demerits of advertisements targeting children are manifested.
Following this look at how advertisements aimed at children can, undermine their behaviour, and hinder the achievement of their academic objectives, it is evident that these advertisements have adverse effects on children. Thus it is hoped that governments should muse upon banning of such advertisements.
Essay 753:
A group of people believe that the existence of organizations or groups is an essential part of their lives. There various reasons why organizations are important for several people and the following essay will discuss in details regarding the statement. 
To begin with, it is true that people have different professions. Some people decide to be an entrepreneur, while others prefer to work in an institution or an organization. As for those who choose to be a professional worker, the existence of corporations or companies is an essential part of their lives. They are relying on their employer for the income, benefit and facilities, and they also believe that their workplace is the place where they could develop their skill and talent. Besides that, the workplace can also be used as the place for interaction, communication and socialization as well.
From the humanity's point of view, many people believe that the existence of a non-profit organization is important. There are various kinds of non-profit foundations and institutions such as World Health Organization, World Wide Fund, Salvation Army or UNICEF. These organizations are helping mankind who live in poverty, threats of war or those who are facing natural disasters such as tsunami or earthquake. And the existence of these organizations has saved tens of millions of people all over the world, as they supply food, clothing and medical supplies. It is obvious that their existences are vital for the struggle and survival of some people.
In conclusion, it is believed that organizations or groups play an important part for some people's live. Some people who become professional workers think that the existence of their company is crucial for them, as they are financially dependent on their company. While from the social perspective, it can be seen that many people who live in poor condition or suffer from wars still depend on non-profit organizations.
Essay 755:
As the world’s population grows so does the unemployment rates in most countries. This leads many people to avow that education beyond primary school level is not needed. It is disagreed that education beyond primary school level is no longer needed, no matter how high or low the unemployment rates get. This will be proven by looking at the sophistication that higher education brings with it and how education helps to differentiate between the more productive and less productive people.
To begin, the merits of education beyond primary school level are not limited to the technical knowledge gained from the studies, they extend to the courtesies and etiquettes learned by students as they get more mature through education. For instance, it is no secret that bullying amongst children is highest up until high school, it starts to diminish from thereon as students become more in-tune to the wrongs and rights. If youngsters, start to drop out of school after primary level, those bullies, could go on to become juvenile delinquents. After analysing this, it is clear that education beyond primary level is indeed fruitful for the society at large.
Furthermore, in absence of education, it would be harder for prospective employers to choose between more competent and less competent people. A scenario where all job applicants for a particular job are primary school level qualified, employers would be hard pressed to select the best possible candidate for the said job, illustrates this point well. Unfortunately, if there are no criteria, upon which to decide between potential employees, the recruitment process will become inept. Hence, education beyond primary school level plays a pivotal role in hiring process.
In summary, higher education has a significant part to play in humanising the youth, and in distinguishing between the skilled and the unskilled. Thus, I beg to differ with the idea that education beyond primary level is not needed. It is hoped that people will continue to acquire knowledge through education, regardless of the levels of unemployment.
It is a fact that several countries have a high unemployment rate nowadays. Therefore it is not necessary for the people to complete secondary school level. I personally disagree with the statement and the following essay will discuss it in details.
It is undeniable that some countries have problems with unemployment these days. With the modern industrialisation, companies are reducing their employees gradually as they prefer to use the high technology machinery. And then many third world countries such as India, Pakistan or Bangladesh have a large population, but only several of them have high education. While the demand of low skill job is getting lesser, the population of low-skill workers is increasing rapidly in the past few years. As a result, the number of unemployed people has become higher than ever nowadays.
Based on that fact, it is really important for people to have good and high education. To obtain the qualification, people should have obtained the basic education that starts from the basic level until the senior high school. When the numbers of educated people in the country increase, they could get a lot of benefits. One of them is that more people will understand about birth control, which is important for controlling the population. And as the country's population slowly decreases, the unemployment rate will also gradually decline. Therefore, it is really important for the government to provide a decent education for their people.
In conclusion, it is true that many countries are facing unemployment issues currently. But I disagree if we should eliminate high school to solve the issues. Higher education would have a positive effect on the unemployment rate and therefore I recommend all children should complete their education until high school.
Essay 757:
Overpopulation in cities and urban areas is a growing problem that governments and individuals have to take into account seriously. They should work together to reduce the inconveniences caused by it. This essay will examine what are the issues caused by overcrowding and discuss on solutions.
First of all, we can truly affirm that the first result of overpopulation in towns is without any doubts congestion and traffic jams which lead to serious pollution problems. Another inconvenience due to overcrowding is garbage from inhabitants. Many cities do not have the means to handle the charge of rubbish casting away by its habitants which lead to unclean cities.
However and fortunately, if we sit down a minute to think about what each of us could do to tackle this problem it is not hard to find a solution. Individuals should use public transports as often as they can rather than using their own car and the government should build more roads and improve public transportation to address this issue.
To handle the garbage flowing in streets they should sort out rubbish they throw away. For accommodation problems, the poorest should establish the sharing flats system. The government can expand the area and can help building more building to handle the accommodation issue.
On its own side, governments might set a tax for car owners and develop public transports back with the earned money. For a cleaner city, they should create advertisements in order to educate its people about what to do with rubbish and give a fine to someone spotted for throwing a paper, rubbish or dust in the street. Finally, to overcome the accommodation problem governments should build more infrastructures for people in need.
Ever since the industrial revolution, people have been migrating to urban centres in droves. Hence, cities have become overcrowded, which in turn has resulted in many hardships for their dwellers. It is argued that high costs of living and rising transport difficulties are two of the most serious problems brought about by overpopulation in cities. To tackle these issues, suburb developments and infrastructural changes will be analysed for viability.
The rising number of population in metropolitan places has caused significant repercussions. This has resulted in the incessant spread of pollution and an escalation of poverty. However, there are several preventive measures that the government can implement in order to address this social problem.
Primarily, it is often said that an increase of inhabitants in a well-established region is accompanied by a rise in pollution. In cosmopolitan regions, there are impoverished groups who live in squalor. Some of them have chosen to settle in the city because they believe that that they can easily find an employment in this place. For example, in the Philippines, there are poor individuals who built homes in the boulevard of Metro Manila, thus contributing to the amount of waste. Clearly, these people dispose of their rubbish to the ocean, which may harm marine animals. In addition, it is apparent that most of the less affluent cohort has a large number of families. These members have personal needs, which cause a burden to the breadwinner of the family. Since the city has a number of educated workers the impecunious group often seems to struggle in searching a better employment. To illustrate, they cannot procure a decent job since they did not finish their education. Hence, these people will suffer from poverty, which results in higher incidences of famine.
However, it can never be denied that the government can implement platforms, which will mitigate the social dilemma. First of all, they can increase the number of employment offers in suburbs such as providing them lands that can be cultivated. Therefore, impoverished people will not aggregate in the city. Secondly, the government can provide programs such as sex education to these individuals. As an instance, public health practitioners can orient them the appropriate use of contraceptives, which will control the number of family members.
To conclude, the proliferation of pollution and the exacerbation of poverty are the negative ramifications of a rise of residents in the city. Nevertheless, government’s projects can curtail this social issue. It is very likely that the poverty will be in control if the government provides them job opportunities in suburbs.
Essay 759:
Musing on and planning about future are some of the most pleasurable mental activities one can perform. Many argue, that this is a waste of time. Nonetheless, I believe thinking and planning about future is one of the cardinal rules for success. To illustrate this, the optimal performance of subconscious mind when working towards a goal and ability to deal with unforeseeable events when one is prepared for the unknown will be analysed in this essay.
To begin, of paramount importance in achieving success, is the functionality of human’s subconscious mind. For instance, most self-help authors avow that the subconscious mind works like a guided missile, once a target for future is set, it follows the path that would lead to the achievement of those objectives. A person’s mind without a thorough plan would be derailed from the track that would lead to the realisation of their dreams. This example debunks the idea that planning for and pondering on future is a waste of time.
In addition, individuals who plan ahead of time, are better equipped to deal with the curve balls that life throws at them than their counterparts who choose to live in the moment. For instance, before deciding upon the mentor to be hired for one of my research projects, I spent a painstaking amount of time, gathering information about authorities, whom to contact, in case that the selected mentor did not have a credential that he or she boasts about having. Since I took the time to do this, when my selected mentor did turn out to a fraudster, I knew immediately who to report him to. Thus, as my personal experience taught me, planning in advance can save us from the worst scenarios that could play out.
As a result, due to the higher probability of achieving one’s goals and improved ability to deal with unexpected outcomes, it is clear that planning for and thinking about future is not a waste of time. I feel that people should devote enough time to practice this.
Essay 760:
In recent years, the internet has brought significant changes to our lives especially as tools of communication. Yet, there remain some disagreements that there has been a doubt from people to the internet in looking for true information. While, there are certainly valid arguments to the contrary. I personally believe that the benefits of the internet far outweigh its drawbacks.
First of all, it is an indisputable fact that the internet has revolutionised the way we communicate. Despite there are some problems of social isolation, for example a problem occasionally seen in people who spend their time with computer terminal rather than relating to people in the real world, most of us have been benefited by the internet as useful and powerful tools of communication both to contact with loved ones in faraway places and to predict the price movement in global trade. Take the use of video call internet access as an example; people can communicate to their relatives by using it to make clear face to face conversation in terms of releasing homesickness each other. As a result, people’s sense of belonging would increase and distance problems have no meaning anymore.
Turning to the other side of the argument, the internet, although, has placed the entire world at our fingertips and make all of the information can be accessed by a few click of a mouse. Admittedly, not all of them available on the internet are reliable and helpful because it could be changed by irresponsible people. This phenomenon causing some people tend more to choose printed newspaper than to read online information. Now, however, there have been provided newspapers that could be downloaded into a smartphone as the mobile trusted information.
All things considered, I once again restate that the internet has had a positive impact on modern life because of its influence on communication. Nevertheless, there is a think concerning the flow of information on the internet not all covering true news.
Essay 761:
The world's biggest cities are alluring new inhabitants the way giant sponges suck the water out of their surrounding areas. Despite the various benefits the cities can provide, the quality of life suffers under a diverse set of environmental and socio-economic issues. In this essay, the most prevalent reasons for this issue and viable solutions will be discussed.
One of the most critical reasons for the shattering quality of city life is various environmental pollutions. The smog in capital cities and other high-density urban areas - e.g. Shanghai and Los Angeles - has become unbearable for their inhabitants and require the undertaking of great measures. Another critical reason for deteriorating urban life quality is the intensified crime rates. For that reason, people are living under constant fear and threat; leaving them prone to stress-related diseases and higher probabilities of falling victims of crimes. For instance, in some of Latin America's biggest cities, it is not recommended for women to walk alone in the streets even during daylight and this city is not alone.
For the problems, there are always solutions. Referring back to the pollution problem, the cure has been declared mainly by the means of cleaner energy and transportation systems. Many so-called 'green cities' like Copenhagen are leading the way in the development of higher quality public transports and prioritising light vehicle traffic. Dealing with crimes is far more complicated. Psychologists believe that a more beautiful, clean and happy external environment can reduce crime levels. Thus, this can be something city planners should look into more deeply when planning our urban areas. But most likely, providing people sufficient amount of opportunities and guidance in their lives would be the most effective prevention measure as far as I believe.
To conclude, there are many adversities that can reduce the urban life quality such as environmental pollution and crime; however, there are also opportunities and tools to reduce these effects. Mainly, planning our cities more wisely by taking care of negative environmental and socio-economic effects on peoples' well-being, is necessary and doable.
Essay 762:
Rapid industrialisation and urbanisation from the beginning of this century have drastically changed the urban landscape and brought unprecedented possibilities and opportunities - but not without the cost of declining living standards for city dwellers. Exponential population growth and unplanned urbanisation are the primary reasons for this declining quality of life. Proper urban planning, investing in public transports and offering government subsidies could be some effective solutions, in my opinion. 
The prosperity and opportunity in big cities have attracted a huge number of people and the inrush of the population to major cities all around the world paradoxically made life difficult for all. With the ever-increasing inhabitants, cities become overcrowded, expensive, competitive and polluted. Growing competition shoot the property rent, makes employment difficult and increases traffic congestions. For example, the higher residents in many capital cities around the world make them congested, exorbitantly expensive and polluted. Therefore, urban citizens, especially the less well off, often experience a lower standard of living and get exposed to the negative sides of urban life.
Considering the solutions, first, better planning is required. Some important amenities like public parks, sports centres, alternative roads and other infrastructures and facilities could dramatically enhance people's quality of living. Extensive investment in public transports would ease traffic congestion and make better transportation accessible to all. In theory, this would reduce air pollution, and possibly improve the well-being of the population. Finally, the government has to heavily subsidise important sectors like healthcare, education and entertainment so that they do not get more expensive and unaffordable by poor and middle-class people. 
To conclude, the city attracts large population inflows basically with the promises of a better life, which, paradoxically then cause pressure on existing infrastructure, living costs and life standard. To mitigate such drawbacks, we need to have proper solutions including better planning and more government subsidies.
Essay 763:
It is believed that the quality of life in big cities is declining and people who live in big cities always complain about numerous issues they face. The following essay will discuss some major reasons behind the issue, and some steps that people and government could do to resolve the problem.  
For a number of reasons, many people believe that the quality of life in cosmopolitan cities such as New Delhi, London, Beijing, New York,  and Jakarta is degrading. Firstly, it is obvious that large cities have problems with traffic. As the population in big cities is growing rapidly each year, it means that the number of cars that commutes on streets is also increasing. The growing number of cars on streets and highways will definitely cause traffic congestion and impact on the air quality as well. Secondly, it is a fact that in many big cities such as New York or Manila, the crime rate is considerably higher. Consequently, the local people do not feel safe when they walk in the park or in the subway station, as they could be robbed or injured anytime. Increasing living expenses, housing issues, and ever-increasing competition in workplaces are some other reasons for the degraded lifestyle in such big cities. The rapid growth of new supermalls, factories and offices in residential areas are also the reasons many people feel that the quality of life in big cities is decreasing.     
There are some solutions that governments and communities could consider to address the problem. One of them is that governments should provide decent and comfortable public transportation. By having a good public transportation system, it is hoped that people will choose to use public buses or trains rather than driving their own cars. As a result, it will reduce traffic congestion and air pollution. Another solution is that government should add more policemen and install more surveillance videos in areas with high crime activities. By having more policemen and video recorders, criminals will think twice before they do any crimes. Lastly, as existing big cities are overcrowded, governments should develop new residential and commercial areas. By having these new areas, it is hoped that some of the city people will move to new areas and reduce the density issue. Decentralisation of cities could be another effective solution to decrease the ever-increasing population in the cities. Finally, commercial areas should be kept far away from the residential areas and unplanned commercialisation in such areas should be prohibited.  
In conclusion, it is a fact that the quality of life in large cities is decreasing nowadays and it is mainly due to density, traffic, uncontrolled commercialisation and crime problems. However, there are some recommendations that governments could consider and apply. They should build a better public transportation system, add more security personnel and develop new areas. By doing these recommendations, it is hoped that the quality of life in big cities will get better. 
Essay 765:
In today's world competition among countries for hosting any international sporting event has increased. Many people believe that international sporting events cause many issues. However, I strongly disagree because it gives an opportunity to all nations to come together.
Firstly, organising any sporting event requires costly equipment, proper planning, manpower, arrangement, money and preparation. For instance, for arranging one cricket match panning, a stadium, schedule and other preparation are required. People also purchase costly tickets for watching the match. People who travel around the world for watching those matches require accommodation arrangement. This may cause unwanted expenses for countries who can host sporting events.
However, we cannot deny the importance of sports in our life. Any international sporting event like Olympic Games gives an opportunity to all participants to perform their best and make records. Sports lovers around the world definitely would get the best entertainment because of such events. Nowadays films, television serials are entertaining and popular among people. Likewise, sports are also equally important, entertaining and popular. From this, it becomes quite evident that such kind of events encourages young people in sports activities.
Furthermore, it gives an opportunity to all nations around the world to come together. For instance, in football world cup most of the countries can participate, which is very good for maintaining peace as well as maintaining good international relationship globally. This helps them to come closer to each other. This shows why sporting events have vast importance.
In conclusion, although arranging a sports event is expensive and causes some issues, it has a vast importance at the global level. For any sportsperson, it gives a chance not only to perform but also to entertain. Thus disadvantages of sporting events outweigh the advantages, and I believe that there are too many benefits because of such events.
Essay 767:
Undoubtedly, every year many humans' lives are jeopardised by the natural catastrophes. To protect them, individuals or organisations usually participate in assisting and sending aids to them. I firmly believe that the role of the administration is more than the other parts because of accessing to more equipment, networks and taxes.
The first reason why governments should cover citizens' basic needs during natural calamities is that they usually access to better facilities. Definitely, availability of more human resources, medications or transportation can assist the state authority to be able to save more injured people's lives. For example, during tsunami occurred in the South Asia in 2003, the local governments burdened the duty of saving many citizens from death, far greater than any private organisation. Had not they saved humans, its mortality rate would have increased fundamentally.
The second reason is that administrations have a better networking. This means, few hours after disasters, governments can immediately contact and report to the international organisations and ask monetary or non-monetary assistance from them; however, no any other private society or individual has this level of potential.
Lastly, the administration should spend the taxes paid by the on critical conditions. Clearly, only governments have a direct access to this financial resource, and this money should be considered for helping of dwellers hurt by calamities. This spending should cover food, shelter, medical expenses, house repairs, education or even paying temporary pensions.
In conclusion, citizens injured by calamities are better to be supported by their governments. I think they can have a better coverage due to accessing to more primary facilities, a better communication with worldwide organisations and tax resources.
Essay 768:
In today’s modern world, we are constantly bombarded with the issue of natural disasters happening around the globe. Thus, some people assert that preventing the occurrence of natural disasters is merely the responsibility of government as they believe they can do nothing in preventing it from happening. Nevertheless, I think that cooperation between people and government is essential in protecting citizens from natural disasters.
Undoubtedly, the government has the largest obligation to take the practical measures to prevent natural disasters from happening. They can, for example, employ the best scientists and geologists to predict the time of occurrence of disasters. By knowing when there will be a natural disaster, the government can then take the effective prevention to mitigate the potentially dangerous effects on human lives. To illustrate, to tackle the problem of the tsunami which may cause a severe death of inhabitants, the government should allocate a portion of the money to improve the current drainage system and to build barriers near the sea-coast. Thus, it is apparent that government has more power to lower the potential risks of natural disasters from happening and its effects on the citizens.
However, it is not to say that citizens have no responsibility to protect themselves from natural disasters. They can take little but could prove useful ways in dealing with this problem. For instance, parents should educate their children from young to behave well by not simply throwing rubbish into the drains and rivers which may eventually cause blockage. This kind of act is proved to be useful in preventing natural disasters like flooding. In addition, they should also take part in a campaign which gives information on what can be done by citizens in order to minimise the negative impacts of natural disasters on human beings. Although there are limited actions that an individual can take in dealing with this problem, the possible negative impacts on humans can still be reduced if every citizen plays their own part.
In conclusion, it is the responsibility of both government and individuals to mitigate the unanticipated impacts of natural disasters on human beings. I believe our nation will continue to prosper and flourish in the years to come and the citizens can be free from disasters.
Essay 770:
Tourism is a major driver for the economies of several countries, for instance, Sri Lanka, Mauritius, The Bahamas, etc. People come to these countries for a vacation and also to learn about the country’s culture by visiting national monuments, art galleries, museums, etc. Thus the question arises, should the entry to art galleries and museums be free?
Art galleries and museums can serve as a source of income to the government or the organisation owning it. Also, these structures need regular maintenance to keep them up to date and without a fee, it can become difficult to arrange required money to maintain them. In addition to this, if the art gallery or museum becomes a success, the revenue emanating from it can not only be used to expand existing infrastructure but also build new such structures.
However, apart from tourists, the local public should also be taken into account. The local people may not be able to afford the entry fee, especially those of a developing country and thus may miss out on important information about their motherland. A youngster missing out, on such information may be found wanting during discussions on the culture of his homeland when he visits foreign countries for study or work. Moreover, with people tending to adopt foreign culture easily these days, it is critical that the home culture is infused in them to preserve the integrity and originality of a nation. All of these can be encouraged by making entry to museums and art galleries free to local people. Apart from this, for students, it becomes easy to relate to the characters and events in their history books when they see them portrayed in the gallery or museum. Schools can organise free trips as part of learning series to these places.
In conclusion, I strongly feel that the entry to museums and art galleries should be free as they are an important part of a country’s culture. The maintenance of these structures can be sponsored through individual donations or government support.
Essay 771:
The issue of whether all museums and art galleries should be free to the public is of great interest to the public. Since they play a key role of countries’ culture, museums and galleries are widely regarded by people as free places. While some people think that it would be a waste of money and the government should pay the money to other important facilities. To my point of view, these museums should be free to us.
Admittedly, not every person is interested in museums or art galleries and the government should spend the money on public facilities which most of the people can make use of them, for instance, the public transport, roads, parks, .etc. As the tax is from people’ effort, they should spend on most people’s requirement.
Nevertheless, museums and art galleries play an important role in building up a country’s culture and it’s a key sign of modern developed society.  Since these art products are from people’s daily life which we didn’t realise but more than daily business, they sometimes show some higher level ideas. For instance what’s people’s real dreams inside the heart, what’s beauty and dirty. The most important reason that we visit the museums and enjoy the art product is that we need these positive elements. People need positive courage to strongly face the problems in life or need further suggestion to make their dream come true and sometimes the successful art can make it. When we fully understand the important role of art in museums or galleries, we would not regard them as wasting time or money.
In conclusion, museums and art galleries make a contribution to a better society because they provide a wide variety of good art which would make a great effect on people’s work and life, so they should be free to the public.
Essay 772:
In today’s modern world, one of the most controversial issues relates to whether the museums and art galleries around the globe should be made free to the tourists or not due to the reason that they play an indispensable role to educate the public about the cultures and traditions of a country. Personally, I strongly agree that all museums and art galleries should be made free access to the public.
There are a couple of reasons why the museums and art galleries should be made free. To begin, free admission fees will definitely be able to attract more tourists to visit. It is important to ensure that the cultures of a nation can be well-spread and known by both the local tourists as well as the foreigners. It is, indirectly, opening up an avenue to widen their horizons so that they can become more knowledgeable who can contribute endlessly to the society. It will also help them to reduce the experience of culture shock when they arrive in a new place in the future.
The factor which supports the view of making all the museums and art galleries free access to the tourists is that they may soon become one of the famous tourist attractions in their countries which are effective in promoting the traditions of the locals. With free access to the museums and art galleries, the locals and foreign tourists can visit them at no cost and it is proven to be one of the successful methods to attract those backpackers and low expenditure tourists to visit. Undoubtedly, they will be able to acquire knowledge about the history of a country and also the cultures of the local people which will make their travelling more meaningful. In addition, sooner or later, they will learn how to respect others cultures which may be slightly or totally different from theirs and become more open-minded.
In conclusion, I think all the museums and art galleries should be free in order to spread the cultures of a particular country effectively to all over the world. I believe every individual will no longer experience any culture shock once these places are free to access by everyone when they arrive in a new place.
Essay 773:
There are many cultures and traditions in this world and people believe and respect them from them from various points of views. While considering about a culture in a country, we cannot even forget its museums and art galleries as it plays a great role in preserving the culture. Moreover, they are the best method of displaying the history and values to the youth in a country. Therefore most probably this is a better idea of giving free entrance to them for people.
Firstly, museum and art galleries are doing a great job in protecting the value of the history of a culture. Furthermore, they have all the relevant things such as artefact, statues etc. which are important to be kept with it for saving. As an example, in many countries, there is even one museum or art gallery which keep valuable historical things in it which otherwise might have been lost.
Secondly, displaying of the things which give memorable and valuable feeling to people is also an important role of museums and art galleries. Moreover, people can visit there and see for their past lives of ancestors and how the society has developed up to now. For instance, we can see most of the displays illustrates the ancient stories.
To sum up, by looking at the major roles of museums and art galleries, which are preserving and displaying of historical values to the future world, I totally agree for giving the free visits to everyone as it helps to protect the heritage of a countries society.
Essay 774:
It is believed that the popularity of cinema theatre is gradually decreasing these days since people will change their interest to other platforms of entertainment. I personally disagree with the statement as there are many people who still love going to the cinema, and the following essay will discuss it in details.
On the one hand, it is true that with the rapid development of information technology, people could select various kinds of movie entertainments these days, besides going to the cinema. Some people prefer to purchase or rent the DVD and watch it at home since it is cheaper than going to the cinema. And then, with the existence of internet technology, people could just easily download the film and watch it on their computer. Therefore, a group of people have estimated that the era of cinema theatre will be finished in the next few years.
Despite the various offer from other entertainment platforms, it is fascinating to see the number of people who watch films at the cinema have not dropped until today. Many people still choose to watch recommended films at the cinema, since they feel that the experience and the excitement are totally different than at home. The advanced digital effects and the surrounding sound system do affect to the atmosphere and the attraction of the film which satisfy the viewers. And then several people choose to watch movies at the cinema due to they could concentrate more on than at home. They feel that there are many distractions when they watch films at home. For instance, the annoying noise of their little children or pets. As a consequence, cinemas still become one of the favourite entertainment places.
In conclusion, some people believe that cinema’s popularity seems to decrease as people choose to see films through other platforms. Although it is true that there are various types of devices which can be used for watching films such as video recorder or DVD player, I personally believe that the number of people who go to cinemas will not decrease, as the sensation and the excitement of watching films in theatres are totally different.
Essay 775:
In the 21st century, cinemas have become ubiquitous. However, being widespread movie theatres aren't able to lure people to spend their leisure time. It is agreed that gradually the number of people turn up at theatres is going to decrease in view of current trends.  It is due to ticket prices that have skyrocketed over the last few years along with the advent of online movie rentals and download.
Firstly, the cost of tickets has surged in the last decade. For example, it is almost 10 times more that we are spending compared to 1990's. Unfortunately, this is something that has a negative impact which is difficult to encounter despite the advanced technology, better sitting and ease of booking. Thus, it makes it clear why the future of big screen is bleak.
Secondly, the introduction of online movie libraries for rentals as well as downloads at affordable prices. For instance, iTunes and Netflix have jumped into this area to offer customers economical options to buy or rent movies. It’s more appealing to stay in and watch something on a computer screen or tablet with no physical constraints. Therefore, it’s hard to imagine for people to show up at cinemas. The environment of the cinema halls and the quality of movies are also in question. Very few families nowadays go to cinema while this was a common trend even in later 90’s.
To summarise, it is the expensive tickets as well as the movie watching options on the internet that have led to the decline of people visiting cinemas to spend their free time. Thus, it is clear why the number of people going to watch a flick will eventually decrease further in years to come.
It is widely accepted that silver screen is the best way of entertaining people. While some people argue that the trend for going to cinema have decreased nowadays, some people are in the opinion that, still it is of interest to many more people who desire the mind relaxation through arts.
To begin, there is no denying the fact that time constraints encountered is a common issue for people today and these people do not have much spare time to spend on movies. Especially, because of the time lap, one will have to spend on watching cinema may be a bit of long. Due to the busy life schedules of people, they will not deserve to commit such a long time for entertainment and will opt for short time entertaining activities. On the other hand, just because of this competitive nature of people's lives, they will engage in more and more mind relaxation activities in order to reduce the stress level and go for a silver screen and watching a movie.
Secondly, with the development of technology, people all over the world enjoy latest technological equipment and innovative as well as newly featured home theatre systems lie on the top of the list. With the availability of such new, highly modified systems in hand, people tend to stay home and watch movies with their entire family. In this way, people will not have to spend time on travelling as well as they can enjoy more free postures while they are watching the movie in their own home. By opting to watch movies at home instead of going to the cinema, people can also find it flexible to watch it at their convenient. Although it is free and flexible to watch a movie at home, the feeling of a change will not be sensed by the mind as it happens while watching a movie in the cinema. Therefore, some people still prefer to experience the change that can have while they are sitting in the cinema with their loved ones.
To sum up, it is acceptable that people tend to be away from the silver screen due to numerous circumstances. Yet, I believe, there are some good reasons that the era of the silver screen will not come to an end although there are reductions in the number of people who will go for it and hence disagree with the statement.
Cinema was really popular amongst people in old days and still is, however, many believe that the age of silver screen is going to be over soon as more and more people become less interested in visiting cinema just to watch a movie. In my opinion, I believe they will never go out of fashion or forgotten.
The first point to consider is why some people would think that cinema is losing its popularity. One reason is that, nowadays, almost all the families have televisions in their home and they would want to see a movie in the conform of their home rather than going all the way to a multiplex. For instance, these days, it's easy to switch on TV and look for a movie you like and watch it laying on the couch. Likewise, many companies provide online video watching services and people are able to buy movies directly from the internet and watch it later anytime. For example, Netflix offers monthly subscriptions for their large online movie and TV series database making any program just a click away.
Nevertheless, there are two main reasons why silver screen will never become obsolete. First is that the feeling of watching movie on televisions or online will never surpass the instant gratification and thrills of watching in a theatre, because the screens in theatre are a lot bigger compared to a computer monitor or television screen and the sound systems, such as that of an IMAX theatre, is far better than home theatre system. It can be also observed that 4D movie watching is becoming a trend in the modern society and it is making cinema popular, especially for children. It is not easy to experience 4D at home as the equipment are expensive and not easy to set up.
Cinema is the entertainment mode for many people. It is the most affordable recreational activity which comes in handy for all kinds of people. If we see the development in the field of cinema, there has been a tremendous development in the field of the silver screen. In the past, cinema houses were limited but people used to go to cinema houses due to the inadequacy of entertainment media in houses.
As the technology developed, the technical advancements in the field of home entertainment made entertainment more affordable .This affordability made all to have their own entertainment systems. This change led to the downing trend of the people’s interest to the cinema houses. Eventually, after a certain period in the future, people might not be coming to the silver screen houses rather they would be liking to sit at home and enjoy.
If we see the recent number of people attending to a cinema house, we have to agree to the fact that there has been a considerable drop in the number of people attending cinema houses. As far as my opinion is concerned, the euphoria of the silver screen is diminishing and it would not be surprised to note that people in future do not go to cinema house. If we consider an example of the cinema viewing experience, South India is a good example people used to see a movie in cinema hall and the released movie used to play in the allocated hall for at least 80 days but if we see the present situation a new movie in an allocated hall stays hardly for 2 to 4 weeks. There is a considerable drop in the viewing experience of people, the reason behind this is the availability of home entertainment, access to various other programs which are attractive than movies, piracy, change in lifestyle ,competitive world bulldozed by career goals. Not only this, few of the movies which are made now are not attractive in comparison with the movies of the earlier era, they do not possess entertainment values.
From the above, it can be adjudged that silver screen is definitely coming to extinction, maybe not in the near future but after a certain period of time, the cinema houses would stand as a monumental piece.
These days, the existence of cinemas is a hot topic of discussion for not only the journalist but also common folk. Many daily's features and public debates topic have been focusing this issue. Though millions support the opinion of the silver screen will exist in future, I strongly hold the view that the silver screen era will be taken its last breath soon.
One of the obvious reasons: advanced televisions and other electronic gadgets facilitate to watch all visual media programme, including films, from the home settings. These facilities cut down the number of cinema customers significantly. Moreover, cinemas mostly cost an arm and a leg for common folk. Televisions breach this barrier considerably. To cite an example, recent  UK statistical department study reveals that the ticket sale of the cinema has significantly declined on Sunday evening because of a popular television music show  aired the same time.
Another reason to support my view is that the live football, cricket and music concert attract massive public attention. They give a complete visual treat, which can not be offered by many cinemas. Furthermore, these kinds of live activities explore several avenues of entertainment than cinemas. Increasing the number of music and sports events is the best epitome for public acceptance.
However, an army of people argues that cinema world will not be lost because of the new talented artists will come to the silver screen soon. Perhaps it may be true to some degree, but we can not deny that the other medium of entertainment will also offer high quality of participants’ perfectionism.
Essay 776:
A government has many great responsibilities to its citizens and better health care for everyone is one of them. While free medical service is hard to maintain for a government with budget scarcity, it is a must to ensure a healthy nation. Some disadvantages are there but they can be controlled with strict laws and monitoring.
To begin with, medical services and treatments are quite expensive and the majority of the people, even in a rich nation, can not afford it. This is why the government has to intervene and make the health care affordable for all and provide free services for poor citizens. It is natural that a great number of people avoid meeting doctors for minor diseases due to expensive medical services. Many of them end with major healthcare issues which could have been easily avoided if they were diagnosed at the initial level. In fact, the ratio of such diseases is quite high - according to a Health Care Review Committee Report published recently. Moreover, epidemic diseases are often spread among the destitute population and then affect the whole nation. If those poor citizens are out of proper medical treatment, this is a concern for the whole nations.
Among downsides, free medical services often lack the quality and have fewer doctors, nurses and medical instruments. This makes the diagnosis of a disease harder and people often get poor services from such a free camp. They have to wait for a long and this is detrimental for patients who need emergency medical attention. Furthermore, the corruption often drains a large amount of money and adds burden to the government. However, these can all be controlled if proper measures are taken. In fact, the drawbacks of free public medical service are not good enough excuse to spot supporting it.
Healthy people build a healthy society and this is why it is a fundamental right for people. One should take care of one’s health but the people live below the poverty line cannot afford the expenses of medical checkups and to them, health care support must be provided by the state. However, there are certain drawbacks in providing free medical care.
To begin with, the state must provide free health care to take care of the citizens, especially who can not afford expensive private healthcare services. Someone suffering from any severe health problem will be able to be diagnosed at the right time and consequently, the disease can be treated properly. Finally, the vaccines given at these centres would protect babies from dangerous diseases. The government has a responsibility to ensure proper medical services to its citizens and free health care for all is the way to achieve it.
However, some people may consider these free health camps to be disadvantageous. It is certainly possible that the concerned corrupt authorities could misuse the funds allocated for free health service and offer poor medical treatment. As a result, the financial burden on a country rises. Moreover, some people may get habituated to visit a hospital for simple silly reasons and at times, one may overuse the free medicines available and get resist to that medicine which is very drastic.
These days due to the advancement in science and technology, someone is able to determine any health abnormality at the initial level himself. For instance, the Intent has a great source of advice, tips and treatment prescribed by professional doctors and researchers that ordinary people can access and follow anytime. From this regards, people should follow a healthy lifestyle and access these free resources for their health benefits without burdening the government for their minor health-related issues.
ree medical service supported by the state ensures quality treatment for all as it is free of cost. An affluent individual has a wider range of healthcare options than a lower income person. The government is meant to include all for the services it offers, not only a segment of the population.
 government has some big responsibilities to fulfil and ensuring free healthcare service for all is one of them. If a state makes education and treatment expensive and out of reach for ordinary population, a state is better without such authority! Two key areas governments focus their attention on is public health care and education. If these services are not accessible by all, there is no meaning of having a government in a country.
any people do not meet doctors and check their health condition as private medical facilities cost them a huge amount of money. The state-funded free medical support would encourage them to frequent those facilities and control any diseases from the initial stage.
rivate hospitals and medical facilities spend very little on research and the responsibility of a government to use the public funds for research to invent cures for deadly diseases cannot be overlooked.
ometimes prevention is better than cure and the government can educate the mass population about the necessity of leading a healthy life only if it reaches to the mass people through free healthcare services.
ree health care service includes only some basic treatment and for advanced diagnosis, people have to turn to the more expensive private medical treatment. Free healthcare usually covers only the most common treatment and the lack of doctors and trained nurses make it worse.
n a free health care centre, patients often have to wait for a long for the treatment and prescribed surgery. Moreover, when a patient is given a date, it will be one that satisfies the hospital, not the patient.
he free health care centres do not have the latest medical equipment and they use old technologies to treat and diagnosis a patient. This is not the best way to serve a patient. A single doctor has to meet and take care of a large number of patients and this is detrimental for patients with the severe condition.
Essay 777:
Discrimination between the man and the woman is a burning issue to discuss. The roles of men and women have changed in the society than it was 20 years ago and this change is faster these days. With the advancement of time, now women are dominant in different roles while men are suffering the sexual disparities. I agree with the statement and the reasons behind the agreement are as followed.
Earlier, before 2000, women were subject to be dominated everywhere. They had the typical roles to care for the home. But after the millennium, a sudden change took place everywhere. The majority of the women became aware of their rights, responsibilities and changed their roles. The woman who used to be escorted by family members is now free to move anywhere, runs her own business, makes deals perfectly, and leads her own life. Undoubtedly this is a positive change in their roles. But with that, a growing number of women are now denying their responsibility for their family and men are helpless in this regards.  
The positive changes have made women independent and are prioritised in all sectors of development, economy, education, healthcare, jobs etc. But unfortunately, they are replacing the roles of men. They are occupying the positions of men and dominating the world. As a result, now males are turning subject to sexual discrimination as the women experienced in yester decades. The hanged scenarios led males to be less prioritised in different sectors, especially the most important sector - employment. The discrimination is visible when a university decides the reserve 50% seats for the women or the local parliament have a certain percentage of seats reserved for the women. I had such a real-life experience in last month. I went for an interview with a multinational corporation against the position of Junior executive. I was surprised that the corporation decided to recruit females more in number than males in that position. We were only three male applicants competing for a single post while there were 15 women against 10 chairs of junior executives.
Essay 778:
How the youths should spend their time is a great concern for many. Some are more involved in cultural activities than sports, while others prefer sports over the cultural activities. No doubt cultural activities are important, but in my opinion, sports are more important and that is why I partially disagree with this statement.
Undoubtedly there are necessities of cultural activities to get entertained or learn different cultural aspects. It improves mental faculty and refreshes the mind. It also helps to nurture the culture and learn the customs. Besides, performing in theatres or enjoying them develops a deeper sense of the world and life. But at the same time if we ignore the necessity of physical activities, for sure we are to experience a massive health disaster in near future.
Not to mention, the youths need to have some physical activities to keep a good health. Health is wealth. So, unless they are healthy enough, they would be unable to enjoy other activities. For instance, sports help to keep people fit. Participation in sports makes them healthy in terms of physical aspects. Consequently, when they would be healthy, they could participate in many other activities spontaneously. But the lack of physical activity or lack of participation in sports may bring health disorders among them.
Having said that, we all know that the majority of the diseases today appear due to our less involvement in outdoor activity and sedentary lifestyle. The more people are inactive, the more they are prone to diseases like heart disorders, diabetes, obesity, mental depression, frustration etc. Usually, doctors suggest to take regular physical exercise to improve the physical fitness and it helps to keep them cheerful.
All things considered, the youths should participate in sports in line with the participation in cultural activities. I am sure that nobody will prefer to listen to music or enjoy theatrical performances with a massive disorder in their heart which has been developed for physical inactivity. I believe it is imperative to the youths to allocate their time primarily to sports and then for the cultural activities.
Some people think that youths should spend more time on cultural activities such as music and theatre and their participation in sports should be reduced. This essay will describe the importance of sports that must be taken into account for the youngster and disagrees with the view.
Sports help young people to be fit both physically and psychologically. Exercise is an inevitable part of our lives and the sport is a better method of exercise than any other activity. For having a healthy society, we have to encourage young people to play outdoor games even more than they do these days. A young generation who actively participates in spots have fewer diseases and cut the government's healthcare budget. For instance, nations with healthy citizens are more successful in developing their economy, according to a report published by the Global Healthcare Research Centre. So, encouraging young people to spend more time on sports will help us build a better world.
The next importance for youth to play sports is to learn teamwork. What is the better place for adolescents to learn to coordinate with other teammates than in a sports field? As a team member, a child learns to interact with others and work for a common goal. This experience will help them to reach their aim in life. Finally, it opens the potential of becoming a successful sportsman. The youngster who is playing football today could be the next Christiano Ronaldo or David Beckham.
Essay 779:
When it is about the recruitment of any top-level executive at a company, their salaries become higher than the average. Besides, a company usually pay a large percentage of their salary only to a handful of top level employees. It happens as individuals holding those posts have to take great responsibilities, make big decisions, possess their unique ways to generate incredible profit for the company they are working for and so on. I think that they deserve a high payment for their unparalleled contributions to the company.
It may sound weird that a top official should get a large payment than the ordinary employees but the answer is critical. Generally, the ordinary employees work hard for hours and invest their manual labour to increase the production level. Certainly, their labour counts for the company's growth but at the end of the day, the decision made by the higher executives determines the fate of the company.
On the other side, the job of a top official is mostly invisible to the ordinary workers. The job responsibilities of a top executive may range from controlling the quality of production to dealing with the prestigious clients, setting up the marketing strategy for survival in competition, planning for future product development, analysing the consumers’ needs, inventing newer products, making future plans, hiring and firing employees, tackling the market inflation and more. Actually, bearing such responsibilities is not an easy task indeed. When an ordinary employee's responsibility ends when the clock ticks to 5, there is no schedule for a top level employee.  
Moreover, if any of the steps turn into a failure, the top executive is to be liable, and so, he has to set some other strategies to overcome such unwanted situations. But expecting such fine-tuned results from the ordinary employees is impossible. They are only trained to complete the production in time. If they are assigned with strategic roles, the entire company will collapse within a short span of time. They lack the experience, skills and foreseeing capacities like the top executives.  
All things considered, I think hiring top executives with a larger salary is truly justified. They invest their labour, time and skills to improve the company's condition and remain behind the screen. In fact, without top level employee's  strategy or effective planning, it is not possible for any company to sustain in the competitive market.
Essay 780:
There has been a dramatic increase in the numbers of newspaper and television channel over the last few years. Despite this increasing numbers, a large proportion of the population, which consist of youngsters seem uninteresting to pursue news on print and electronic media. Timings, traditional and boring way of presenting information and new interests among young are few factors that impede the youngster attention towards reading or watching the news. However, there is a dire need to adapt new technologies to cater youngster interest. For instance, the online version of the news, easy accessibility and encouragement from guardians can help a lot in this regard.
Firstly, newspaper always comes in the morning, which is the busiest time of youngsters, as they are approaching schools and colleges at that time. Secondly, nowadays mass media is full of boring and traditional news, having nothing new for the youngster that can attract their attention. Thirdly, study loads and pressure of completing assignments, projects and research work are the main hindrances to following news on media. Apart from that, youngsters spend more time on social networking sites and that’s why they have less interest in traditional newspapers or news channels.  
However, media could appeal numerous youngsters by providing them online news and video streaming by the use of technology that will be more convenient and easily accessible for them. Additionally, interaction by the forum, chats and comments also play a pivotal role in pulling target audience. Moreover, youngsters should have access to newspapers on bus stops, stations and waiting for areas of institutions.
To sum up, I would like to say that new and innovative ways of information dissemination with the use of technological advancements would definitely influence youngsters. Accessibility of resources and guidance from the parents could also be fruitful.
Essay 781:
Impacts and costs of international sporting events are quite controversial in the present time. Some of the schools are focusing on the benefits of holding international sports events while the opposite school is on the view that this is a waste of time, funds and effort. This essay delves with the viewpoint before it closes the argument.
Firstly, international sporting events help to build some special relations between the hostile countries. For instance, the relationship between India and Pakistan is not so friendly and they have disputes on many issues. But the disputes are overlooked on the playground. When the teams participate in cricket, the relationships among the players are not hostile. They are cooperative and exercise the best friendly attitude with each other. If it continues, it is expected that the cold relations between the two countries will turn warmer someday. Moreover, such events bring foreign revenue, inspire sports lover to take part in outdoor games and promote a healthy lifestyle.
But on the contrary, the disadvantages are also acknowledgeable. When an international and exciting sports competition is arranged, people want to watch those events – some prefer to watch live in the playground while many like to watch on television sitting at home. To enjoy a high voltage cricket match or exciting Olympic events, people need to waste their valuable times both day and night. A hardcore cricket fan may bunk office, school or may make late-rising early next morning for sleeping late at night. Thereby, in a greater consideration, this is a waste of time, effort and money for the ordinary people. On top of that, hosting those events requires a huge sum of money and efforts.
To finish the argument, I would like to say that, though arranging big events is costly, they have many advantages. They promote friendly relationship, entertain people, promote tourism and inspire young people to participate more in sports. This is why I disagree with the view that big sporting events are an enormous waste of fund, time and effort.
During the preceding decades, World Cup and Olympic tournaments have gained immense attention due to its vital effect on our society. But debates have emerged about their importance and whether they are worthy of the tremendous amount of money that is poured to organize them. However, I have a firm conviction that such events are completely beneficial for us from the social, financial, and political scale. Besides, I agree that they deserve every penny, minute and work that is exerted.
Firstly, sports competitions, especially at the global level, have benefits. As they nurture the ambition of success in youths’ mind which encourages them to do their best in training and preparation for such games, they motivate millions of young minds. In consequence, juveniles focus on participating in athletics, and that tackles the invasion of drugs in our communities to a great extent.
Moreover, it helps improve the national income besides providing more job opportunities even before or after the event. For example, the Brazilian economy has been flourishing after holding the world cup and the Olympic Games in 2014 and 2016, respectively.
Besides, a positive impact of global tournaments, on international peace, was significantly observed in many situations. In such games, all players gather to share their passion for sports, despite the relations between their countries. For instance, in Athens 2004 Olympic games, South and North Korea participated as a country which was a good step towards achieving peace between them.
Essay 782:
The present age is fast paced and marked with the advancement of science and technology. As a result, we are turning into machines than human and that is resulting in a limited relationship even with the next door neighbours. Now, the relationship among neighbours is dismal than the past. This essay delves into the reasons for this distant relationship among neighbours and some ways to improve it.
First of all, people, these days, lack their leisure hours. They are unable to arrange times for socialising. In fact, they are to follow the strict routines, execute respective occupational duties, and if someone fails, survival turns challenging for them. So, people cannot manage extra hours to spent with neighbours. As a result relationship among people declines.
On contrary, often people do lack the sense of consideration. They seem to have less care for others. For instance, I have a neighbour in my next flat who is a singer and work at a local band. So, when he starts practising in the middle of the night, it is really irritating for me. I have notified the issue several times to him but that was of no use. So, I decided not to socialise with him anymore as his irrational behave developed an unpleasant feeling inside me about him. The similar scenarios are found randomly that is resulting in relationship decline.
Actually, there are no specific ways to improve the relationship with neighbours. I believe the application of common sense is enough towards a healthy relationship with neighbours. The most important matter about this – each of the people should be aware of their rights and responsibilities, and limitations. For instance, I am not responsible for caring for my neighbour’s dog on my lawn or home. Similarly, the neighbours should also be aware of such issues so that any of their attitudes or activities cause trouble for others. when everyone will be aware of the issue, I think the relationship will come to a pleasant level.
Essay 783:
A country is known by its subjects, the people who reside in that country. There are, of course, other parameters as well, like the economy of the country, the Gross Domestic Product, the average income earned per person, to name a few. However, these other parameters ultimately are dependent on the available resources with such country. There are countries on this globe which have a handful of resources, but a judicious approach in utilising and exploiting these limited resources makes a country being either looked upon or looked down or even ignored in certain cases. Due to this, one of the many factors, the government of a country must try to divert its resources (read monetary resources) towards building a healthy nation by investing and nurturing the health of its inhabitants.
There are two schools of thoughts whose views vary from one another. One of the schools is of the view that the available monetary resources must be diverted towards enhancing the skills of a few of the top athletes, which the country adorns. The view of the other school, however, is skewed on the other side which believes that the financial resources, at the disposal of a country, must be directed towards making available better facilities to the general public, at large. According to the other school, the impetus must be towards extending benefits to a large base of the population rather than restricting the flow of benefit to a privileged class.
Though the importance of exploiting the talent of top athletes, who are few in numbers, cannot be ignored, as they do bring the charm, glory, laurel and fame to their parent country by winning sports competition, albeit, at the cost of public, at large. As a matter of fact, the opinion of one of the schools of thoughts was vouched for, in one of the articles of the weekly magazine, The XAW. The magazine depicted the amount spent for promoting sports by investing the taxpayer's money, on a few top sports person. The data clearly revealed and drew a picture that clearly did show the exorbitant amount so spent. It can be safely said that these are not mere speculations of an armchair dreamer but are the bare truth revealed by the statistics.
Thus, it can be candidly and, with evidence, concluded that the government must divert their economic resources towards providing general facilities, which are mandatory, to the population, which has a large base, rather than investing money on a few top athletes. It, however, does not diminish the value of sports because sports is one of the activities which provide health to anyone who pursues it and of course health, for everyone is dearer than the fine opals, more precious than the emeralds!
The first opinion of the debate is to spending money on providing facilities for the commoners by the government while the second one argues that the investment should be for the top athletes only. This is a well-debated topic and deserves some attentions. In my opinion both the schools are correct in some senses and they have some reasons to believe so.
Firstly, it should be considered that the number of ordinary people is considerably higher than the top athletes. So, they are in need of some sports facilities where they could have the chance of physical activities. In fact, we all are aware of the importance of physical activities and how they benefit us all. In my locality, there are no public parks available where the people can take some exercises in morning or evening hours. So, the number of patients with physical disorders like diabetes, obesity, heart disease etc. is on the rise in my locality here in Jakarta and the issue got covered on the local dailies as well. The government in a county should be more focused on improving the public health than winning some trophies.
On the contrary, top athletes are assets for a nation. Their failure in any competition is the disgrace for the entire state. Unless they are trained in a perfect manner, they would be unable to participate in major competitions and bring the desired fame for the country. So, a proper training is a must for them. It would really be a humiliation when media will cover stories over their failures in international sporting events and if that happens for lack of government appreciation.
Therefore, considering both the arguments, I think the government should make a balance between the two. Usually, physical activities make people fit and help to be an effective workforce. So, if the mass people turn physically inactive, an economic disaster is a must. Further, if the top athletes are ignored, it will be a disgrace for the nation. Hence, the I believe the government should pay attention in both the case equally.
Essay 784:
Education is the backbone of a nation and the true development of a nation relies on the way our children are being educated. Though homeschooling was quite a remarkable idea in the past, this, is in my opinion, is no longer applicable and suitable in the modern society.
First of all, the concept of ‘self-educated’ is not acceptable in any job sector and without the certification from college or university level, someone can’t even apply for a post. Thus homeschooling will only increase the unemployment in the society while it was an excellent way of educating people in the last century. Moreover, parents these days send their children to the daycare centre from the very early stage and thus they have no time for homeschooling in a sense.
Second, the education system in the past was not as formal as it is today. Thus having home tutors and mentors at home by rich people to educate their children was probably the best arrangement. On the contrary, poor could not afford tutors and thus engaged their children in some sort of works from their childhood. The picture has changed and the modern government system allows poor and rich students alike to study in a school which is subsidised by government funds in many cases.  
Finally, homeschooling is no longer the norm in education these days. We have formal educational institutes that employ best teachers for every subject and follow a national and international course curriculum.  Without attending formal educational institutes, the students would not be treated as educated in the country, job sector, and even in the society.
In conclusion, parents should help their children on their studies at home so that they can excel in school. The school is the main standard of education these days while homeschooling has become an obsolete idea while it has been a successful system in the pre-modern era.
Essay 786:
The invention of the camera was one of the greatest findings of all time. For the last two decades, photos and videos have become an integral part of the human culture. Needless to say, the camera has changed the way of celebration and the perception of a normal person. Nowadays there is rarely any occasion which is not being captured by a camera or video recorder. Also, the ways important events are being telecasted have changed a lot.
Firstly, the camera has opened up avenues for keeping our memorable events intact throughout our life span. These still images and videos captured by the camera can later be used to cherish those moments of happiness. Take the first rice ceremony of a newly born child, for instance. When this child grows up, he can feel his parent's exact feeling, through the video captured at the time of the event. Thus, it is quite evident that the camera has changed the way of celebration of our memorable occasions.
Moreover, the camera has also changed the way we look at the world. For example, in the non-camera era, it was impossible for any individual to view the live telecast of the very important "rail budget" being organised at the parliament. The introduction of the camera has made this possible. Now sitting at any corner of the world, a person can watch the live streaming of any important event being organised somewhere else. Looking at this illustration, it can be easily seen how the camera has changed the way we look at the world.
After analysing the above points, we can safely conclude that the introduction of the camera is indeed one among the very few live changing inventions. It has changed our perception towards the world along with the way of celebration. It is also expected that in the foreseeable future the usage of the camera will even grow higher.
Nowadays, visual systems have revolutionised humans’ lives. People of the world have a better view of their surroundings by using a camera. I personally believe that recording of live events, using of visual effects in movies and availability to more equipped cameras in news are three important reasons behind it.
Obviously, recording of live national celebrations and satellite TV programmes, producers these days are able to broadcast different nations’ cultures to the world. For instance, the U.S. Citizens have become familiar with Asians’ cultures far easier due to accessing better to the live events shown on Satellite or the Internet. However, in the past, they only had to find them in magazines, newspapers or sometimes local flyers.
The second reason behind it is that watching movies, people can recognise better other lifestyles. Definitely, since the introduction of the camera, western culture has become more understandable to other nations because they are always exposed to visual scenes related to western countries, shown on television. As a prime example, Jeans, a very popular fashion in the U.S.A., became a common type of wearing as they were shown in western movies, and now even in very remote areas of Africa people used to use these clothes.
Lastly, we can see viewers have deeper concepts to the reports broadcasted on the media. Had not the camera been invented, individuals would not have accessed to such high qualities of these visual scenes, while now they can immediately watch live news, including other countries’ festivals, national celebrations or worldwide sports championships. For example, I became familiar with the Chinese’s festivals shown on BBC news. Watching it led me to know more about these people’s habits, food or their ceremonies.
In conclusion, by using the camera, more details of humans’ lives have been figured out. I give a green light to this device because it has been extremely influential not only in the movie but in news or other live programs shown on TV.
Essay 788:
Social status, wealth and material possession have turned into the indicators to judge someone in the society these days while traditions, good quality and honour are no longer valued, though they are the de facto to judge a person. I agree that modern world has a completely different set of criteria for assessing or honouring a member of the society, though they are not the real elements to define a person.  
Earlier, societies had some specific indicators to judge a man or woman. Among the judging indicators, they preferred qualities like honesty, kindness, trusts, honour etc. But with the change of time, such pointers have vanished. Unluckily the present society prefers social status or riches to judge anyone. A real-life experience may make it simpler. Recently, I closely observed a local election in a distant part of India. Among the two candidates – one of them came from a high profile background while the other one was a shabby man who merely had his own permanent living space in the locality. The majority of the people supported the first individual. They took him granted as a gentleman as he is enriched with material possessions. On the contrary, only a few people supported the poor guy. He was unable to spend bucks for the election but was competing on some moral grounds. He dreamt of changing the society. Unluckily he was defeated by the wealthy candidate. The rich man did not allow his opposition to be an obstacle to his success.
This triumph and defeat made me realise that material possessions are the key to judging as important in society. When people have enough riches to spend, they can buy social status and supports. But unfortunately, when someone comes up with humanitarian features, social elites term them as old-fashioned. They are ignored.
Therefore, I think such ideas should be changed. We should appreciate the humane features than social status and material possessions. Otherwise, the consequences will be detrimental. When the social status will be the indicator to judge oneself, I believe that would be too humiliating and may lead to massive social disorder. 
Essay 789:
It is challenging indeed to get a reliable job as a fresher as the employers, in most of the cases, pick the employees who have a past history of work in reputed organisations and have relevant work experience. But this trend should be changed. I support that the government should inspire employers to pick youths in needs of new workers for the following reasons.
First of all, a large number of educated youths are unemployed in different parts of the world. For instance, in my land, Pakistan, the number of educated youths is not few. A substantial number of highly educated youths are seeking jobs but not getting as the employers prefer the expert hands. They do not rely upon the unskilled fresh graduates. If this trend continues, the rate of unemployment will go beyond control shortly.  
Moreover, unless the young people are getting involved with any sort of jobs or professions, they will not get their experience. So, at least to make them experienced in a particular field, the employers should pick them. Salary is not a fact for the fresh graduates, they are in need of a job to prove their skills and get some ideas on professional life. There were no jobs for a fresher like me in Pakistan a couple of years ago. When I completed my graduation from the University of Karachi, it was really difficult for me to find a job. Almost all the job advertisements required applicants having at least three years of professional experiences. If the authority fails to motivate companies to hire fresh graduates, many of them would become depressed and get involved in crimes.
To conclude the topic, I think it is only the government who can intervene here to change the situation. Still, a large number of educated youths are seeking jobs. The scenario is almost the same around the world. If the youths are ignored in the job market, their moral degradation is a matter of time only. The corporations should make a balance while recruiting.
Essay 790:
Often governments try to control the use of any specific language at different levels and it begins from schools. Basically, the government wants to underscore on state language other than anything. Such policies have some advantages and demerits too. A comparative discussion is done in the following paragraphs.
First of all, the government puts emphasis on the mother tongue of the state so that the kids could learn the state language effectively and communicate. As a result, the kids turn expert on national language. Further, as they are expert, communication is easier for them inside the national boundary. Actually, when kids are in schools and they are to learn several languages, it becomes difficult for them to cope with the words, dialects and other linguistic issues. Thereby, importance on certain language in school is reasonable. For instance, in most of the Asian countries, it is compulsory to study the mother tongue in elementary schools.
On the other hand, teaching a certain language may create a sense of excessive dependency on that specific language. As a result, it may hamper their communication skills in a different perspective. They will lose confidence to communicate in the international environment.
My 5-year old daughter, Samantha, is in her elementary school here in France. The school strictly forbids using English or any other language than French during the school hours. The intentions are respectable and kids are learning French perfectly. But at the same time, kids are losing their ability to communicate in English or in other international languages. Learning it in a later phase of life is less effective than learning at an early age, I think.
Finally, after the aforesaid arguments, I believe adoption of such policies is ineffective. The ratio of demerits is almost equal to its benefits. So, if we justify the needs, the outcomes will be under satisfactory level. In a true sense, there are no advantages of this initiative at all, mere a waste of time. Hence, governments should deeply investigate the matter to make the right choice.
Essay 791:
It is believed that there are other effective and efficient methods for anticipating crimes, besides prison. To a certain point, I would agree with the statement, but each people have their own different personalities. Some people could be developed through social and humanistic approaches, but there are others who can only be disciplined through imprisonment.
On the one hand, some people believe that the government should find other alternative ways in preventing crimes besides jail punishment. These people think that crimes could be prevented through humanistic approaches, such as giving campaigns and awareness of crimes through social media. And then the government could also prevent crimes through some holistic approaches, such as giving some religious seminars about the negative effect of crimes. These people believe that these humanistic methods are more effective in reducing the number of crimes than prison.
On the other hand, it is a fact that every criminal has his/her different personality as each of them came from different cultures and backgrounds. Some people have been raised in a tough neighbourhood such as being raised in a conflict area or living in a poor and slum suburb. As a result, these people are familiar with violence and crimes. Humanistic and social approaches could not be implemented for these people, and imprisonment would be the most effective methods for them.
In conclusion, it is said that there should be another way in preventing crimes besides prison. I personally believe that both methods should be combined. Governments should start with a more humanistic approach in preventing crimes by giving campaigns to their people. Once they found that the method is ineffective then they should change the method into warnings and fines. And if these methods still could not reduce the number of crimes, then governments should implement the imprisonment.
Essay 792:
An act is considered a crime if its nature deviates from the prevailing laws though there are different aspects and types of crimes, I would like to brief up crimes which result in imprisonment. A person is imprisoned so that the living society is not harmed by his acts and also a chance that the inmate gets corrected.
We see that prison certainly prevents crime but there are also certain better ways by which a person can be restrained from committing crimes. Firstly by maintaining a complete database of the doubtful citizens, this can be done by the police department because they possess the data of each and every individual and using this data his/her activities can be monitored and a close check can be kept on such suspicious persons. Secondly, counseling should be done to persons who are susceptible to commit crimes.
There are many ways to prevent crimes apart from the above stated and they would certainly control the crime rate and correct the anti-social elements prevailing in our societies, for instance, a person commits robbery due to the want of money and if the victim opposes, the robber tries to harm the victim and steals the valuables.
We see that general crimes are done due to hunger, want of money, poverty and unemployment. If the authorities have a check on the above-stated reasons and care is taken to check the situation of the person, no doubt then a majority of the crimes can be reduced.
Apart from the above, there are certain crimes which are done in haste, these types of crimes can be controlled by delivering psychological counselling to such people and diverting their minds by inducing them to various other recreational activities like meditation, yoga and spiritual thinking etc.
As far as my opinion is concerned it is good that a person should think twice before committing crime and such thoughts are to be inculcated into his mind and certainly there will be a drastic downfall in crime rate and subsequently reduction in state’s exchequer envisaged for handling prisons. But prisons are also necessary for handling heinous criminals and with prisons their effect on society can be controlled. There are many other ways to prevent crime but the need of such alternatives has to be debated on a broader scale before taking a decision.
Essay 793:
Young people are often considered over the old ones by most organisations. The percentage of people losing their jobs due to their age as they advance beyond 50 is alarmingly more in some countries. Such problems are a matter of great concern and must be addressed for a better economic state of a nation.
It is certainly true that these days due to the advancements in the field of science and technology, most of the employers opt the fresh graduates to employ. However, aged people obviously have guts and accomplishments to climb the ladder of corporate hierarchy. It is high time, one must think of the experience and the positive outlook the elder people have towards any aspect. Nevertheless, there are apparent ways to solve it.
To begin with, the main reasons could be the age factor, productivity, lowered work output, a way of thinking and mostly people over the age of 50 are usually Luddites. Today, all tasks primarily are being accomplished by using technology. Moreover, as the aged person generally may not be tech-savvy, this might be one possible reason for not recruiting them in good jobs. Furthermore, as a person becomes old, one would suffer from health implications which hinder the productivity at workplace. Nevertheless, it is undeniable fact that, some older people willingly do not want to work; they might want to spend their rest of the retired life with their children and grandchildren. Taking into considerations all the points it is clear why people over the age of 50 generally are not recruited in good jobs despite their experience.
On the other hand, according to me, how much ever the technology develops, experience always stands ahead of the knowledge of novices. Hence, certain measures should be taken to address this moot issue. What I suggest is that the government can pay a crucial role by allotting employment allowances to the elder people. Next, the corporate companies perhaps, think to form an expert team comprising of aged people who could guide the younger employees to ensure the success of an organisation.
To summarise, I believe that, there are several reasons behind this controversial issue and the possible consequences, but, by excluding these, the elder people should be given respect and a chance to prove their talent and experience.
Essay 794:
Nowadays, it is a ubiquitous notion that manifold animals are being utilised in the bulk of circuses and other entertainment centres. Fortunately, in some countries, there are stringent rules about prohibiting such kind of activities. In this essay, I will accentuate several significant points and give my personal stance on issue.
Essay 795:
Skill in a foreign language is really handy and if it is initiated from an early age, according to some language experts, it would be more effective than any other methods. I agree that a foreign language should be made mandatory for primary schools for the reasons below.
First of all, childhood learning lasts longer. Children are naturally quick learners. So, when they are engaged in to learn something newer, they turn wondering and consequently come to know about everything. The fact is similar to children in primary schools. When they will learn a new language in class, the language will offer an insight to them which makes them curious to know more about the people of other cultures or using that language. It creates a scope to explore the world which finally helps them to widen their knowledge.  
Secondly, learning at a mature age is difficult. Usually, adults experience numerous obstacles while learning like they lack time, subjects appear difficult etc. So, learning turns ineffective and if it is a foreign language, the troubles rise more. My son, a primary grade student, was curious about Spanish. He had a course titled ‘How to learn Spanish’ in his school. So, he wanted to know more about people and culture of Spain and often tried to speak Spanish. But it was impossible for me to communicate in Spanish with him and thus I arranged some reading materials. He appeared on oral Spanish tests and did very well, and turned into a fluent Spanish speaker. But I am unable in my thirties to learn or speak a foreign language like my eight-year-old child.
So, to conclude, I think if a foreign language learning is made compulsory in primary schools, it would help the kids to develop a standard communication skill, understanding of other culture and people; which in turn, will be quite effective in next phases of their lives.
Essay 796:
Nowadays, foreign-made programs take their dominance in most countries, if not all. Undoubtedly, those programs bring about many negative effects. Chiefs among them are the adoption of bad habits and watching-addiction.  For several reasons, I agree that the imported entertainment negatively affects the cultures of countries.
The first harm caused by imported foreign programs is the adoption of bad habits. In fact, foreign-made programs plant bad habits in their watchers which will be negatively reflected in their culture.  For example, my neighbour is so obsessed with watching foreign- programs and he and he always intends to imitate and adopt such bad habits. As a result, he began to drink Alcohol and use drugs.  Consequently, he caused many problems to his family in particular, and to his neighbours in general. This clearly shows us the danger the foreign programs may have on a community.
A second harmful effect of foreign-made programs is that they cause watching -addiction. In fact, many people, especially youth, are addicted to those programs. For example, my brother was a student who used to watch foreign- made programs every time and they left negative impacts on him. As a result, he became careless and indifferent to his studies to the point that he failed 3 exams.  Consequently, he was dismissed from the university and is now jobless.  So, it can be inferred that such programs have no benefits but serious effects.
To conclude, foreign –made programs are harmful to any community since they cause watching –addiction and bad habits adoption. To avoid above harms, governments are required to band foreign-made programs and replace them with local ones.
Essay 798:
Since the very beginning of the human civilisation, the creatures which lack in intelligence and power are being dominated by their counterparts. Apparently, since ages, human beings have been hunting animals and this trend has not stopped till date. Although contested by many, it is argued that the hunting should be banned with an immediate effect. The hunting is considered both as immoral and unethical practice. Hunting not only makes few species extinct but also affects the dairy industry of the country.
Firstly, there are a few species which are already very limited in numbers. Thus, hunting such animals will make them extinct. Take tigers, for example. A survey conducted by the forest department of India shows that currently there are only 2000 odd tigers left in India, compared to 3500 odd in 2014. This exponentially decreasing count of tigers clearly shows that if hunting is not stopped, our next generation might just be left with only images of tigers.
Moreover, the Indian economy is highly dependent on the dairy industry. Thus, any impact on this industry will directly affect the economy of the country. Indubitably, the act of hunting is doing no good for the dairy industry. For example, if the count of the milk producing cattle is decreased, automatically the production of dairy products would also be reduced. Thus, it is quite evident how a ban on hunting would catalyse the dairy industry, and in turn, the Indian economy.
After analysing the above points, we can safely conclude that although, since ages human beings have kept themselves engaged in the act of hunting, the same has numerous detrimental effects as well. In order to effectively address those issues, the hunting should be stopped immediately. It is also believed that considering the negative impact of hunting, in the foreseeable future, individuals would refrain themselves from this act.
Essay 799:
During the last decades the number of individuals, that use the World Wide Web as a necessary tool of communication, has increased dramatically. Indeed, much more persons communicate with each other through the Net. It has been a worrying trend for those who enjoy the face-to-face interaction. However, others have seen it as a positive change.
To begin with, the Web is a great way of communication between people. For example, only by using the Internet a person can talk with those who are living in a different part of the world. Thus, the distance does not matter for it. Additionally, it is possible to send an email to any person on the planet and that letter the receiver will get in a second after it has been sent. Therefore, the Net allows making the communication faster. By connecting to the Web from any place, a person can access any information available there. For instance, read a favourite newspaper or find a financial report of a listed company in ASX.
On the other hand, while people with passion and enthusiasm using the Net, their time of social communication has significantly reduced. This trend has a negative effect on individual’s health and their life. For example, those who spend too much time on the Internet sit most of that time and, as a result, they may become obese. Moreover, this obesity might be a cause of diabetes in the future. Another drawback is that the internet users have the lackings of face-to-face interaction, which leads to lonely personal life without having a partner and children.
To sum up, it is evident that the Internet has brought advantages as well as disadvantages to the person’s life. I firmly believe that individuals as a whole have faced much more benefits than drawbacks from using the Internet as a method of communication because an individual can balance the time they spend on the web and leave the time on other things.
Essay 800:
In these days, sports channels telecast almost all major sports events from across the world. It has become a cash cow of many television networks. At this juncture, many people, including talented ones, glue to the television. Though it brings about an extreme satisfaction to viewers, many youngsters fail to participate sports activities which are organised around.
Firstly, sports events aired on the television drain a great deal of time of viewers. To be more precise, discussions and critics along with the sports episodes waste the valuable time of event watchers. By this problem, youngsters go to the ground once in a blue moon. Furthermore, many sports events such as test cricket serious call for many days to reach the final stage. A viewer who watches this kind of sports event on television hardly get time to participate other sports. To cite an example, world cup and cricket final telecasting time has become a holiday for many national and international stadium because of lack of participants.
Secondly, television telecasts provide only theoretical knowledge of sports rather than practical knowledge. An unpracticed sportsman needs to pull his socks up to become a man of the match. In addition to that, a sportsman needs to hone his skills by continuous practical exposure. Moreover, they need to go the extra mile to become a national or international sports icon. Instead of paddle once own canoe, simply watch the sports event on the small screen does not facilitate to become a sports star. A recent sports magazine reports that the successful sportsman spent very less time to watch sports on television is the best epitome.
By and large, I hold the view that the excess sports event watch on small screen badly affect the youngsters to come practical field. They enjoy events on the television as a piece of cake and they assume that the spot is a cake walk. Anybody really needs to become sports figure, they must put up with is practical sides.
Essay 801:
Due to globalisation, a paradigm shift of people's lifestyle and expansion of tourism and international commerce, cheap and frequent flights all around the world is quite common nowadays which offers both advantages and disadvantages. In this essay, I shall examine both positive and negative aspects of such flights before drawing a reasonable conclusion.
With regards to advantages, frequent flights have made the air travel affordable for many and as a consequence, more people can enjoy the fast and flexible journey. Increasing flights also expand the tourism and business opportunities and thus indirectly creates more job opportunities. Moreover, people have more places to visit, venture in new business opportunities, avail advanced medical facilities in developed countries and learn more by travelling. The frequent travels, in a way, reduce the cultural gaps among people of different countries and bring nations together. Last but not least, many multinational companies can run their operations smoothly across cities due to easily-available air travel and this has a direct impact on creating more employment scopes.
On the other hand, detrimental effects of the rapid increase in air travel cannot be ignored. The amount of air pollution it causes is quite alarming. A single flight emits a huge amount of carbon dioxide to the air contributing to the greenhouse effect. Furthermore, airports in cities hamper the peace of local people and increase the possibility of terrorist attacks.
Many experts suggest that one way to check the negative consequences of increasing air travel is to impose more tax. Though this might seem a reasonable solution, I, however, disagree. More effective solutions like introducing eco-friendly jet fuel and tight security should be in place rather than increasing the tax which would only burden mass people to pay more for their travel.
To conclude, ever-increasing air travel has some negative outcomes like air and sound pollution and threat to the national security. However, imposing a heavy tax is not a viable solution to this and cheap and frequent flights have facilitated people in many ways which are a timely demand of modern people.
Essay 802:
People these days travel around the world for numerous purposes, and hence the number of flights is on the rise. But having the flights have both advantages and disadvantages as well. I will discuss the issue briefly in the following paragraphs and show my opinion whether imposing more taxes should be implemented or not.
First of all, people take flights for some of the specific reasons. Speed is the key advantage here. It is only the air travel which provides the maximum speed and thus the travellers can save their valuable times. Besides, Comfort is another aspect of flights. When you will be on board on an aeroplane, you will feel comfortable like your own home. Further, when someone is on air, they are able to enjoy the attractive view of the ground which is a completely different experience.
In opposite, there are some disadvantages have been found for the flights as well. Price is an important matter to consider. Often the prices of air tickets are higher and everyone is unable to bear such expensive tickets. Besides, some of the airliners charge for the snacks and meals or waters they serve during the trip. Sometimes, the journeys are tiresome as well and people suffer from jetlag. Place crash is a shocking issue for the passengers as there are fewer chances to survive a plane crash.
Taxation on tickets is moderate now and I have experienced that recently. A couple of weeks ago, I travelled to New York from Massachusetts by a local airliner. They charged me 15% tax of the entire ticket value. So, I think this is moderate and if the tax is increased, it would be difficult for ordinary people like us to have the air travels in our need.
Essay 803:
The world population has reached over 7 billion and the number is increasing every day. It is often cited that mother planet, Earth, will not be able to accommodate the overwhelming number of people in the future and we will have to settle on a different planet. If this is the case then space exploration is the solution to this issue. What we see as a plot of science fiction movie today will be a reality tomorrow and I believe that human will live on other planets in the future.
To list down the advantages of space exploration, we have to mention the knowledge we learn from it first. Space exploration has made it possible for us to understand the pattern of the universe and the solar system. Without knowing the universe, human will never be able to fully understand the Earth. Thus space exploration is an important part of knowing who we actually are. Knowledge acquired from space exploration has been proven to challenge our existing perspective of life and has enriched human capabilities. Many inventions and advancement in technology and theoretical science have been possible only because of our activity in outer space.  
Secondly, it’s been around 50 years of human activity in outer space and this has improved the life on Earth. The first satellite was designed to study the space environment has opened the door of many possibilities like satellite communication, advancement in weather forecasting, global positioning and so on.
Thirdly, though space exploration we have learned many aspects of addressing global challenges. It also makes us better suited to prevent catastrophic events like asteroid strikes and similar events. The joint venture on space exploration increases diplomatic relationship among nations and increases the international preparedness to address any issue arises on Earth. The future exploration will surely bring many benefits towards the development of nations and even settling on a different planet.
The world population is already beyond the carrying capacity of our planet and the predicted global warming and meltdown of polar ice will diminish many highlands. This will only leave us one choice, to settle down on a different planet that can support life.
Essay 804:
Few people are of opinion that it is the responsibility of the schools to hone the skills of children. I disagree with the notion that the educational institutions should be responsible for developing the children into good parents in the future. This essay will discuss the reasons for this and the requirements to be a skilled parent.
It is of paramount importance that the centre of learning should give priority in teaching the academic subjects rather than the parental role .Even though the children are made aware of their future role as parents and how to play that effectively, it would in no way help in fetching a job, a successful career or attaining financial stability in life which are the most important benefits to be reaped out of education.
Another reason is perhaps, it would not be an effective method since the teenagers might not have the maturity to understand the responsibilities of a parent. This is because, they have to connect the happenings in their family to the subjects taught in the school, which is again too much strain for a child. In this way, it can be argued that teaching the role of parents in schools would not be pragmatically fruitful unless it is intuitively assimilated from their parents and family members.
In regard to the competence of a mother or a father, there are several things to be considered; first and foremost is the abundance of love and care, secondly strict rules to discipline their life, thirdly responsibility, fourthly doing things that the children would find inspirational and lastly to be able to educate them. What’s more is expertness in handling finance so that the children can have a better healthcare, food, education and relaxed life.
To conclude, the academic subjects should be concentrated and taught in schools, as it had been until now since it is the most integral part education. This is not only because of the mindset of juveniles but also to extirpate such classes and let them learn from their own parents during the course of life.
Essay 805:
Some individuals believe that to be a good parent, adolescent must be taught about parenting in school. However, whether or not this parenting class in school is effective, it is still debatable. Nonetheless, personally, I agree that every teenager must learn how to be a good parent in school based on the importance of parenting class to present skills needed by teenagers.
To begin with, parenting class is considered as rudimentary need before entering family life and therefore, it should be given to students in their school. Several preliminary studies found that good parents can affect children’s attitude and behaviour later. By attending parenting classes, young people will be supplied abundant skills needed of how to educate and grow children well. As the result, young children can be more ready and understand how to care children, can be more aware of some menaces may be found during family life and can bring up children appropriately thus they can have good attitude and morale. By attending these classes they can also learn the importance of having a family and sacrifices their parents made for them.
Furthermore, several skills must be adopted by adolescent before being parents. For instances, how to care baby bruise, how to be a good new mum, how to pick proper supplementation for children, etc. new mother had to encounter some conditions of the baby bruise, and this condition requires prompt treatment despite offspring and maternal safety. Starting breastfeeding to infant also needs skills in order to keep the breastfeeding healthy for baby as well as to select complementary food for children to support growth. These skills can be developed through parenting class in school.
All in all, school is a place to educate pupils in every part of life including parenting class for students to help them more understand their duties of how to be a good mother/father as being a good parent needs various parental skills.
Essay 806:
Throughout the 21st century, a lot of universities have been built across the globe. It has become extremely easy for the students to get admission in universities to pursue higher studies in the area of their interest. I agree that when more students attain degree means that it will bring a positive impact on the society.
Firstly, students have the flexibility to choose a course when universities provide multiple courses, especially new ones, based on the course subject, fees or duration. For example, a financially backwards person can opt for a low budget course and still become a graduate. Thus, universities can empower the society.
Secondly, finding a breakthrough in a career is easy when a person has some specialised skills. Moreover, there are many industries facing resource shortage. For instance, as per the report published by the Week magazine dated 2th September 215, illustrates that hundred percent of the students in the hotel management course are being a job offer in their final year, by the industries requiring them. Therefore, the special skills universities benefit both students and industries.
Finally, a sense of public awareness is created among the citizens, which results in the decrease of crime rate as well as improvement in the behaviour of the people, due to the knowledge gained in their courses. For example, this decade crime rate has drastically reduced by 10 percent compared to the previous one. Therefore, by having more education, the earth can become a better and safe place to live.
In conclusion, education can bring in a myriad of benefits to the society. It is the duty of the respective governments to ensure that their citizens are well educated and support the needy. The more choices on universities and area of studies in those universities undoubtedly have many positive impacts.
Essay 808:
Respect shown to senior citizens is often considered by many as an important indicator of a civilised society and yet this is on the decline in many countries. In my opinion, lack of proper teaching at home and a paradigm shift towards a materialistic life are the reason for this trend. This trend can bring some negative consequences in our society which would be outlined in this essay.   
In regard to the declining respects for elderly people, the family bonding and parents teaching methods at home are to be blamed. The family value and bond are no longer important to the young generation these days. They are not entirely responsible for this social debasement as parents nowadays are too busy to teach their children morality. On top of that, young generation in this era is more occupied with materialistic possessions than reading history and learning about their traditions and cultures. As a result, they fail to understand how important it is to show respect to other members of the society, especially senior citizens. To illustrate an example, one of my classmates, Tony, was raised in a nuclear family and without his father. When he visited our house, he had no idea that my grandparents could live in our family. Certainly, he would not know how to spend time with people over 60 years old!
Among the negative consequences of this trend, the most severe one is the moral degradation of youth. Since they find it unnecessary to show proper respect to elder people, they will soon forget to respect other human beings. Moreover, they will fail to teach their next generation anything about mutual respect and family value, they will suffer even more when they become old. Finally, as a whole, the society would have selfish members who would not be able to maintain a social harmony.
To conclude, the society we live in is the contribution os the senior citizens and that is why the young generation should show their respect and gratitude to them. The lack of respect towards the elderly is a great concern and to mitigate this problem, parents should teach their children morality and importance or family bonds.
Essay 810:
Nowadays stress has become a serious problem than it was in the past. Over the world, many different diseases are caused by stress. In today’s world, some people ask themselves why stress is such a big issue as well as how to reduce it. This essay will discuss the causes to stress related illnesses and solutions to deal with this problem.
In the highly competitive environment stress is an illness that experienced approximately everyone because of modern tension and pressure whereas before individuals had fewer issues to think about. For example, our generation works longer hours and bear a heavy workload in comparison with the past generations. The business competition will be more serious in the future and as a result, more and more people will suffer from stress-related issues. The increasing competition and challenges in every field of life, lack of family and social bonding, increasing expenses, political instability, international tension, environmental pollution, longer working hours, high expectation and dependency of technology everywhere are some of the main reasons the stress related problems are so high these days.
In comparison with the past when people did not have to think about the existence of stress, nowadays it has become a global problem. People had the same diseases in the past but they did not know for sure what the causes were. Recently the cause was found – the stress which is a serious threat to the wellbeing of human and leads to many negative symptoms that exhaust a person’s body and mind. With the less population, the competition was lesser and the environment was better in the past. That’s why they had comparatively less stress in their lives.   
The key to a stress-free life is being contended with whatever we have. If we can be happy with whatever we have got and aspire for a bright future, we will definitely have less stress related issues. Everyone must maintain a balanced work and social life in order to lessen the amount of stress related problems they suffer. Getting engaged in physical activities and hobbies can be another solution to address this. The employers should reduce the working hours and arrange other facilities to reduce the amount of pressure the employees feel in the workplace. Our social and family bonding can also help us to fight this problem to a great extent. 
There is no doubt that over the last few years stress has become one of the major reasons for serious illnesses such as heart diseases, asthma, obesity, diabetes and headaches. For this reason, ideas like relaxation centres, aromatherapies and massage centres have emerged and they can help people to reduce their mental pressure. Doing exercises, communicating with friends and families or organising a hobby will make them happier and busier in the daily routine.  
To sum up, life has become more stressful for our generation than the past generations and thoughtful measures could be taken to address this issue including strong relationship, engagement in activities, and working smarter than working harder and for long hours.
Essay 811:
Fast Food as the name indicates the availability of food to eat in a jiffy. The main reason for the flourish and success of fast food is the change in the lifestyle and the competitive environment prevailing in the society. Let us evaluate the success of the fast food in detail and the ways to kerb it by heeding to the sayings of the doctors, nutritionists and clinical experts.
Essay 812:
It is a common thing that governments will protect some of the historical buildings in their country, but some people disagree with it. They believe that these old buildings should be demolished and replaced with new ones, as the demand for properties is increasing rapidly these days. I believe that maintaining some of the historical buildings is an important thing and a combination between classic and modern buildings in the city would be an advantage for the city itself.
For a number of reasons, maintaining historical building is an important thing. Firstly, these historical buildings have become the witness of some of the country's significant and monumental events. For example, White House had been the witness of how the American had obtained its independence from the British, and how slavery had been ceased by Abraham Lincoln. Secondly, many old buildings contain a priceless value of art, as some buildings were designed by famous architects or painted by some legendary painters such as the church in Rome which was painted by Michelangelo. Therefore it is important for the government to preserve old buildings.
Many cities have successfully combined classic and modern buildings in their master plan. As they have realised that this combination would make the city become more attractive. In cities such as in London, Brussels and Paris, people would commonly see that many historical buildings are preserved as museums or become government offices. Standing to these historical buildings are new and modern buildings which have a futuristic design. Many people believe that the combination has made these cities become unique and attractive for tourists. As a result, it has boosted the city tourism industry and created a lot of job opportunities for the local people.
In conclusion, many countries are protecting old buildings, as they believe that preserving and maintaining the buildings is an essential thing. Although some people think that old buildings should be replaced with new ones as the demand for properties has increased significantly, I personally believe that some of the old buildings should be preserved, as they have historical and artistic values. Besides that, the combination of old and modern buildings would make the city become more unique and it would attract many tourists.
Essay 814:
With an emerging impact of advertisements, young people's diet habit is a concerning issue as the number of overweight children is on the rise. While some people are convinced that adverts targeting the young residents to shape their preferences of food have higher influence than family and friends. I, however, disagree with this notion.
To begin with, we are living in a world where adverts are all around us and their influence on young generation is more severe than adults. Advertisements, especially those targets teenagers and related to food and beverage, spend a huge amount of money to allure them to a better living standard which are, most of the cases, lies. Consequently, young people are trapped and prefer fast food than home-made menus. For instance, a recent survey conducted on college students in my city revealed that they prefer pizza, subway sandwich and burger than the foods their mums prepare at home. Further studies explained that those students have little conscious of the balanced diet and are exposed to TV and online advertisements.                  
Having said that, family and friends have a greater influence on a teenager's eating habit. A family has a greater role in shaping a child's food intake habit and scientific studies prove that our diet habit is deeply rooted in the type of food we eat in our childhood. Thus, if a teenager has a bad eating habit, the family is to blame for that. On top of that, when a child starts making friends, he is significantly get influenced by his friends eating and drinking habit. To illustrate, based on a recent research published in the magazine 'Healthy Living', more than 70% school going teenagers try to mimic the diet habit of their friends who they spend time with. This statistics clearly reveal that our family members and friends have more influence on our choices of foods and drinks than the advertisements we are exposed to.
To conclude, food habit is a significant part of our life as it defines who we become and how healthy, both physically and psychologically, we would be in the future. Advertisements, to a certain extent, have an impact on young people's diet, but family and friends have an even greater role.
Essay 816:
Work-life balance is a concept that emphasises both the professional and personal life and in my opinion, personal interests are as much important as the works are. I believe that we should focus both on our career and hobbies to maintain a balance in our life and to lead a happy and meaningful life.
In regards to work or career, I think that it defines who we are and how we contribute to the society we live in. Perfectly executing our job responsibilities would ensure a steady career growth and a contentment in our life. It is quite reasonable that when we find our works interesting, we can excel in our performance as we work passionately. Undeniably, devotion on our jobs would bring out the best in us and let us reinvent our hidden potentials. To cite an example, many scientists, throughout the history, have completely devoted themselves to their work and have brought marvellous invention for the rest of the humanity. Thus to a certain group of people, work is far more important than any other thing in life.
In contrast, another group of people find their hobbies and leisure activities more interesting and focus more on these activities than their career and work. I believe, to a certain extent, they are prudent to emphasise more on things they feel attracted to as we have got only one life to live and being happy and contented is the mantra of life. However, their priority in life often lead to negligence in professional life and as a consequence, they suffer from economic disaster in later life.
To conclude, we are the ultimate architect of our life and how we lead our life would define our future. An intelligent person would focus both on work and hobby as he knows the work-life balance is the key to a joyful and prosperous life.
Essay 818:
The written exam was the only possible evaluation method in the past and thanks to the technological advancements for numerous other techniques to assess a student's academic performance nowadays. It is quite obvious that schools and other educational and training institutions are opting for a combination of different assessment methods and this shift has both advantages and demerits, which I shall examine in this essay.
To start with the advantages, practical approaches to evaluating students not only consider the overall learning and understanding of a student but also the accuracy and depth of their knowledge. For instance, in a paper based exam, a student can easily memorise the answers and perform well in written test; but when he is asked to demonstrate the knowledge his knowledge in a lab, his memorise-and-answer ability would help him a little. In practical exams, students who have really learned the lessons would pass with flying colours. Furthermore, assessment methods like interviews, group assignments, presentations and lab experiments prepare pupil to face the challenges in professional life.  
Turning to the disadvantages of practical assessment, many students can cheat the evaluation process and pass the exam with a little devotion to study. For instance, a recent survey conducted on students in five different colleges revealed that students prefer group assignments, online presentations and lab experiments than written exam as they need to study more for the later one. On top of that, sometimes, teachers favour particular students and mark some students poorly due to personal reasons and the authority has little to do to reassess this marking scheme at a later date.
To conclude, genuine assessment of a student is quite an essential task for the schools and a combination of evaluation process should be implemented. Practical assessment offers many benefits and subsequently prepare students for the future challenges in both academic and professional environment.
Essay 819:
One of the burning issues in today’s world is the accurate method of evaluating students with practical tests instead of traditional written ones. There are some debates over the more usefulness and precision between these two methods and in this essay, I shall discuss both the benefits and negative consequences of this trend.  
To begin with, it is widely accepted that the technology has dramatically changed the way we teach and evaluate students. So, in order to follow new and improved developments and methods, we need new techniques in teaching. Therefore, the new trend of evaluating are needed in order that old ones can no longer assess how much students understand their courses. There is a convincing evidence that written exams are time-consuming and cannot illustrate student’s knowledge correctly since some people only memorise everything very fast, but eventually, they forget everything even faster.
Having said that, it must not be ignored that it is actually difficult to score students by their performance even if the practical approach of evaluating is followed. It also depends on the perception of examiners and having experienced teachers in our educational institutes is also a challenge. In addition, more time and money have to be spent on practical tests with fixed criteria of grading. Thus it is the obvious reason why traditional methods have been kept its popularity till now. Additionally, in some courses such as history and so on there are no sufficient requirements on practical assessment, hence traditional methods can estimate appropriately and in areas like this, a combination of exam system should exist.
Overall, despite some drawbacks of practical tests, it has become one of the main procedures of evaluating students recently but written exams are also widely used all around the world. I believe that both types of exams are required for investigating students skills and abilities.
Essay 820:
Like many other technological tools, modern home entertainment devices have both positive and negative aspects. However, overall, this has far more advantages than demerits and if not overused, technologies like the high-speed internet and smart TV can be  great learning tools for the people, especially young.
To begin with, powerful internet connection, smart TV, gaming console etc. all have entertaining as well as educational values. If not misused, young generation can learn from these sophisticated and advanced devices. The merits or demerits of these devices lie on the parental guidance and the way they are utilised. For instance, if a child watches TV programmes all day long, it would negatively affect his eyes, health and academic performance. However, if a teenager watches educational videos and programmes on YouTube and channels like the NetGeo or  Discovery, he would definitely learn many new things.
Another key point to remember, people need entertainment in order to lead a stress-free and happy life. The lack of entertainment facility often attributes towards the moral degradation and this is quite alarming. Hence, people must have ways to spend some quality times on their own. Modern tools like computers, tabloid PCs and smart TVs fill the gap and allow busy people find ways to enjoy their leisure time. Considering this, I would like to suggest that latest technology for the personal and family entertainment is rather a blessing.
To conclude, the home entertainment technology itself does not have the ability to bring detrimental outcomes for people. Rather how we use them defines how useful or harmful those devices are and that is why we should be more sensible to use those technologies even if they are meant to entertain or educate us.
Essay 822:
Historical places have long been a staple destination for tourists recently. However, in recent years there is not an inclination for local people to visit these sites and these places are always packed with tourists. There are several reasons for this problem and various measures can be taken by governments to improve this situation.
The high cost of entrance fee and monotonous atmosphere are the main causes of discouragement of local people to go to museums. From an economic standpoint, this amount might be desirable for the tourists who choose travelling and they are aware of this cost. However, indigenous people are less likely to spend for visiting the place that they have already known what they expect to see. At the same time, a boring ambience of historical sites is another reason. Since local have basic knowledge about the history of their country, there is nothing interesting in persuading them to visit there. Therefore, these places can be found a waste of money and time entirely.
Encouraging locals and lower admission fee are the keys to solving this problem. One should note that it is governments' responsibility to put forward so as to boost the proficiency of historical sites. They can encourage people of the country to visit these places and transfer their observation to the next generation. People find these places more enjoyable if especial events and festivals are held there. Besides, imposing especial offer, discounts and free entrance at weekend, for instance, would be another way to attract the attention of local residents.
Essay 823:
In today’s world exploitation and exploration of natural resources, at its peak for the sake of personal benefit.  This is an alarming situation and there is dire need of taking precautionary measures. Despite this, I do not agree to some extent to limit the use of modern products and encourage companies to make long lasting products. By doing so, we are compromising safety issues and depriving people to take benefits from the modern and advanced technology.
There is no doubt that modern products are designed in accordance with latest technology and safety measures. For instance, today’s cars are much better in performance and more secure than older cars, as a new car has the state of the art features such as the airbag, camera and the internet connectivity etc. Those functions make cars more reliable and durable and comfortable for its users. Additionally, being a part of the modern and diverse world, one should be equipped with modern products to create ease and comfort in their life.
Durable and long lasting products will create discrimination among people, as such products require huge amount for its development and would not be in reach of poor people. Moreover, this will have negative impacts on new and inexperienced companies to develop kind of products that demand enormous funds and time. Thus, it will cause unemployment as not too many businesses would able to bear huge expenses.
Frequently changing the car or other luxury items by rich is a negative tendency and the government take steps to aware them, but it would not be successful to a large extent. The government ultimately won’t be able to prevent rich people from doing so. In this regards, other alternatives like recycling products whenever possible, imposing more tax on luxury items etc. could be more effective.  
Essay 824:
It is true that using of various transport systems, supported by the government, including the public transportation is extremely important for many people living in urban or rural areas. Undeniably, citizens have faced numerous issues when it comes to commuting between their home and destination, including accessibility or quality. While public transports are very important to reduce the number of private cars running in the cities, it has some disadvantages as well. I personally believe that these problems can be addressed with some pragmatic solutions.
The first important factor why the public are not interested in using buses or trains is the lack of availability. Unfortunately, many inhabitants living outside of central cities cannot usually find adequate buses or monorails. In particular, in the Northshore areas of Vancouver city of Canada, individuals cannot easily travel by Skytrain because there is no any train station there. Had the government of BC extended this type of transport, more dwellers would have accessed it. As a result, to find better solutions to this issue, public transportation must equally be reachable to all citizens living even in remote areas.
Another reason is the poor quality this method of transport has. Obviously, in many highly populated poor countries, this type of transportation has considerably deteriorated. As a prime example, in Iran, the lifetime of some buses backs to over thirty years or more, and their capacity is not as much as used to be. Many passengers have to stand on their feet all over their travelling because of the shortage of spaces, and there is no any specific seat for children or equipped facilities for elders which many modern buses have. To address it, the state administrations are better to increase the budget of public transport and renew the old buses or trains, which have endangered people’s safety.
The public buses in many areas do not have fixed timetable and people have to wait for a long to get on a bus. Apart from that, privacy is another concern for people. When public transportation system is very effecting in reducing congestion and air pollution, these two aspects often deter people to use them. Improving the service quality and imposing strict rules by the authority could be an effective solution to this problem.
To sum up, public transportation is being used by many of citizens in each country though who can afford private cars usually avoids public transportation. However, it is important to encourage people to use public transportation more to reduce the traffic jam and pollutions. From my perspective, to solve the problems like quality or accessibility, transport authorities have to increase the number of public vehicles in all over the country and replace the old transport systems with the modern ones with better facilities and regulations.
Essay 825:
While some opine that university education is a must, others, however, emphasise the need for vocational training and practical skills more. No doubt skills on practical works like plumbing, painting, repairing, automobiles etc. are essential for the young generation to start a career early, but university education offers something more and creates a better future generation. This essay will discuss both aspects and point out my opinion.
To begin with, university education has a paramount importance in shaping someone's ability, perspective and knowledge. That is why a person is thought to be prepared to start a career or open a business only when he completes his tertiary education. Many organisations, for instance, seek employees who have university degrees and research indicates that university graduates are more adept at learning new things in the corporate world, taking challenges, leading a team and bringing innovations. Thus taking up trade education or courses instead of getting admitted to a college or university would build up a generation who would be skilled in some particular fields, no doubt, but not ready to lead the country by contributing in a more efficient manner in their respective job or business fields. In many countries, such as India, a plumber, electrician or a painter have no scope to enhance their career in prestigious corporations or ever become a white collar employee. Furthermore, the society does not consider them as skilled employees since they do not have the necessary education to excel. Thus taking up university education in those countries is the only option to gather knowledge and secure a good career.
With regards to the trade courses to have a skilled workforce in a country, I believe that only a few developed countries should encourage their young population to start their career in such fields where they can have decent jobs. For instance, Finland already has this educational setup and they are quite successful. Furthermore, skilled people will never be unemployed and thus would contribute to the national economy at an early age.
To conclude, though having trade related courses and vocational education to start a career early and to maintain a social skill balance us a good option, I believe that university education is far more beneficial. It should be ensured by the government that deserving students get university education though there is no harm in including some trade-related training courses in university to make them more skilled.
Essay 827:
Vegetarians tend to avoid consuming meat and fish on the purpose of keeping body health and concerning on environmental issue. Both purposes will be discussed in this essay as well as provide several convincing explanations.
Vegetarians tend to consider health factors to stop consuming meat and fish because those kinds of food sources affect the blood tension of those who suffer from chronic disease such as cancer, obesity, etc. Other reasons from a health point of view of people become vegetarian because they need to lose weight or to have a better body shape. Moreover, choosing to consume vegetables rather than meat or fish becomes a trend to keep the body healthy.
On the other hand, being a vegetarian is one of the ways to protest the policy of the government or criminal action against environmental issues such as cruel animal slaughtering, fish-bombing, etc. Moreover, being vegetarian is believed as the best solution for keeping the balance of the ecosystem among humans and animals.
However, another reason not to eat meat or fish is related to ethical concern on how there are several values or rules in a certain community that forbid to eat both food sources. They believe that animals are just like the human being that should be respected as well as conserve their lives.
To conclude, vegetarians who consider health issues and environmental issues, as well as ethical concern, have their own reasons. In addition, both views are merely positive to keep the body health individually as well as to conserve the sustainability of animal lives globally.
Essay 828:
It is a fact that several groups of people prefer not to consume any kinds of meat and fish, as they believe that being vegetarian bring many benefits for their health and for the world as a whole. To a certain extent, I would agree with the opinion, but I think that people should also consume meat and fish in a proportional portion as they contain rich ingredients that are needed by human’s body.
For a number of reasons, some people choose not to eat fish or meat. Firstly, it is believed that several types of meats and fish contain fats which are considered unhealthy for the human’s body. People who consume those kinds of meat or fish have a higher risk of cardiovascular diseases such as heart attack or cholesterol. Secondly, as the demand for meat and fish increases, it would have a negative impact on the environment. The increasing number of farming activities would require bigger areas, which might reduce the number of forest areas.  And then with over-exploitation of fishing activities, several types of fishes would extinct and it would make the sea ecosystem become imbalance.
On the other hand, many food scientists have found out that there are several types of vitamins and proteins that could only be obtained from meat and fish. For examples, Salmon fish generates a certain type of oils which are beneficial for our blood circulation process. And then, red meat is needed as the source of nutrition for the human’s brain. However, the main problem of those who consume meat and fish is that most of them consume the food in an inappropriate portion. As a consequence, many of them have problems with obesity or diabetic.
In conclusion, it is true that some people believe that being a vegetarian is healthier than meat consumer, and it would also give a positive effect on the environment. To a certain point, I would agree with it, but meats and fish also contain certain types of nutrition that are needed by our body. I do believe that if we could balance the consumption of meat, fish and vegetable, it would make our body become healthier than the vegetarian.
Essay 829:
The consumption of animal products certainly has some health consequences. It hurts the environment as well. Some studies have shown that vegetarians tend to live longer than their meat or fish-eating counterparts. The environmental impacts of non-vegetarianism are even worse. Countless animals are raised, abused and slaughtered to fulfil the demand for meat and fish worldwide. Framing livestock is one of the major causes of greenhouse gas emissions worldwide. If we can reduce the consumption of meat, the need for raising more animals also reduces. As a result, the land that is being used to raise them can be altered to grow vegetables which in turn produce clean air for the whole planet. Obviously, cutting down on the consumption of animal products benefits the whole world.
However, meat and fish are an integral part of many cuisines; therefore, being a vegetarian is not an option in many regions of the world. To illustrate, sushi is the most popular Japanese delicacy and without the addition of its main ingredient, fish, sushi will not be complete. Meat consumption is particularly common in cold countries. There are also some regions where it is difficult to grow vegetables and cereals. Furthermore, fish and meat are excellent sources of proteins and some fatty acids crucial for good health. For this season, meat consumption is essential for people engaging in strenuous physical activities. Being vegetarian, for example, is not a viable option for a bodybuilder or an athlete.
In conclusion, even though there are advantages to vegetarianism, I believe that this lifestyle is not for everyone. Even so, in my opinion, everyone should make an effort to cut down on their consumption of animal foods. That way they can improve their health and save the planet from tons of greenhouse gases.
Essay 831:
People have different opinions about leadership in a corporation or government institution. A group of people believe that managerial and similar high-level positions should only be occupied by men, while others think that women could also be  good leaders. The following essay will discuss both views, but I personally believe that competency is the most important aspect in term of leadership.  
For a number of reasons, many people believe that men should be the leaders in companies or government bodies. Firstly, based on the psychological approach, men use ratio when they make decisions. Therefore they decisions would be more logical and reasonable. Secondly, men are the better decision makers when they have to make a sudden or urgent choice. Again certain jobs demand responsibilities that could be better performed by man than women.  
On the other hand, another group of people believe that women should also be given the chance to occupy important positions in a company. They believe that leaders should not be elected based on genders, but based on their competency. They also believe that leader is not purely a natural gift, as leadership could also be learned. Some of the examples would be Margaret Thatcher who successfully led England in the eighties and Hillary Clinton who became one of the ministers in the USA and now running for the presidential election.  These women have shown that they have all the competencies of becoming a good leader.  
In conclusion, some people still believe that gender would have a significant effect on leadership, but I disagree with the statement.  I personally believe that competency and experience of the individual, be it a man of woman is the most important aspect of choosing a leader in an organisation.
Essay 833:
With the marvel of technological progress, the process of learning and teaching have changed to a great extent and the modern children, most of the time, use computers to compose their essays, presentation and homework. One group of people thus think that handwriting skills for children are no longer relevant while many others disagree. In this essay, I shall discuss both aspects and include my verdict.
To begin with, education sectors and schools in many countries have embraced the computer and the internet technology and the way of teaching and learning is no longer the same as it was in the past. For example, one of my nephews, George, who is 4 years old, have learned the alphabets, colours, digits and many rhymes from the internet which was unimaginable even in our era. University students prepare their assignments and thesis on a computer, a plagiarism checking software initially reviews it, the teacher assesses the answers on a computer and this process goes on with the help of technology. Professionals like journalists, writers, bloggers, programmers, bankers and so on, no longer need to write manually as computers are there for them. With more corporations going digital, the need for handwriting is shrinking rapidly. Furthermore, may of the standardised exams have their computerised version and this eliminates the needs for an excellent handwriting skill and demands the skill of typing on swipe a digital device like the computer.
According to the second group of people, handwriting is still essential and no matter how much dependant we become on technology, it will always be a handy ability for a person. For instance, a computer literate would still be considered ignorant if he can not write something on a paper. This group of people also opine that handwriting ability enables someone to excel in his academic studies and exams. Though some exams have become digitalised most others require us to write on a paper using a pen or pencil. Thus to present our skills we still need the handwriting skills. Last but not least, use of the technology requires electric power, devices like computers and the internet connections which are yet to be available in many parts of the world. For students in such areas, handwriting skill is a must.
To conclude, a thorough analysis of the topic reflects that handwriting is still an essential skill and parents, for this reason, should focus on developing this ability among their children from and early stage.
Essay 835:
With the rapid development of internet technology, people have access to various kinds of information these days. Some people believe that it brings so many benefits for the public, while others disagree with it. The following essay will discuss the pros and the cons but I believe that it has more advantages than the disadvantages.
It is true that with the existence of online technology, a vast amount of information has been connected together and this information is open to the public. A group of people believe that this development has negative effects on individuals and societies. As the internet could provide any information to anyone, people could misuse it. One of the examples, a terrorist could learn how to make bombs through the web, as some websites provide this kind of information. Consequently, the number of terrorist attacks has increased rapidly in the past few years. Another example is that some websites are providing illicit videos or violence scenes to public, which would have physiological effects on children and teenagers.
On the other hand, another group of people believe that the Internet and open information technology have brought many benefits for human kinds. Firstly, with the easy access to information, it helps students and scholars in doing their paper works and assignments. With the existence of various search engines such as Bing and Google, they could search any data that are correlated to their tasks. Secondly, people could use the online technology for learning. Many educational institutions are providing online courses these days, which help people who are busy or live in remote areas but enthusiastic in learning. Again, the internet also provides job postings which are available for the public. It is a fact that websites such as indeed or jobsdb have helped millions of job seekers in finding a job. Finally, internet technology not only provides information to public but also bring them together. Thus social websites help people learn new information and protest any event they do not like. Information is power and when people are connected with it, they will become more educated, informed and cautious and an educated and informed generation would be able to build a better world.  
In conclusion, with the existence of internet technology, people could have access to various kinds of information these days. It is undeniable that the development has some of its advantages and disadvantages to our life and society. I personally believe that it has more benefits for us rather than the drawbacks, as long as we use it for positive activities.
Essay 837:
Yes, it is true that a large percentage of people today live and work in other nations compared to the past. However, it doesn’t imply that  people would be able to move freely between nations in the future and countries will be borderless.
Just forget about the free commute between nations, it is even not possible within a country. Let us take the example of India. There are many youngsters who leave their native towns to work in metro cities to earn a good living for their family. However, they are not readily accepted by the city. The priority is always given to local residents who have knowledge of local people, traditions, and what works well in a particular city.
The outsiders are considered only when there is a need. When it comes to acceptance, let us get back to the time of financial crisis. At that time, the first people to lose their jobs were the people who came to work in the U.S. from other nations.
The various nations are implementing even more restrictive and stringent immigration policies. Such measures are being imposed at precisely the same time when migration to other nations has become an increasingly vital part of people’s plans for getting access to life resources.
Before even we think of no borders, it is essential to eradicate the other problems related to immigration. The spousal visa holders, renewable working permits and other temporary visas that face several challenges are often suspended in future with people stuck in devastating consequences.
Essay 838:
It is believed that changing people’s perspective and way of thinking to advance a country's culture and habit is an essential factor in reducing the worldwide poverty problem. However, other people disagree with it and think that increasing trade activities between countries and regions are more important. This essay will discuss in details about the two opinions, but  my point of view, I do believe that both views are important and they should be combined.
On the one hand, some people think that increasing trade volume among nations will reduce the world poverty issue, especially trade between poor and advanced countries. It is a fact that due to the high unemployment rate in third world countries, labour and production costs in these countries are lower than in advanced countries. This condition has attracted so many investors from developed nations in doing trading and investing activities to many third world countries. And when trade volume increases, it will automatically create job opportunities for the local people, and gradually reduce the unemployment rate and poverty level.  
On the other hand, other people think that the root cause of the world poverty problem is the mindset and attitudes of the people themselves. Most of the poor people have a traditional mindset and believe that education is not an important factor for success. As a result, they have a simple mindset and lack of skill which definitely affect to their economic conditions. Therefore, it is believed that poor countries should observe and learn the habit and the attitude of advanced countries’ people. By learning from them, it is expected that the perspective of the poor countries’ people will gradually change and hoped that their economic conditions will gradually improve. In conclusion, people have argued about how to resolve the world poverty problem. A group of people believe that the poor countries’ people should  the way of thinking and attitude of advanced countries’ people, while others think that increasing trades would be the best way to solve the issue.
Essay 839:
It is commonly believed that money brings happiness. However, it is a debatable fact that wealthier persons are happier and happiness is directly related to the money. According to me, money plays a vital in gaining happiness but a person feels joyful because of several reasons and they may or may be linked with money.
To begin with, money is important to satisfy the basic needs for survival. Nowadays, we require money everywhere- that could be educational institutions, hospitals, supermarkets, et cetera. A rich person can obviously afford to visit various places around the world, which makes one happier. Moreover, today, for spiritual or philosophical guidance one needs money. In few cases, one may obtain joy by helping the needy people by giving a handsome amount of donations. In this way, one might get happiness. Therefore, one may consider that, ‘Money is the existing God’ in today’s world and one becomes happier when one has money. However, real happiness is priceless and it cannot be attained with money.
Some others may argue that money could be useful to purchase the required things, nevertheless, one cannot buy happiness. For example, the happiness in the eyes of a mother when she gives birth to a baby cannot be bought by money. Next, real happiness is directly linked to the soul satisfaction. One can get exuberant joy without money as if by participating in charity work and so on. Hence, it is clear that one cannot relate happiness with money. Money can buy a luxurious house but cannot guarantee joy. Happiness comes from a satisfied soul and sound body while money can ensure the materialistic joys.   
To summarise, one may consider that money is very crucial in achieving happiness and some sort of people may also consider that ‘money makes the mare go’. However, what I believe is that money is certainly an important factor but not a sole factor to achieve happiness. Thus, I strongly disagree that happiness is obtained by money in all the cases.
Essay 840:
Nowadays, employers are offering a flexible working environment to their employees such as work from home or any other place of their own choice. This has become possible with the advancement of technology and hence dramatically improved workers’ performance. Some people argue that freedom of working location significantly helps in reducing time and cost incurred on travelling and other expenses. Others claim that companies from lucrative business often adopt this trend only because of their profit and this is negative for the employees in the long run.
Firstly workers spend a huge amount and significant time on travelling to and from their workplaces. This expenditure has to be pay from employee’s pockets; thus allowing them work from home would substantially save their money. Secondly working in a relaxing and stress-free situation drastically improve the quality of work and also reduce the time for the accomplishment of tasks. Additionally, an employee gets an opportunity to spend more quality time with their family at home.
However, a large number of employee deprive off from learning basic traits of office such as teamwork, dedication, punctuality and strategies forming in absence of professional working environment. Moreover, companies save handsome amount as they do not have to pay for building rent, bills and other expenditure incurred in running a business. On the other hand, employee pay is not commensurate with their efforts and skills. Since many companies do not need their employees to be present physically at the office, the authorities are taking advantages of this facility and creating negative impacts on the employee's future career.
To sum up I would like to say professional workplaces provide conducive learning and working environment than homes. Companies with free choice of work location are the main deterrent in employee’s future progress, as jobs ethics and behaviours can only be learned while working at a workplace.
Essay 841:
It is true that natural talents or skills probably can guarantee the future career of people especially in music, entertainment industries, literature etc. However, some people believe that they probably can be successful without having a skill or certain talent. I personally agree to say that people might achieve their goals of life without having a talent in terms of several reasons.
The first reason is that it is not talent that can guarantee someone’s success particularly in entertainment industries but the major factor is all about popularity. The popularity can be gained by doing such unusual action that may attract people’s attention loving to see or enjoy it. For example, there are some artists or actors are hired by the film production not because of their talents, moreover, it goes to the unique character of those persons that enable them playing comedian film.
The second reason is that the point of networking plays very important role in succeeding someone’s career in entertainment industry or arts. By having networks, we can easily get a job even though we do not have natural or genuine talents because people will recruit people who they know well by considering relationship and friendship values. For example, there are so many people sitting on the strategic position in a company because they have a closer relationship with the boss or managers.
However, it is true that talented and skilled people probably tend to work professionally but talents and skills can be replaced by popularity and networks which lead them to have a job sooner and the professionalism will be gained during the experience in working or can be possessed through training provided by those companies.
In short, popularity and networks tend to bring people having a wide opportunity in the job market and I believe that those kinds of things probably replace the existence of talents or skills as well as bring them to the prosperous and successful life.
There has been a fashionable trend nowadays to express individuals' talents for the sake of popularity and wealth. Also, there has been a developed attitude states" anyone can do it" in various types of talent. It then led to a result shows that people with no talents become rich and famous while those who were born with genuine talents are not valued or appreciated. This essay will present some arguments against this view.
Everyone is considered talented, whether is talented-born or talented-trained. There are many types of talent in some areas such as music, literature, sports, painting, acting.etc. The view that non-talented people become famous and rich mostly based on several facts occur in a country. Take Indonesia as an example, the actress and actors are famous because of movies they performed. The fact that the casting requires physical attraction more than talents is no longer a secret. Since it is undeniable that good looking actress and actors attract viewers easily. But, at the same time, these performers are demanded to perform maximum to increase the quality of a movie. In another word, they are trained to be talented in the area of acting as it is believed that practice makes perfect. The popularity and wealth then come after practical opportunities, as better they act, the more they are paid and more famous they become.
Moreover, it seems to be cruel to justify the genuine talents are not appreciated and valued considering the facts that sports athletes and singers are well known for their popularity and wealth. Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, Dianna Ross, Rod Stewart and so on are the real examples how genuine talents are praised. After all. To explore and provide more opportunities to those who are born talented, several events such as X-factor and Indonesian Idol are held to enhance them in introducing their genuine talents. These are held to provide more access to those who are considered less accessible regardless their physical attractions.
To conclude, I believe that all talents, whether it is genuine or product of habitual practices are well appreciated not only by popularity and wealth but also by-products they produce from various types of talents.
Essay 842:
At recent years, there is an ongoing debate whether all of the people are equal to be artists or it is supposed to be the talented ones who are worth to do arts. I believe that talented people should be appreciated for their masterpiece, and throughout this essay, I will give several considerations relating to my notion.
Each people has their own capabilities, interests, and talents. It is a fact that drummers master the drum music field such as the equipment, sophisticated techniques, etc. by autodidact or train themselves in certain courses to gain maximum skills and to be hired by a famous band. However, drummers may not have quite interests in acting or painting. As a consequence, the term 'anyone can do it' may be possible but the product of arts will not be a masterpiece. 
It is inevitable that the equal rights to do everything including to choose the profession as an artist is undeniable. As a consequence, every people wants to be a famous artist because of the popularity and the huge salary. This leads to a complicated problem for finding the true talents in doing the performance. To overcome this, managers, agents, and talents searching events are the bucket of solutions to look for the real talents needed by the arts industries. 
To sum up, 'anyone can do it' is a term caused by equal human rights among the people but people with original talents and interests accompanied by maximum development efforts are worthier to be appreciated as an art which they produced is overwhelming.
How do people become an artist? This question is a really fashionable trend in many parts of the world. Talentless people become an artist because of luck, a good opportunity, and networking. These reasons are commonly used by artists who are popular with this trend. I tend to disagree with this issue because becoming an artist is not about luck. I will outline the reasons and examples to support my arguments.
The job of an artist is an honourable job. S/he is public figures whom people always stare on their performance both in their real life and on their stages. Therefore, they need to give their best in their life to entertain people. They have to make a great preparation and hard work before becoming an artist, so their performance will not disappoint their fans. For example, singers should train their voice, learn about tunes and songs before their voice are enjoyed by many people. A singer who gets that "singer" title without ability will gain the bad judge even s/he produce a good song by the citizen.
In addition, artists who inexpert in their field are usually cannot survive for a long time, because they cannot perform a good performance. Take YouTube artists as examples, they only famous for several months and disappear because they lack the capability.
To sum up, I must say that people have to prepare themselves well before they act as public figures to survive in that industry. In my opinion, as a nature talent, being an artist is really a special career, therefore I disagree that people get that job only because of luck and no attempt to get that position.
In recent days, there are so many talentless people come to entertainment industries. It is easy for them to gain popularity compared with the other entertainers.  Some assert that talentless artist becomes rich and famous and the genuine talent will not be appreciated again. I personally disagree with this viewpoint and this essay will look into the reasons together with some considerations.
The first reason is that talent-less people obtain popularity for the short period of time. In my point of view, they cannot survive in the real competition with people who already have a remarkable talent in the entertainment industry. They are just becoming popular because of the role of media instead of their capabilities. For instance, there are some Indonesian artists becoming famous because of creating controversial issues. They have no capability which enables people to impress on them, thus it is quite easy for society to forget them. Meanwhile, talented entertainers will keep producing and showing their ability and capability so people will put more appreciation towards their performances.
Another reason is that the usage of technological enables people to show up and it is easy for them to attract society and to become a well-known person. Moreover, technology can make talent-less people look like a professional artist. Take being a singer as an example, when people have no ability to be a singer, technology usage can edit and perform their voice as a professional singer. I truly believe that they will not stay longer in their popularity because society is able to differentiate people who have great talent or not. Therefore, they cannot replace the position of the talented artist in society.
Essay 843:
There has been a dramatic increase in unemployment rate in developing countries over the last few years. However, with the effective use of technological advancement, this gap could be shortening to some extent. Information technology can play a significant role in the career development of youngster by adapting software and game development as their profession. I strongly believe that those new industries substantially help youth in better careers and open new horizon of opportunities for them.
Firstly, setup cost of such industries is very affordable and feasible, as it required a computer and a few software to start programming. This is not surprising that end products if fully developed could give them lucrative benefits and commercial gains. Moreover, youth can attract the attention of international customers by offering them cheap rate and reliable services by the use of numerous freelancing websites over the internet. Those websites pay their users in dollars after deducting a little charge for facilitating them.
However, governments can also play a pivotal role in mitigating youth woes in many ways. They should offer loan to the educated people on low markup rate to start their own business. This will encourage youngsters to show their entrepreneur skills and thrive in their field of choice. Secondly, there is a dire need to make rectification in the merit system, a large number of potential candidates deprived of getting jobs due to nepotism and favouritism by the authorities concerned. Finally, the government should generate new job vacancies in numbers proportion to population growth.
To sum up, I would like to say that youngster could get numerous benefits by using new and dynamic industries. As all the institutions are going to computerised, making new and lucrative opportunities for people associate with game and software industries. Moreover, vocational training by the government in information technology and other industries would help in depletion of unemployment.
Essay 844:
Traditional festivals and cultural celebrations are on the verge of disappearance in many parts of the world even though they have a paramount importance to the uniqueness of a country and a group of people. Globalisation, less adherence to the traditional ways of life and technological developments, in my opinion, are the main reasons for this great shift and I believe that patriotism and respect for someone's own cultural aspects could be the answer to this problem.
To begin with, the New Year eve, Halloween, etc. western ceremonies have become more popular these days than the traditional festivals in many countries. For instance, in many Asian countries, the new Year are more prominent celebration than their century-old festivals. Globalisation, the internet and satellite TV channels have made a lasting impression on young to accept foreign cultures even more. No doubt the traditional ways of life no longer have an appeal to the modern generation and thus they have inclined to accept global culture over their own ones.
In regards to preventing this development, parents and teachers should teach the younger students the value of their own culture. There is nothing wrong in knowing about the foreign culture but when they become our main culture, the problems arise. As the citizen of a country, we must not forget our history, tradition and culture. Thus the patriotic feelings should be nurtured to be even better citizens and prevent the detrimental effects of alien cultures. Moreover, more chapters on academic syllabus should be dedicated to teaching the students about our true identity, cultural aspects and traditions. This will create a sense of respect and adherence to our own culture.
To conclude, each tradition has its own set of traditional occasions and events which should be more emphasised than the foreign traditions. Building up an acute sense of patriotism and respect for our own culture is required to save our true cultural identity.
Essay 846:
Investment in space research is often debated and people who are against this venture suggest that eradicating deadly diseases, educating children, fighting crime, hunger and corruption and improving people's lifestyle are far more important than searching for life on Mars. I believe that outer space research is quite important and totally justify the cost it involves.
To begin with, the humankind always had problems on earth and a huge budget alone does not guarantee that we will be able to solve the crime, poverty, social discrimination and other pressing issues. To illustrate, some developed countries have better education facilities, lower unemployment rate and standard lifestyle and yet the crime rate is quite alarming in those countries. So diverting the budget from space research to the improvement of people's living style does not guarantee a result. Furthermore, only a handful advanced countries like the USA, the UK and Russia invest on outer space exploration. If they even stop the research, they are not going to give away the money to the poor nations.
Moreover, we live in an era which is the gift if scientific inventions and research. Yet we have to go a long way to bring more innovations to the humankind. To better understand our life on earth, we have to explore further. A solid understanding of the planets around us would open unimaginable possibilities for us. Millions of dollars spent on finding the existence of 'life' on Mars might prove to be the wisest idea ever for the human. Who knows Mars might be the next planet for us to live on!
To conclude, a large investment in the space research has not stopped countries from investing on our earth. The portion of the national budget by only a few countries to understand the universe we are a part of is quite reasonable towards the quantum leap towards the scientific improvements.
Essay 848:
Road safety has become a great concern for people with the rise of accidents and fatality those accidents cause every day. People have a varying opinion on how to make roads safe and I believe strict laws should be there to punish the driving offenders but a combination of other methods would bring better results.
On the one hand, people seem to abide by a law or rule when they know that violation would bring severe retribution. For instance, in some Asian countries pedestrians used to cross the roads and when a more rigid penalty has been imposed, those very people started using the underpass. From this perspective, strict penalty and fine can certainly improve the road safety as people would be more cautious and afraid of the consequence of the violation of the traffic laws. As an outcome, it is a fact that, the sterner the punishment, the greater chances that people would follow the rules.
On the other hand, there are already severe punishments for driving offenders including ceasing the driving license, monetary fines and imprisonments. Despite this, the number of road accidents is increasing every year. This is why I believe that only punishment cannot ensure the road security and safety. A combination of other initiatives is also required. First, we need to aware people about the devastating consequences traffic rule violations can bring to our life. Second, the requirements for passing the driving test should be standardised and made more practical, especially in developing countries where people can use advantages of the corruption. It is often noticed that many young people are given driving license without scrutinising their experience and skills. This should be completely avoided and after a certain period, each driver should be retested. Third, unfit vehicles should not be allowed to run on the roads as these cars cause more accidents according to the recent Road Transport Authority report. Finally, the traffic system of a country should be modernised and more surveillance cameras and speed test cameras should be there.              
At recent years, there is an ongoing debate whether giving dire punishment to driving offences are the best solution to overcome severe accidents in roads or not. While some support this idea, many others believe that governments should provide improvements in road safety. This essay will try to discuss both views with several considerations given underneath.
People are not prompted to engage safety driving because there are no regulations relating to drivers to be more careful on the road. It can be found in developing countries where the traffic is not well arranged and as a result, the numbers of terrible accidents remain dominant. Dissimilar with it, developed countries pay more attentions in this case by restricting the use of vehicles without licence limiting the top speed in certain busy areas such as boulevards and main roads, and imposing fine for all the offence forms in high rate, and as a result, these countries can overcome traffic accidents.
However, governments with all efforts must improve the infrastructure of safety riding. Traffic signs should be renewed, the facilities in the road are supposed to be changed, etc. so the drivers can recognise the driving surroundings vividly. Furthermore, technologies are also urgent to deal with daunting events in driving environment. It is good news that outrageously inventions have been created and applied but still attempts in technology findings are required.
In conclusion, while there are regulations to be defined, governments together with scientists, engineers, and car businessmen have to maximise in providing safety riding facilities to gain maximum result on this issue.
Essay 849:
A group of people believe that in order to increase the safety for the driving on roads, governments should make stricter regulations for any indiscipline in driving attitudes. On the contrary, another group thinks that authorities should consider other effective solutions for it. The following essay will discuss both views in details, but in my personal opinion, I do believe that the combination of both ideas would ensure a better road safety.
On the one hand, many people worry about the number of driving accidents. Each year, the number of people who are injured or pass away due to traffic accidents has increased significantly. In most cases, accidents have occurred due to the interdisciplinary acts of the drivers themselves, such as speeding,  drunk driving or using their mobile phones during driving. And to solve the problem, the government should make a strict regulation about traffic accidents. People who are found to be guilty of any driving rule violation should be punished with serious penalties and detentions. By having these kinds of policy, it is hoped that traffic accident rates will decrease gradually.
On the other hand, other people believe that strict punishments would not effectively solve the problem. There are other measures which governments and the public should consider. Firstly, governments could cooperate with the media in making campaign about safe driving. Television commercials and magazine advertisements could be used by the government in socialising about the negative effect of aggressive or offensive driving. Secondly, governments could also give rewards to their citizens who are obeying the road regulations. For example, when people renew their driving license, authorities could check their track records. Those who have clean track records could get motor vehicles tax discount or exemption.
In conclusion, people have a varying opinion on how to reduce the number traffic accidents. While some people believe that there should be stricter policies and regulations about driving, others think that there should be another effective way of addressing the issue. In my point of view, I believe that both policies have their own positive sides and when people could combine them, it would be an effective way of reducing traffic accidents. 
Essay 850:
Nowadays, the accidents that occur on the road are likely to rise in number in some countries. While an army of people think that these issues can be tackled by penalising offenders strictly, others think that there are other steps that can be taken to cope with it.
It is clear that the strict punishments set up for the driving offences can make them fear to break the laws. For instance, if they are proven to disobey the applied rules, it is seemly a good way to punish them by taking their driving licenses forcefully.  This measure is likely to alert them to think twice before breaking the laws because if they commit it they cannot drive anymore. This way can indirectly encourage them to obey the rules hence the accidents on the road are likely to be declined. The traffic rules are applicable only for the drivers, but also for the ordinary commuters as well. While an over-bridge or an under pathway is mandatory for crossing the busy roads, many people do not obey this rules. It is not unusual that many careless drivers do not follow the traffic signals and all these violations of traffic rules cause severe accidents and congestion in many cities. Hence, implementing strict punishment and fine can be one effective solution to tackle this issue.  
On the other hand, many believe that other measures could be more successful to address this problem, including creating awareness among citizens to drive safely, organising seminars & training programmes about the importance of road safety and modernising the traffic control system. The research carried out by Statistics Center, an organisation at the University of Diponegoro, reveals that citizens in Semarang who have wide knowledge about how to drive safely tend to obey the applied rules if compared to the ones who does not have this knowledge. This makes clear that these measures can be utilised to create a consciousness to be safe riders.
Apart from that, the number of cars and buses on the roads in many cities is much higher and restricting the private car ownership can reduce the number of cars on the roads and thus the number of accidents or casualties. Improving the traffic system with modern equipment and enrolling more trained and professional traffic police could be another great way to tackle this issue.
To conclude, the establishment of punishment strictly is a wise idea but by presenting workshops and training programmes to all citizens, especially drivers of different vehicles, improving the traffic control system are the finest ways to encourage them to increase security on the way.
Essay 852:
We live in a world which is full of advertisement and these adverts are consciously and subconsciously shaping our purchasing habits. Adverts that target children, be it on TV, billboards or the internet, should be completely banned as their marketing strategies to target children are totally unethical and have detrimental effects on our young generation.
In the first place, children are not decision makers and not matured enough to differentiate quality products from low-grade ones. Adverts that are primarily intended for young fail to comply with the very fundamental norm of ethical advertising - to inform people. For instance, many chocolate companies make advertisements to allure children and their adverts have more fantasy than facts. Though they know that parents would be the potential purchaser, they try to use the sentiments of children and their desires to trap parents to buy their products. Since this is quite obvious that advertisements made for children have an immoral and unacceptable objective, these adverts should not be allowed to be shown on mass media.
Furthermore, children these days watch TV more than ever before. This is why allowing fabricated and immoral adverts would expose them to a pseudo-real world where they would be brainwashed. Childhood is the most precious time for the proper psychological development and that is why adverts that target children are detrimental to their cognitive development.
To conclude, all campaigns and adverts that target children have only one thing common - mislead the young, allure them and force their parents to purchase products that they otherwise would not have purchased. Those unethical and heinous advertisement must be prohibited on TV by all means.
Essay 854:
Job opportunities are becoming highly competitive these days. Skills in a foreign language and mathematics keep a person the extra mile ahead of people with knowledge in music and arts. The importance of arts and music cannot be denied in a person's life but it is evident that for most jobs, a second language and mathematical skills are far more important. That is why I totally agree with the idea that children should focus more on mathematics and a foreign language in academic life than arts subjects unless he wants to become an artist or a musician in professional life.
On one hand, music and arts are important for our personal and social life. However, it can be learned by anybody but everybody cannot become an artist or musician without inherent talent and total dedication beyond academic study. Moreover job market for arts and music is much smaller when compared with technological and science-related occupations. For instance, if a media company requires an artist, they will hire very few artists and their communication and language skills would also be judged. At the same time, lower pay rates in art-related subjects should also be considered while deciding which major a child should take in his academic life.
On the other hand, mathematics is an essential subject that everyone should learn. This subject encourages children to think and improve their brain capacity and memory. Moreover, mathematics is involved and an important part of every job sector these days, including information technology, auto engineering, banking, designing, researching, construction engineering and so on.  At the same time, skill in an extra language always increases the opportunity for a job seeker. For example, when a Japanese Construction Company seeks a construction expert for their project, they would definitely prefer the person who knows Japanese among other candidates. Since one of the main objectives of academic lessons is to prepare children for their future careers, mathematics and second language should always get priority.  
To conclude, without a doubt learning mathematics and a foreign language signifies the capabilities of children and their future. I am not against teaching school children arts and music but as long as their future career is involved, teaching mathematics and a second language should always give priority. 
Essay 856:
Only a few percentages of people on earth are affluent while a majority of the world population is suffering from hunger, malnutrition, diseases, scarcity of housing, lack of pure drinking water and this list would go on and on. A group of people think that researching outer space is totally unjustified while people on earth have so many problems. On the contrary, the second group of people believe that outer world research is important for our own advancement. I agree with the second group of people who believe space research is necessary and justified.
First and foremost, only a few developed countries like the USA, Australia, Japan, Russia and the UK spend money and resources for the space analysis. If they stop this exploration and research, they are not going to give this fund to poor countries to fight their housing, crime, diseases, and hunger issues. To put in other words, practically it is not possible to use the space research fund to solve pressing issues of all the countries. Furthermore, poor and developing nations should utilise their own resources to address their problems rather than taking donations or loans from rich nations.
Another key thing to remember, space exploration is necessary to understand the universe and life on earth. This could open a whole new window of development. So far we have not been able to trace any intelligent species on other plant but who knows when we meet them what development and information they might share with us. IT might be the best next solution for the pressing issues we have on our small planet. We should not stop studying the universe we live in and concentrating on earthly issues is not a viable solution for the overall development of the mankind.
In conclusion, space research is purely scientific works and can bring unimaginable development for us. Since only a few developed countries invest on space exploration and research, it should be carried on.
Essay 858:
The overwhelming budget for arts, museums and galleries is often criticised by a group of people and they advocate the need of this money on more pressing issues like hunger, poor health care, and terrorism. They also opine that people who have enthusiasm for such arts  should bear the expenses. I believe that arts and museums are part of the enlightened world and they reflect the identity of a country. Hence the spending by the government in arts is quite logical.
To begin with, museums preserve the history and they have great educational values. They attract a huge number of foreign visitors and bring foreign currency for a country. For instance, the British Museum in London alone attracts more than 6.8 million visitors annually and this brings a lot of foreigners in London as well. Furthermore, a large number of art galleries and theatres are the reason people find visiting the UK a unique experience. They would  not have been here if the UK did not have these attractions. On top of that, visual arts, performing arts and other art forms reflect the unique heritage and culture the United Kingdom has. They convey our strength, tell our history and preserve our culture.
Human minds crave for arts and without arts, science would become too technical to the mass  people to enjoy. For instance, the incredible powers of computers do not only solve complex mathematical equations, but also create animations, graphics and other forms of arts for people to enjoy.
In summary, people need arts as much as they need science. Only food cannot ensure better living as we need to get engages in creative activities and yield artworks. In my opinion, the works of Thomas Hudson are no less important than the works of any scientists. So the government's funding for different forms of arts and museums is totally justified.
Essay 859:
People nowadays suffer from work-related stress and the increasing competition and need for extra earning to support the family have already made their life quite nonchalant and hectic. Entertainment and leisure activities are important parts of our overall wellbeing and for a better lifestyle and increased productivity government should allocate budget to promote such activities.
Firstly, it might seem quite logical that when a government already has the scarcity of budget for important sectors like education, healthcare, transportation, trade and agriculture how come extra money could be allocated for leisure and entertainment activities. But there is no denying the fact that entertainment and leisure activities have an immense effect on our physiological and psychological well-being. A small amount of money subsidized for entertainment can actually save a huge amount from health care sector. Thus subsiding budget for the amusement and leisure activities for people is actually a beneficial idea.
Secondly, governments in most of the countries already subsidize a large amount of money for amusement and leisure activities of mass people. For instance, the parks, botanical and zoological gardens, public library, sports centre, swimming complexes, beaches etc we see around us are already financed by the government. From this regards, this is always a good idea for the government to provide facilities for leisure activities to its citizens. Thirdly, proper facilities of entertainment and free time activities are proven to be educative in many cases. For instance, libraries, museums and establishments like these are not only entertaining but also offer a huge opportunity to present educative information to the people.
Again, the government can actually earn money from these facilities. For instance, beaches, sports centres, theatres and auditoriums could be great sources of earning for the government if they are properly utilised. Finally, it is proven that free-time activities and entertainment facilities decrease the crime rate in a locality. Thus investing in public activities would actually bring a huge benefit for the government and the country.
To end the discussion, I quite agree that allocating budget for the leisure and enjoyment of people is quite a prudent idea and every government around the world should do that for the overall benefits of the country and the citizens.
Essay 860:
Many individuals think that education helps to go through poverty and starvation around the world. However, there is an opposite view that food aid is the most important to deal with it. I firmly believe that both education and food aid are helpful in solving this problem.
There is no doubt that education can help poor people become wealthier and be able to provide themselves, for example, buy groceries and pay bills. This happens because after school graduation teenagers are able to find only low payable jobs and most of them cannot cover their bills or buy enough food to survive. For this reason, many people go to University to study. Moreover, in the highly competitive business environment after completing degree most of the graduates can find better jobs with higher income rather than they were able to do after school. Also, there is no end of tertiary education as people can do a masters degree and the salary of those will increase gradually. All these examples are the sufficient evidence that education is a major source of obtaining wealthy lifestyle. To develop and progress as a nation, the citizens must be educated. The globalisation has made it possible to live and work in any country but to do so someone has to be educated and skilled. The migrated people also send a huge sum of revenue that helps the country to develop. Hence to alleviate the poverty and hunger, education is the key. In terms of fighting the hunger and poverty globally, education helps to make the people be skilled and more efficient. For instance, an educated farmer has far more potential to contribute to producing more crops than an uneducated farmer. The Same rule applies in all other sectors as well.
The next point that needs to be taken into consideration is that food aid obviously helps to tackle starvation over the world because it is the first necessary thing to do when people are hungry. For example, there are places in Africa where individuals are dying from hunger because there is no food and job prospect there.  For this reason, food aid is vital in helping those and after that ensuring education and training could be helpful. Education is not achieved overnight and to educate a generation in a country needs a huge budget. On the contrary, people are dying from hunger and scarcity of food. Those people need immediate aid and the education could be a long term vision to make them self-reliant.
To sum up, although some group of people argue education is the most crucial to deal with starvation and others believe that the food aid is the way to solve this issue, I would argue that the combination of both are required to support hungry people around the world.
Essay 861:
People have begun facing more challenges in their life as the world is always transforming into a more modern one where human beings have to deal with an increasing number of competitions to survive. Consequently, longer time must be spent for working. I do agree that this will lead to declines in the number of hours spent for families or even leisure activities. For some people, this can really be frustrating, while others can still enjoy this condition.
There are three reasons why some people experience more working time today. Firstly, the economic or financial condition will force those whose income is still low and need supports from other livelihood or longer time in the same job. Secondly, some people also perform a great number of activities every day as a lifestyle because they really love their jobs. Thirdly, as responsibilities they bear, people in some areas such as arms have to deal with every consequence even if they are needed to take part in a war raging for a certain or uncertain period of time.
However, the effects of this situation where working hours are more are not always worse. For those who do this because of a low financial condition when they must work under a stressful condition even when their employers are very strict and unfriendly, this is truly desperate for both themselves and their families. In contrast, for those with the remaining two reasons, it is apparently to be fascinating because they work as they love their jobs or as their responsibilities for other people such as their countries, which in turn can bring them and their families some tremendous satisfaction or pride even though they should inescapably feel or enjoy less time together.
Regarding this, in my perspective, considering what kinds of jobs we like to do and being prepared for that can help us to be more independent while choosing any livelihoods. By doing this, everyone can find them always fun as his or her lifestyle.
All in all, despite the increasing working hours experienced by many people nowadays which will cause less togetherness with families as well as the lack of leisure activities, we can deal with this by preparing a better future since the very beginning so that more opportunities and choices will open.
Essay 862:
It is true that wearing brand clothes has been becoming a usual habit in many communities. People are always encouraged by propagandas to purchase more fashion goods far more than in the past. I personally believe that the negative consequences of this lifestyle surpass its probable advantages.
Obviously, citizens are continuously pushed to use more fashion because of two important reasons. The first one is the positive role of advertisement. Before, the only devices for advertising of a product were television and radio; however, now individuals are constantly exposed to a variety of commercials shown on the Internet, inducing them to buy more clothing being designed recently. In particular, as users are searching on Google, they unconsciously see different advertisements shown by different companies on the each side of the page. Therefore, they are tempted to watch the related page more and purchase shoes, shirts or other clothing. Another factor is that consumers have access to more variation of styles and brands than before. Obviously, competition between different international companies has led them to generate more different brands with specific logos. As a prime example, while only Adidas, Nike, Puma or Reebok were the leading sportswear by the year 1990, more different sports clothing have been allowed to be produced with different names after that time, like Columbia or Asics. As a result, users have more options to select their favourite clothes and change their interest based on the latest model.
From my point of view, this way of living can and will have more drawbacks. The first reason behind it is that individuals may forget the quality. Clearly, considering which materials are used in a dress can be far important than its name. For instance, we may pay just over $100 for a Dolce & Gabbana shirt, which is almost five times we have to pay for a CHAPS one, whereas the quality and longevity of the latter could be far better than the former. In addition, the rate of consumerism has grown far considerably. Citizens are exposed to more fashion goods, causing them to spend more money on unnecessary items. In this case, some youth are used to wearing varied shoes instead of only one, but they cannot even afford their medical or dental expenditure.
In conclusion, broadcasting and producing of more different merchandise are the two crucial factors why individuals prefer to use fashion. This has increased consumerism, and the quality of products has gradually been forgotten.
Essay 864:
Nowadays, urbanisation has changed people’s lifestyle thoroughly. Those living in suburbs or rural areas have gradually moved into central cities to find better opportunities, not only for a job but for accommodation, better life and advanced facilities. From my point of view, this modification has had more drawbacks to communities.
To begin with, two important reasons have led individuals to select sprawling cities as the best places for living. One is that they are more to find better job positions. Clearly, the branches of many multinational companies are located in large cities than in small cities. For example, a fresh computer graduate living in a small village of the USA is rarely able to find an appropriate career in his place, while by moving and living in Los Angeles, he will be able to apply for IBM, HP, Microsoft or other international corporations. Another benefit is that they can have a better lifestyle. Obviously, urban inhabitants can have more options to inhabit, like living in skyscrapers or luxurious huge mansions which might not be found in suburb areas. The advancement of technology and modernisation are fewer in rural areas than those in the city. Finally factories, industries and other companies also attract labours and blue collar job seekers and that’s another reason many people move to large cities.   
This migration trend has changed the social structure and the economy of cities. The cities are expanding faster and the increasing population are also creating many issues that were rare in the past. The huge population from different ethnicity, educational status and religion has created a mixed culture in the cities. Apart from the positive aspects, this mixed culture offers, many social and environmental problems are also being created because of that.
In my view, this change of living condition has had more negative consequences than having more probable advantages. One obvious disadvantage is raising the density of air pollutants in cities. Unfortunately, using more private cars in metropolitan, dwellers are faced numerous heart and lung problems. In particular, had the government of Tehran, the capital of Iran, prohibited migration of rural people there, the rate of morbidity and mortality would have dropped fundamentally since last three decades. According to medical officials’ report, just over 40000 of humans in Tehran died because of air pollution in 2014. Furthermore, traffic congestion has been deteriorated in urban areas. Admittedly, as the population grew, more private cars were to be used, leading traffic loads inflated far considerably and causing people to have more stress. However, controlling of immigration of villagers could reduce traffic jams, and citizens had less tension in their daily life.
To sum up, although displacement of humans into major urban areas has had some credible benefits, its negative influences must not be forgotten. Increasing the density of air emissions and traffic congestion are the two prominent consequences that have jeopardised city dwellers’ lives because of mass immigration.
Essay 865:
It is true that people’s tendency to see films is decreasing in some places of the world. This essay examines the various reasons of this trend and tries to propose practical solutions for this menace towards film industry.
To begin with, people have no sufficient free time to do their leisure activities as they are busy with their responsibilities: both professional and individual. For example, most of the people in India are doing full- time jobs without a break to meet their increasing economic needs for the family. Therefore, they may not get chances for enjoying cinema with their family or friends. Moreover, quality of the film is another important reason. To explain, some filmmakers do some compromises in different sections such as casting, editing and visual effects, while making new films and create poor quality movies. Such type of movies makes boredom for the audience very easily and as a result, they have no interest to watch these. For all these reasons, cinema attendance is declining a greater extent in some nations. The availability of Smart TV, internet and computer has made it possible to enjoy movies at home and that is another reason people do not want to visit cinema often.
However, there are several methods to tackle this issue effectively. Firstly, the government should reduce working load of people and make sure enough entertainment facilities for them in order to improve film attendance rate. In addition to that, the cost of film tickets should be reduced which would be helpful for ordinary people to buy film tickets from film theatres. Furthermore, all films should meet the basic standard to assure the quality. To be clear, standard films would be a visual treat for audiences and would also motivate them to watch again. By doing these methods issue can be solved to a certain extent.
Although, cinema is becoming increasingly popular all over the world, but the result of a recent research reveals a downward trend cinema viewers affecting many countries in relation to this. This essay will discuss both causes of this trend and will propose a solution to solve this problem.
Firstly, one of the main causes for the number of cinema goers to decline is the easy and fast internet access. Unlimited movie download facility from the Internet as well as watching it online is giving people the opportunity to watch their favourite movies at homes. ‘Globalization and popularity of foreign movies’ are two other reasons why people do not go to movie theatres to watch local-made movies. The quality of local-made movies has declined in many countries and that’s why many people think it does not worth to go to the cinema hall to watch a movie.  
There are some small measures that could be taken to decrease the sensitivity of this issue, restriction on Internet providers for free online movie videos could be an effective measure. Movies are copyrighted and the unlawful access to copyrighted materials for free should be controlled. In particular, the film industry can register a police report against online service providers for illegal copyrights of the original movies and free access to watch these. The quality of local movies should be enhanced to attract more people to watch it in the cinema halls.
It is believed that the number of people who watch films in cinema has been declining in the past few years. The following essay will discuss in details about reasons why it is decreasing, and some action plans that could be taken to resolve the issue.
For a number of reasons, the number of people who go to the cinema has been declining nowadays. Firstly, it is due to home theatre system become more affordable these days. As many electronic retailers offer various kinds of discounts or instalment programs, a lot of people own home theatre devices nowadays, and they choose to watch films at home. Secondly, it is because pirate films are sold freely in some countries, mostly in third world countries. Illegal retailers offer various kinds of movies, from drama, cartoon, action and even ethnic films and the price of these pirate films is very affordable. As a result, the public would choose to buy these films rather than going to the cinema.
However, there are several things that the government and people could do to solve the problem. The government should have strict and proper regulations about selling illegal films. Illegal retailers should be closed and the owner should be punished in accordance with the valid regulation. People who purchase or own illegal films should also be given some detentions as well. As for cinema owners, they should have some innovations or upgrade their cinema buildings. For example, they could convert the existing cinema into a 3D cinema and upgrade the sound system to a newer version, as they would attract more visitors.
In conclusion, cinema attendances are declining lately, because more people are owning home theatres system and choose to buy illegal films. To solve the issue, cinema owner should upgrade their theatres and the government should make a proper regulation about pirated films.
Essay 866:
Entertainment is an important and essential tool in everyone’s life today. Cinema and music are the most effective means of relaxation and entertainment in people’s life. They put off the stress of the people. After a hectic day in the office, one feels burden off only when he watches the television or his favourite film. However, nowadays there is a decline in people who is watching cinemas in the theatre. There are some important reasons for this cause. I will illustrate them along with the measures to solve the issue in the following phrases.
In the first, the main cause for the decline in the number of people watching cinema is the arousal of piracy at peak level in the community. One feels that it is merely a waste of money to watch the film in the theatre when he can watch it for free or at a low price in the computer or in television by using the pirated DVD or CD. Secondly, people find it boring to watch the same routine stories; there are no new concepts and new messages being conveyed by the cinema.
People nowadays are very busy with their daily life. Many of them prefer to stay at home to relax rather than watching a movie on the weekends. However, there are also reasons like the raised prices of the cinema tickets wherein people of all classes cannot afford it.
However, measures like strict government rules for the eradication of the piracy must be implemented; seizing off the internet centres and other online centres for selling the pirated DVDs and CDs. Film industry must come up with new innovative concepts showing the advancement in technology, the life history of great leaders, historical stories and stories relating to the woman development and empowerment. Cinemas must show the reflection of the real life along with the entertainment they provide us. Furthermore, expense on film tickets must be liberalised so that everyone can watch the film. In addition, quality of the movies should be raised and there must be some standards set for the movies so that people of all the age group film comfortable to watch it.
In the past, going to the cinema was one of the commonest ways to spend one’s free time. However, nowadays, in some nations, this is not the case anymore. This essay will suggest that the root causes for this phenomenon are poor local film industry and the high cost of cinema tickets. Thus, the solutions will be to improve the movies’ quality and making the fee payable by all the population.
The principle reason for the decline in cinema attendance in some countries is the poor local movie quality. Today, the main target for any film industry in these countries is only to gain some money, instead of entertaining the audience. Thus, they tend to hire inexperienced actors and use cheap resources, so that they pay less and hence, gain more. Another reason to mention is that the tickets are being even more expensive than before, which restricts the attendance to rich people, while even medium-classed population cannot afford its costs.
The most practical solution to tackle this issue is to enhance the quality of film industry. Filmmakers can hire well-experienced actors and actresses, and pay more in production and advertising. This will increase the attendance and in turn, will increase the profits. The government can also help by buying international movies like Hollywood movies. One other important measure to increase numbers of the audience is to lower the costs of attendance, so as to make it accessible to all population regardless of their ability to pay.   
To summarise, the decline in cinema attendance has become a widespread problem in some countries. Bad quality of local film industry is one of the most important causes, but fortunately, there are many ways to improve this situation. So, this problem is expected to be solved in the coming years.
Cinema was one of the major entertainment sources during the 20th century, across the globe. The current trend indicates that the number of people watching films in a cinema hall is reducing in many countries. This essay will demonstrate the causes for this change and will provide the possible solutions.
It is apparent that work pressure is increasing day by day due to competition. As people spend more time at their job, they have less time for entertainment. For instance, in Asian countries like India, Singapore etc. employees work around 10 hours a day due to their work requirement. In addition to that, they spend 1 to 2 hours on average for travel. They hardly get spare times to enjoy movies. Thus it is obvious that in some areas, people do not get enough opportunity to enjoy movies. This can be solved by restricting the work to maximum 8 hours a day. Both the government and the companies should come up with a policy that the workforce is never exploited.
Another important reason why some citizens do not have the interest in cinemas is due to its focus on less interesting issues. For example, most of the current South Asian movies just gravitate towards money spending and give less importance to stories or theme. After watching the film, there is nothing to study or accept from. By analysing how film industry concentrates on illegitimate factors, it is clear that the youth is definitely distancing from movies and switching to games in some nations. One way to get rid of this problem is to focus on the issue which the people enjoy. As the interest change from region to region, it is up to the regional film industry to recognise the demand for that area.
As a conclusion, it is apparent that by taking some measures, by government and industries, definitely cinema viewers can be increased. As a result, the film industry can use this as a mean of creating social awareness.
The creation of cinema has led it to become one of the major entertainment activities during the 20th century across the globe. However, the current trend indicates that the numbers of people watching films in cinemas have reduced in several nations. This essay will illustrate the causes of this change and will suggest some possible solutions.
It is apparent that work pressure is increasing day by day due to the competitive nature of employees. As people spend more time at their jobs, they have less time for entertainment. For instance, in Asian countries such as India and Singapore, employees work around 10 hours a day as mandated by their employers. In addition to that, they spend 1 to 2 hours on average commuting daily. They hardly get spare time to enjoy watching movies. Thus it is obvious that in some societies, people do not get enough opportunity to enjoy movies. This can be solved by restricting work to a maximum of 8 hours a day. Both the government and the employers should come up with a policy that ensures that the workforce is never exploited.
Another important reason why some citizens lack interest in going to cinemas is due to the movies focus on unimportant issues. For example, currently, most South Asian movies just gravitate towards making revenue and give less importance to storylines or themes. After watching a film, there is nothing worth studying or accepting from it. By analysing how the film industry concentrates on the wrong aspects of movie making, it is clear why youths are definitely distancing themselves from movies and switching to playing video games in some nations. One way to get rid of this problem is to improve on the aspects which people enjoy, such as storylines or themes. As audience interests differ from region to region, it is up to the regional film industry to identify the demand of their area.
As a conclusion, it is apparent that if some measures are taken by governments and industries, cinema attendance can definitely be increased. As a result, the industry can use this as a means of creating social awareness by incorporating important themes in the movies.
Essay 867:
Nowadays, the numbers of people who face health problems have increased rapidly due to modern lifestyles. There are various reasons which have caused the situation, and the following essay will discuss the issue and how to address it.
For a number of reasons, many people are facing serious health issues due to the modern lifestyle. Firstly, due to the globalisation, people have a longer working hour these days and consequently, they do not have or have a limited amount time for doing exercises. As a result, many employees are facing health problems such as high blood pressure and diabetic. Secondly, due to the high volume of work, many people are consuming instant food nowadays. Many scientists have proven that these instant foods are considered as unhealthy, as it could trigger some serious threat to the human's body, such as tumour or cancer.
There are things that people could do to avoid these unhealthy lifestyles. One of the things that people could do in their workplace is by doing some light exercises at the office. For instance, they could take the stairs instead of riding the elevator. And then, they could change their diet pattern, by bringing healthy foods from home, instead of dining at a fast food restaurant. And last but not least, people could consider in changing their mode of transportations. Instead of using their motor vehicle to work, they could ride a bicycle. Riding a bike is not just a simple and healthy exercise, but it also reduces the air pollution as well.
In conclusion, it is a fact that many people have problems with their health condition due to the modern world. It is mostly due to longer working hours and unhealthy diet patterns. However, these problems could be solved if people change their lifestyles, such as by stop consuming junk foods and bring healthy foods from their home or doing some light exercises at the office. Once they change their lifestyles, I am sure that their health condition would improve.  
Essay 869:
It is a fact that people are becoming more consumptive and materialistic these days, as many of them purchase luxurious goods or things that they do not really need and debts are common among such people. There are various reasons that have caused the situation and the following essay will discuss them and some of the things that people could do to address the problem.
For a number of reasons, many people are facing debt problem nowadays due to the consumptive lifestyles. Firstly, with the existence of social media such as Facebook or Instagram, more people are showing off their luxurious goods, take some photos and upload them into the applications and it triggers them to buy fancy stuff.  Secondly, with the significant growth in the number of elite malls, they attract people in spending more money on secondary needs such as fashion, jewellery or gadgets. And lastly, as applying and obtaining credit cards are easier these days, many people are buying expensive things which are greater than their income. As a consequence of this hedonism lifestyle, many people are ended up with a serious problem of debts.
There are several things that people could do to solve the problem. One of them is that there should be a clear regulation about credit cards that must be followed by banks and financial institutions, regarding the procedure of issuing credit cards to their consumers. It must be ensured that the credit limit that is given to credit card holders is aligned with the individual’s income. And then, instead of adding more malls in the city, the government should focus on building more public parks and children playgrounds. Therefore, people would have more options for entertainments besides going to the shopping centres.
In conclusion, it is true that a lot of people are having debt problems, as they purchase luxurious stuff and having fancy lifestyles. Some of the factors that trigger the problem are due to the effect of social media, the increasing number of shopping malls and the easier procedure in obtaining credit cards. And to solve the issue, the government should make a better regulation about credit card usage and build more public facilities; therefore people have more alternative places to visit beside malls.
Essay 870:
Nowadays, as a result of economic growth, the incomes of people are increasing and they start to consume more goods than the past. However, some people get to be in debt because of buying goods, which they do not actually need and could not pay. In my opinion, it is very important to prevent people from getting trapped in this problem.
In the first place, there are several reasons for this behaviour. One of the most important catalysts is the psychological problem. For instance, when some people are upset and disappointed, they tend to go shopping and buy everything they want. In this situation, because of their loose of control, they could not consider the things whether they need or not. Equally important, another reason is their temporary desire. To specify, at some moments, people always have the ambition to possess something, which is not normally necessary for them and out of their financial situation. Therefore, they will make a purchasing decision without assessing the benefits and drawbacks. Credit cards, purchase cards, gift cards etc. are more available nowadays and having a credit card from a band is easier than ever before. These shorts of cards and loans allure people to purchase more luxury items they can live without. While repaying, people get trapped and the high-interest rates increase the loan amount significantly.   
Admittedly, this behaviour could bring people into a very dangerous situation. Hence, the government, as well as the community, should take place some solutions to deal with it. Firstly, every store or shopping centre should control their customer purchasing by checking their financial status. As a consequence, it will restrict people in buying the items, which they cannot afford. Moreover, we should organise some psychological course for people, who have problems with shopping. Lastly, the sale staffs of shops should advise and give a good recommendation to their, which enable them to have the best choice. Banks should be more rigid while approving the credit card to a person and the credit limit should be within the affordable amount by the card holder.
In summary, to avoid getting into debt, everyone should consider both advantages and disadvantages of the products before buying it. Someone should not simply purchase a product because of pure luxury or pride. The repayment should also be considered at the time of purchasing.
Buying unnecessary things despite some people's financial limitation and getting into debt have affected our society severely. There may be various reasons for this attitude, but in my opinion, competition, social tradition, greed, marketing tactics, and materialistic expectation are the influencing factors for such a trend.  Prudent thinking, positive mentality and some laws can prevent it. 
Firstly, some people feel an invisible competition and they try to prove their superiority by having more and thus made a habit of showing off. For instances, if someone buys a latest electronic gadget, many others, who feel the invisible competition, might get frustrated for not having the latest model. Many of them would actually buy the latest model just to be ahead of the competition. Sometimes, they will borrow from others to have those materialistic greed fulfilled. Thus they get into debts and cannot purchase things that they really need at a time.
Secondly, in countries like India and Nepal, dowry system still persists and in many cases, bride's parents are compelled to take a loan and fulfil bride-groom parents’ demand. Besides, social trends often force people to maintain a lifestyle that they cannot afford, and those people are forced to get trapped in debts. Again, personal greed to own more and to have more often allure people to purchase things that they do not need and borrow money from others. Marketing tactics are meant to attract as many customers as possible and we are surrounded by marketing and it is quite tough for us to be prudent while purchasing. Finally, easy bank loans for fulfilling different needs can often trap people to fall in debts.
Reasons for our getting into debts explained above are deeply rooted in our society and have affected peace and harmony of many families. People should give up useless competitions and be contented with whatever they can afford rather than trying to have a lifestyle that they cannot manage. Government and concerned authority should make strict laws to abolish dowry system and bank loans should be made more rigid. Finally, our personal realisation is the most important factor to prevent ourselves getting trapped in debts by purchasing things we do not need. This is a personal choice and no one is going to stop us from purchasing unnecessary things unless we develop a self-realisation.
In conclusion, too much attraction towards materialism and competition bounds us to buy unnecessary things and there are proper measures to control this abominable habit and self-realisation is the most important one.
Essay 872:
It is true that technological devices such as surveillance video or mobile phone are utilised for monitoring public activities these days. In the most common case, many people do not realise that they are being monitored. Although the existence of these devices has some drawbacks, I do believe that it has more benefits for our communities and the following essay will discuss it in details.
On the one hand, it is reported the usage of technological tools has increased, such as video cameras that are placed everywhere by authorities and the tracking of individuals' cellular phone using satellite technology. These acts are unfavourable for some people since authorities do not inform their residents about the activities. Some people believe that this is against human rights and freedom, where people should have their own privacy. Besides that, this monitoring data could be misused by the member of the authorities, as the data could be sold to another party for business or political purposes.
On the other hand, the existence of CCTV in public places and satellite tracking of mobile phones would bring many advantages for the humankind if they are used appropriately. With the existence of these video monitoring activities, it would help the police department in preventing and investigating any crime activities. And then, with the sophisticated satellite tracking technology, it could help authorities in tracing crime persons, as they could search the existence of criminals through the signal of mobile phones. It has been proven that with the usage of these sophisticated technologies, it has reduced the number of crimes in many countries.
In conclusion, it is common that governments use advanced technology devices such as video camera and handphone tracking system to monitor their residents' activities. And in common cases, these monitoring activities are not informed and socialised to the public, therefore some people believe that they are against human's privacy policy. In my personal opinion, I do believe that these activities have more positive sides than its negatives if authorities use it properly.
Essay 873:
In today’s modern world, technology has developed at a fast pace and undoubtedly, it brings a handful of benefits but at the same time, it still has disadvantages like making the monitoring of what people are saying and doing. The essay will examine both sides of the issue.
The advanced technology nowadays makes people feel insecure as tracking process is made to be simple for people to monitor their friends or family members. Those who are being monitored may not aware of that this is happening and this leads to some issues related to personal privacy arrived. For instance, we constantly bombarded with the news that some couples will use this technology to track their couples through the electronic devices. Therefore, people may feel stress as they are afraid of being the next target of being monitored by others through cell phone tracking.
Nevertheless, the developed technology does bring numerous advantages. To begin, this technology like security cameras can help to prevent crime from happening. Thus, the crime rate will be reduced. The police nowadays like to use the security cameras wisely to monitor the would-be offenders and take effective actions towards them immediately. On the other hand, this useful technology enables the children to keep track with their elderly parents for the reason to ensure that they are safe. By using this technology intelligently, children can take immediate actions whenever their parents need help or in danger. In other words, children can take care of their parents’ safety before things get worse. As a result, we can see that most of the children today will definitely buy their parents a smartphone with a tracking application installed.
In conclusion, I believe the advantages of this development do outweigh the disadvantages. Even though there is a negative impact on people lives that is being monitored by others through cell phones, there are some benefits as well. Not forgetting to mention that a coin has both sides, if we can utilise this technology in an intelligent manner, we will surely get benefited and our country will continue to prosper and flourish in the decades to come.
Essay 874:
As the mankind has progressed, the technology has advanced as well. From the telephone which was invented by Graham bell in the 19th century to the iPhone invented by Steve Jobs in the 21st century, we have made a lot of progress in terms of technology. As a result of this revolution in technology, more and more gadgets are being used to monitor people. However, such monitoring has both positives and negatives when it comes to the end result.
CCTV cameras are quite mundane in shops, malls, etc and they help the bosses keep an eye on their employees. As a direct result, the employees, being aware of the monitoring, work efficiently. In a travelling job, the bosses can track their employees via GPS and thereby prevents false report-ins. Moreover, shoplifting is also often either averted or the shoplifter gets caught from the CCTV tapes.
In spite of the advantages of monitoring people using technology, there are cases where such monitoring may cause problems. CCTVs are often installed in trial rooms to prevent shoplifting. However, a person may unknowingly end up naked on tape while trying an apparel. With regard to an employee, continuous monitoring may lead to him/her not enjoying work and ultimately quitting, to work in a more relaxed environment. In addition to this, tracking once it is known, is being done, and becomes vulnerable. Consequently, the original source can be manipulated, erased or made public.
However, I still feel that monitoring by technology, despite its drawbacks has more pros than cons. Monitoring, at public places, can help provide safety and security to people. Police and other security personnel can track mobile phone conversations of suspects without them being aware and can, therefore, prevent crime. Camera footage from a crime site may help the police nab a gangster and the same tape can be used for his conviction.
In conclusion, the advantages of monitoring people via technology outweigh the disadvantages. However, steps need to be taken to ensure that there is no harm to the privacy and integrity of people while monitoring them even when they do not know, that they are being monitored.
Essay 875:
It is true that the technology of monitoring people would violate the privacy of individuals. Citizens have no private room and can't keep their secrets, which would undermine the quality of their daily life significantly. No matter where they go and who they meet, all of them are exposed under the monitoring of others. Furthermore, some people are even unaware of that they are under monitoring. It renders some outlaws take advantage of these technologies and then commit some serious crime to the innocent people, for example, tracking, committing fraud, even murdering. People are placed in a very passive position because they don't know they are monitored by the state of the art devices.
Despite the argument above, the monitoring technology can lead to the positive result as long as we can oversee and control it properly. It can be used to monitor some sensitive locations with high crime rate by our police. There are many instances in our real life that real-time monitoring can help police to prevent crime from happening as they can monitor some specific spots all the time. For instance, once suspects show up under the camera, the police can take prompt action to bust them in advance so that no one gets hurt during the action. Nevertheless, making good use of the monitoring technology has to ensure all of them are under control of our authority rather than criminals.
To sum up, although this development has some potential drawbacks like being used by criminal to commit crimes and violate the privacy of individuals,  we can make use of it to help us to prevent crime from happening as long as we ensure all of them are under our control.
Technology provides a valuable, almost indispensable aid to our daily living.  It helps us saving time, remembering things, being more efficient and safer. It is thus a logical consequence that it is utilised as a tool to monitor social behaviour, in order to prevent or restrain situations that could cause harm to others.
This is indeed the main argument used by those who are in favour of the monitoring use of technology. Tracking phone calls and text messages could preventively stop terrorist attacks, uncover instances of state corruption, and help to investigate crimes. Security cameras have been proven to be an effective small-crime deterrent and allow citizens to move around the city without the constant fear of been robbed, pickpocketed or assaulted.
We have to consider, however, that technology is yet not self-sufficient and can only provide a set of data that needs to be interpreted and checked by a human operator. The human factor, as any human factors, will, in turn, belong to a societal web and will, as Foucault would put it, follow a specific, pre-ordered, hierarchy of power. The point at stake here is then not really if we do benefit from the monitoring use of technology, which we surely do, but if such socio-normative and reprimanded apparatuses could not, in fact, be turned against personal freedoms and nurture the rise of totalitarianism. George Orwell's famous novel "1984" provides a dystopic picture of the effects born out of an excessive use of technology as a mean to monitor human lives.
In my opinion, technology provides an effective way of preventing and punishing deviant behaviours but could very well, at some point, be used to coerce individuals. For this not to happen, a scrupulous policy in regard to technological monitoring has to be effective at all times.
With the exponential growth of the technology in recent times, we are also seeing its wide and varied application in all walks of life one among it is to track the movements of people and their doings. This application can be a boon or a bane but in my view, the harmful effects outweigh the useful outcomes.
Firstly, increasing intrusion in one’s life events without consent is seen as a denial of privacy which is a fundamental right. This can be viewed as a major emotional setback as it happened in the case of phone tapping row in America which resulted in clashes between government and public. Not only it leads to distrust among people but also disturbed the social harmony which existed. Furthermore, the data collected by monitoring can be misused if it ends up in wrong hands. For example, people can use these data to extort money or events like ATM frauds and credit cards frauds or leakage of private images on the internet damaging the reputation of the concerned individual.
Although, one cannot deny that these activities of surveillance by designated authorities can prevent any attack on humanity by antisocial elements like terrorists thus maintaining peace and harmony in the society. Moreover, these kinds of monitoring at a certain level can be used by the employers for employee appraisal by knowing the right candidate deserving rewards for his hard work.
To conclude, as every coin has two sides similarly use of technology to keep track of people also has its own advantages and disadvantages though in my opinion disadvantages outweigh advantages by a small margin.
Essay 876:
Nowadays, the advancement of technology has immensely catalysed the improvements in our day to day experiences. Technology plays many vital roles in the fields of medicine, industrial science, research, and telecommunications. Additionally, these technological advancements are utilised by security agencies. Some are concerned that recording people's activities through the use of technology without their knowledge are against citizens’ privacy. In my view, this is of little concern compared to the many positive aspects this surveillance brings for us including protecting citizens from terrorists and detecting crimes.
Firstly, the implementation of technology, especially in establishments for the use of security, has helped in resolving crimes like theft. More and more companies take advantages of this by installing multiple CCTVs or surveillance cameras around their premises. Criminals who are unaware of these cameras are caught red handed in doing their mischief. In addition, surveillance cameras not only help solve the increasing crime rates but also aid in finding lost items and tracking down runaway pets by reviewing the recording of the previous days and even weeks or months. The sole objective of this monitoring system is to protect and detect crimes, not to violate people’s privacy. The criminals do not come from other planets. They live among us thus to detect them the security authority needs to monitors all citizens.  
The only disadvantage of the use of technology in this aspect is the violation of a person's privacy. Some individuals hold very high regard to protecting their personal space and would be dismayed to find out that they were recorded on a hidden camera. Because of this, there is a decreased amount of freedom that one has in doing some activities, most especially in public places.
In summary, technology has drastically improved our way of living and has greatly contributed to resolving the criminal cases around the vicinity. It is my deepest belief that there is more space for the development of technology which will absolutely defy the few disadvantages that this advancement brings.
Essay 877:
It is a fact that internet technology has helped people in connecting with their relatives and friends without the boundaries of distance and cost, but many people think that the technology has made people become less socialized and more individualistic. To a certain extent, I would agree that the internet has negatively affected to people's social life, but if we use the technology in a wise and appropriate manner, it has a lot of positive functions.
On the one hand, it is true that many people are having social life problems these days, due to the existence of internet and information technology. Almost everybody have their own mobile phone nowadays, and they can use it for browsing, chatting and online gaming.  With all the attractive and entertaining applications, many people like to play around with their gadget for hours and abandon their social life. As a result, it has been reported that many families are having communication problems these days due to they have less time for an eye to eye contact with other family members.  
However, it can be clearly seen that the problem has risen due to the improper and indiscipline act of users themselves. If the internet is used in the right purpose and in the appropriate portion, it would bring many benefits for mankind. Firstly, internet technology has truly changed the way individuals and corporations interact and correspond. With electronic email and chatting facilities such as yahoo or google, people could communicate and connected with other people in a more efficient and effective way. Secondly, the internet could also be used to expand people's networking. Social media sites such as Facebook or twitter could be used to connect people from different areas, maintain friendships and even it could be used for online businesses as well.  Therefore, it depends on of the users themselves on how wise they use it.
In conclusion, although online technology has become a problem for some people's social life, others disagree about it. To a certain point, I do believe that internet could be a treat to our social life, but if people use it wisely and appropriately then I do believe that it has a lot of benefits for individuals and societies.
Essay 878:
In today’s modern world, with the development of technology, we are able to communicate with people around the globe. However, some people assert that this advanced technology will not benefit us, in return, it will cause harmful effects on the way people socialise. Thus, we will examine both sides of the argument before reaching a reasonable conclusion.
Undoubtedly, people nowadays get benefited due to the advancement in technology, for example, internet. It allows people to communicate with others more easily and in a convenient manner. In the past days, the way people used to communicate was far more troublesome and time-consuming than that in the present day. That is, people could only write letters or send telegrams to keep in touch with their friends or relatives who live in the other part of the world. Nevertheless, internet which is available these days provides an opportunity for people to stay connected with others through social media like Facebook or email. Not forgetting to mention that, it only takes about a second for delivery and receive by their friends or family. Therefore, it is apparent that internet gives a golden chance to people worldwide to communicate with others which is impossible to achieve during the past decades.
On the other hand, there is always another side of a coin. The internet is believed to have detrimental side effects on the ability of people to socialise. To begin, internet at home causes the inhabitants of a city to stay at home whenever they are free. This kind of habit will cause them to lose the interpersonal skill which is crucial and should be mastered by every individual in their lives. They should, for instance, take part in youth or sports activities so that they can meet new friends and develop the socialising skill. If they do not learn how to communicate with others in face-to-face conversations, they are less likely to achieve success in their jobs which require the sophisticated communicating skills. Hence, it is clearly shown that people may eventually lose the ability of socialising if they overuse the internet.
In conclusion, the internet brings numerous advantages and disadvantages to our lives. However, I believe that we should spend our time wisely on using the internet as it can be more beneficial provided we do not overuse it and we should learn to socialise face-to-face rather than bury their heads into the screens of electronic gadgets.
Essay 879:
Today, developments in the cyber-space have revolutionised the way people to communicate. Although it has created better contact options to the users, they have less active relationships than the past, and I believe that this has caused people to become more isolated.
On the one hand, citizens are able to communicate better through the web in more different ways. The first is the expansion of social networks. Facebook, twitter or email are three familiar examples that have led all age groups to be able to communicate via their electronic devices. They can see their friends’ pictures, opinions or even their news shared on their page. In addition, trading has become more straightforward. Businesspersons can easily contact to their partners through the Internet via teleconference or Skype; however, in the past trading was not as simple as now, and traders only had to travel and meet their partners. As a result, electronic communication between the businesses has caused people to socially feel closer with each other.
On the other hand, innovations in telecommunication have caused humans to become more isolated socially. One reason is that they are used to have less face-to-face relationships. Had the Internet not developed so fast, people would have participated in more social gatherings. For example, twenty years ago, as a high school student, I and others peers were encouraged by our authorities to participate in weekly meetings to discuss educational, social or even personal issues, becoming more socially active, but now many students are interested less. Another reason is that cyber-addiction is a leading reason that citizens to feel less elated. Clearly, the more technology of smartphones develops, the more individuals will be engaged in more variety of applications and become more dependent on them. Therefore, they will spend less time on travelling, spending their time with their friends, becoming more secluded and desperate.
In conclusion, modernization has had some positive influences on humans’ relations. However, I personally believe that it has caused people to socially become less active due to spending longer hours on their computers and have less close communication with each other than before.
Essay 880:
In the modernised society advancement of technology has pertained new trends and it is being observed that various sources or modes of communication channel been evolved. Internet considered being one of the immense Innovative technologies. These avail people to connect with any part of the globe. The evolution of Internet makes each individual stay connected to their loved ones and also to socialise with different people from other parts of the world. These are more advantageous in day-to-day life and it had become one of the essences of human, which always stays connected rather isolated. Let's discuss the advantages of advancement in Internet technology and the impact which hooked the society.
Firstly, the Internet is meant to be one of the important inventions where human ever evolved. Most argue that the internet is considered to be one of the main sources in today's world. This makes people collaborate each other not only officially, but also emotionally. To illustrate further, for official related tasks it makes associates share their ideas globally and prevail helping to be connected. With the use of Internet, an individual can stay connected with different cultures and with different people around the globe. Moreover, the internet has made life easier when compare historically. For example, in olden days, if any messages or information needs to be passed, the only mode was human; then evolved the post, telephone and now instance mode of connecting is through the internet.
In addition to the above facts, it not only benefits officially, perhaps it stays connected emotionally. For instance, people who stay away from family and deputed outside the world can communicate with their family and chat video / audio based on the facility available through Internet. Alternatively, when compared to 10 years’ before trend, people can collaborate with same society and to a limited audience, but through Internet an individual can connect and socialise to any part of the Globe. These are one of the healthy ways of collaborating with different people around the globe. The impact has made enormous to communicate people and to learn different cultures and to understand the facts of each country. The Internet makes people create awareness of various globe threat diseases or any human illegal plans. For example, in recent days the globe threat disease Ebola which shaken the whole world, these has been reached various parts of the world and alert people to take immediate action to prevent the disease, this is believed to be with the help of Internet. People started posting alerts and preventive measures about the disease through social media through Internet.
Alternatively, the Internet has numerous impacts which have been proven and obstructed the society. The internet is one of the deadliest sources which can affect one country's economy. There are various hacking and facts behind hackers that should be admitted. The human evils can be spread through the internet.
In conclusion, socialising with people or not is individual's perspective. It resembles more of individual's characteristics rather than targeting the communication mode. The internet is one of the communication modes which facilitate to communicate globally in an efficient way rather than isolating with people. It is more of people's mindset than blaming on the technology. Most of the facts favour that the internet is most efficient way to socialise with people rather that impact.
Essay 881:
During the last two decade internet has made a huge advancement. This is very apparent when we look at the medium of communication of the recent past. Some people believe that this advancement has opened up avenues for socialisation. While others argue that due to the progress of the internet, individuals are becoming more self-centric. While I personally believe that the progress of the internet has made the earth a small place to live in and hence, it has catalysed the socialisation.
Firstly, due to the huge progress in technology along with the internet, we are never away from our loved ones. Just by a mere click of a button, we can connect with any person, who live in any corner of the world. For instance, using the internet we can make a Skype call to any individual whom we wish to connect. All we need is just an internet access. By using this "Skype", not only can we speak to that person, but also we can see him/her. Thus, with the internet, the world seems a smaller place.
Moreover, social networking sites are mushrooming on the internet. These sites are just meant for the purpose of socialisation. Take "Facebook" for example, where not only we can be in touch with our friends, but also we can share our day-to-day activity with our acquaintances. Hence, these "social networking sites" are one of the greatest mediums of connectivity and never isolate us from the rest of the world.
After analysing the above points, we can safely conclude that, if utilised well, the internet helps us in socialising. Also, it provides us with a great platform for being in touch with our loved ones. Looking at the positive impacts of the internet, it is also expected that, in the coming future its popularity will grow exponentially and more people will start using it as their primary medium of connectivity.
It is obvious that Information age brings speed to our life. Speed and easiness of the internet make it the most popular media in social affairs. “Social networks” concept has been redefined by the internet development.The internet connection type advocates are of the view that meanwhile, the internet links us together, it has not any side effect; I disagree with it.
First of all, the internet connection methods such as social networks encourage people not to visit each other physically. Their users gradually prefer to use cheap and available internet connection to find their relevance and friends instead of visiting each other in the real world. This may lead to reducing kindness between people. For example, children may rather send a birthday congratulation email to his/her old parents instead of visiting and embracing them. They may even send their birthday gift using gift websites.
Moreover, using this media for connecting to others, may addict their users. They overspend plenty of time in social networks, checking email, chatting, and etc. while they have necessary personal and professional works. They forget time behind their computers smart devices. Their performance had reduced in work; this may cause giving up their job. They also neglect their personal activities such as personal cares and doing house chores.
To conclude, although it is undeniable that the internet brings enormous useful services for us, I hold the view that using it as media for connecting world people are damaging in the current manner. I hope we can use the internet better and improve our relations quality.
Essay 882:
The development of technology has become faster and faster. The internet as one of the advanced technologies is believed by many people to make communication easier. Albeit, others think that the internet restricts people to socialise. In my point of view, I believe that the upsides of internet outstrip the downsides.
Firstly, the internet allows people to get in touch with their families, friends, and relatives who live or stay in other countries. For instance, some Asian students choose to study abroad. By the internet existence, they are able to interact and communicate with their families, even if they are limited by many miles away from their home. They can know about their parents' condition and share information about themselves using some features that are provided by the internet such as Facebook, Instagram, Skype, etc.
Secondly, by using the internet, people are able to share memories and information with people around the world. The internet makes communication easier, so people can recognise the conditions and situations in other countries. They can enrich their knowledge about world's issues and try to find solutions if it is needed. People do not have to go a certain country to find out what is happening there since the internet helps them to get anything.
Moreover, the internet allows people to make new friends and acquaintances. Hence, they will socialise with other people from different circumstances. This would lead people to have a good relationship with the citizen of the world and acknowledge about their cultures.
To sum up, I believe that the internet brings many benefits, mainly to allow people staying connected with each other no matter how far they are. The advantages outweigh the disadvantages that the internet brings along.
The internet has become an essential part of our life and it is hard not to underestimate its influence in modern society. However, it is a very complicated question to answer about its positive and negative sides in terms of people’s reaction towards it.
Nowadays it is particularly impossible to live without modern gadgets. New technologies are used in everyday life by millions of people around the world. Social relationships between us are getting easier with the help of mobiles and the internet. We may do everything online- buy things, do business, communicate with your friends, exchange your opinions with others. Even distant education in overseas countries is available on the internet. Everything you have to do is just to be connected to the global network. Apart from this, it opens wide fields for everyone who has ever used this helpful source of information and communication throughout the huge world. Social networks are getting more and more popular among young and middle-aged people, even elderly ones try to use this convenient means of communication.
Nevertheless, the role of the internet in many negative aspects of our life is crucial. We are becoming more involved in the virtual world, without understanding all side effects of its usage.Children play violent and cruel games on the internet, sitting in front of a computer for hours. They don’t know another reality, but the virtual one. It really makes them internet addicted since their early  years. Moreover, the number of crimes and suicides among teenagers has also grown dramatically. Violence, aggression, racial intolerance and lechery are altogether the dangerous companions of the modern World Wide Web. Despite all the statements about the global connection between people, owing to the internet, we can see that many of them are incapable of having a vivid communication with their relatives, neighbours and colleagues at work. A lot of families don’t spend their free time together anymore; they are separated by the internet from each other. In addition, many prefer to stay online the whole weekends and they really don’t care about surrounding reality.
To sum up, I would like to say that the internet is just a part of our life, like many other things and there will always be a lot of different judgements and opinions upon it. Furthermore, only we can do it better or worse for ourselves and our society in whole. It is full of advantages and disadvantages, as well as everything in this world, but it’s up to us to stay connected with others or to be isolated in its diverse and extensive area.
Essay 883:
Only around 30 years ago or so, it was hard for people to travel, because of the monetary problems or the difficulties to collect a wide range of documents needed. Nowadays, not only visiting, but living in the other countries are fairly usual and many students decide to take the degree at the foreign universities. However, does this allow them more benefits than drawbacks? Let’s discuss.
On the one hand, it happens that the student's home university may be not the best in the world in some fields of study. Hence, students won't be able to obtain the knowledge at the required level and become a highly professional at his future career. That is why students choose the universities with the positive reputation outside their own motherland.
On the other hand, some countries, as North Korea, count the living in the different countries as treachery. Leave the home area for studying means to show how bad the teaching is inside. It will result on the popularity of the country and thus, the tourism level. Also, usually, the period of learning at the university lasts from 3 to 7 years and by the time the person will graduate, he will get used to living abroad. Hence, bright and able professionals would forget its motherland, which will lower down its place in international levels even more.
In conclusion, I also want to study medicine in the foreign country, because the level of it in my home country is not that high and I wish it was better. For me, the advantages of studying abroad outweigh drawbacks. However, I do want the students to come back and help their home countries even in every way.
Essay 885:
The first reason is that people tend to clarify and identify the origin of their family to detect the characteristics of every member psychologically and biologically. In psychological view, we are claimed to have a similar character with other family members as well as a similar behaviour on how we face the problems. Moreover, biologically, it is clear that we get the character genetically from parents, then by observing and identifying this biological feature we are able to understand why we possess a certain character and how to change the character in future for the next offspring.
The second reason is that we face many criminal cases nowadays in terms of adopting children which give unclear identity for those children in the future when they are registered in migration office as well as when they are sent to the school. This condition gets some people to identify the history of the family to avoid the constraints in administration process in every place where they are. For example, they absolutely need the data of parent birth date as well as their valid address in making a family card. They then try to find out some information from people around them.
On the other hand, there are some people who believe that this action is merely a waste the time. There is no advantage to think more about the past or the history of a family. However, every person has his/her own pride to identify the characteristics of family members. We cannot deny that they are all memorable to be memorised forever. The most important thing is that we must respect the way people love their family.
Recently, in most countries, it has been becoming a trend finding the history of people's life, especially their family backgrounds. This trend can lead to several benefits for many aspects such as easing the employers to get a necessary employee, or collecting data of social ranges in the countries for further uses, or even preserving historical backgrounds among the nations. This essay, as my point of view lead to, will elaborate more about the reasons people doing this as I believe that this trend is a good improvement.
Firstly, how a family educates their children influences the way of thinking of the children in some ways. Besides, the beliefs the family holds and teaches the children will always be with the children. Thus the first school for the children is the house they live in. An employee with so scheduled activities can be related to the way to the way of his/her parents educating him/her. Relating to this, corporations take this indicator, the family backgrounds, as one of the considerations to select the applicants for appropriate positions.
Secondly, historians recognise this as an academic interest. They collect the information as much as they can attempt to gain perspectives of social, economy, and also culture from the society. They use this as the database to preserve the historical background to remind the young generations to not to forget about their own personal background family as well as to make several suggestion policies which are proper for the condition of the group of families inside the country for the government. As the result, there will be massive positive outcomes for both individuals and governments to deal with severe problems in society because the database includes beliefs, values, religions, and other relating things from the society.
Essay 886:
In today’s modern world, we are constantly bombarded with the issue of natural disasters happening around the globe. Thus, some people assert that preventing the occurrence of natural disasters is merely the responsibility of government as they believe they can do nothing in preventing it from happening. Nevertheless, I think that cooperation between people and government is essential in protecting citizens from natural disasters.
Undoubtedly, a government has the largest obligation to take the practical measures to prevent natural disasters from happening. They can, for example, employ those scientists and geologists to predict the time of occurrence of disasters. By knowing when there will be a natural disaster, the government can then take the effective prevention to mitigate the potentially dangerous effects on human lives. To illustrate, to tackle the problem of the tsunami which may cause the death of inhabitants, the government should allocate a portion of the money to improve the current drainage system and to build barriers near the sea-coast. Thus, it is apparent that government has more power to lower the potential risks of natural disasters from happening and its effects on the citizens.
However, it is not to say that citizens have no responsibility to protect themselves from natural disasters. They can take little but could prove useful ways in dealing with this problem. For instance, parents should educate their children from young to behave well by not simply throwing rubbish into the drains and rivers which may eventually cause blockage. This kind act is proved to be useful in preventing natural disasters like flooding. In addition, they should also take part in a campaign which gives information of what can be done by citizens in order to minimise the negative impacts of natural disasters on human beings. Although there are limited actions that an individual can take in dealing with this problem, the possible negative impacts on humans can still be reduced if every citizen plays their own part.
In conclusion, it is the responsibility of both government and individuals to mitigate the unanticipated impacts of natural disasters on human beings. I believe our nation will continue to prosper and flourish in the years to come and the citizens can be free from disasters.
Essay 887:
People have established a government to lead, guide, and care for the whole country. A government always knows its sworn responsibility and one of it is to assure the wellness and security of the citizenship from disasters, man-made or naturally caused. I agree that the government is responsible and accounted for keeping its citizens from natural disasters, to keep them informed and provide safety and rescue measures once a disaster had already occurred.
It is necessary for a certain individual to know what he should do in case of emergencies and so relevant information would serve as a vital role to save oneself from a disaster. The government should disperse information for the preparation of the entire community before catastrophe could happen. An example would be safety tips during and after an earthquake. As a student before, we were exposed into an earthquake drill so we were somehow taught what to do during an earthquake. So when a real earthquake occurred, we just stayed calm and did what we have practised.
Moreover, a government is also reliable to save the people injured so rescue facilities should be sent to places which have been affected. Trained professionals and volunteers, rescue mobiles, and other related rescue units are the appropriate ones to be dispatched. Like floods, which usually occur in most regions of our country, rescuers used to save the victims through rescue boats and retrieve them from their affected homes.
Essay 888:
Mass communication and transport are growing at a faster rate and provide an opportunity to become a change in international globalisation. Because of this incredible growth we have to limit the world, able to reach people in a smaller span of time and can see and roam all over the globe. Some people think this change is not good for their culture and are strongly against to it. In my opinion, change plays a vital role in someone's growth.
If we look at the history, we accepted many changes in our day to day life which made our life comfortable and easy to live. We are in the 21st century and we have a solution for almost everything. For example, a patient who is suffering from a severe disease and not getting a better treatment in one place, he would have the option to get treatment in another place, maybe in some other country. We get this information via internet, TV, news. This is how people are connected and helping each other to survive and excel in their life.
Yet to another part of above, a culture can not be represented by the dress someone wears, the language what someone speaks, It’s just a lifestyle which is acceptable by someone and help lead their life all with happiness. Though the human has different characteristic but they have the same emotions and feelings towards their own family member. They can act differently in some situation but the pain and sorrows are almost same in all human being because that's God given.
Therefore, I do not agree that mass communication and transport gives any negative impact on culture, it is someone's own perception and totally depends on them that what changes they like to embed in their life. Hence, criticising other culture and not giving human value can bring disaster and put us in soup.
Essay 889:
Recently, there is an ongoing debate about the significant impacts on the economy by thriving tourism industry create further severe problems in local cultures and environment. This essay, as my notion leads to, tries to elaborate this issue as I believe that problems created are inevitable.
Firstly, the tourists, whether they are foreigners or local ones, tend to disobey the cultural background of the tourism places. Even though they are well known about the surroundings habit, they consider themselves as guests who are supposed to be served by the local society paying no attentions to the native motives.
Secondly, they care less about the environment such as evergreens, rivers, beaches, etc. because they are aware of the government’s existence who has an obligation to maintain a quality environment. To be exact, they just throw the garbage away into inappropriate places. The local people get influenced by the way tourists dress and talk and they also adopt other foreign cultures that are threatening to the local culture. It is often observed that people in tourist area engage their children in work instead of sending them to school and that has a huge impact on the overall growth of the economy and future of a country, especially a third world country.  
Lastly, they together with stakeholders who are taking an interest, in this case, argue that this industry can lift the nation from economy problem through opening job opportunities or increasing the income of local citizens as well as the government revenue at the same time, but it seems to be irrelevant. The experts revealed that tourism may cause more expenditure in preserving the unique local cultures and also more expenses in taking care of the environment surrounding tourism places, and it costs more than how much a nation can afford from the industry.
Having considered all views above, it is fact that tourism sector has positive effects on the economy but the negative impacts are much higher to overcome by money gotten from this particular sector. Hopefully, governments and councils can regulate the industry by taking more concern in all aspects (economy, culture, and environment) to result in the maximum outcome.
These days, many of us believe that tourism can be regarded as one of the most contributive aspects for economic growth of the country. However, some of us still find some drawbacks of tourism because it can dilute our indigenous traditions and make people do not care about their environment. I agree with the notion that tourism can harm the local culture and its environment. In this essay, I will support my opinion with some reasons.
To begin with, we should open our eyes to the fact that tourism has lead to the great transformation of economic growth in our country. Many people around the world try to visit our country in order to know our cultures and enjoy the beautiful views of our country. This fact shows a number of advantages to our economic growth such as the growth of industrial aspects. However, this development can harm our indigenous cultures and environment.
Nowadays, the growth of tourism transformed our life to the different style of life. Compare to the past time, these days, a majority of the people have been influenced by the western culture. In the past time, the youth and elderly respected each other and still preserved the value of culture, and morality. Today, westernisation of culture happened and tried to interfere our lifestyle. The high values of culture and morality almost erased from the dictionary of society. People tend to forget their indigenous cultures and traditions, moreover, their offspring following the same. They no longer care about the upkeep of their cultures inheritance and trapped in the western cultures which identical with the nightclub, drinks, and party. Take Bangladesh as an example, in the past time, Bangladesh was very well-known with its traditional cultures. Presently, this country is changing and no longer known for their cultures.
It is true that tourism has become a significant source of the national budget for several countries over the world. Those countries concern and allocate more money to develop the tourism industry in achieving the bigger income as well as the satisfaction of tourists. However, some people show such kind of disagreements to this affirmative action by considering the effect of tourism to the local society culturally and environmentally. I personally believe that this agreement is not truly correct in because of several reasons. This essay aims to show my stance to support the development of tourism and provides several convincing arguments regarding this controversial issue.
The first reason is that tourism sector contributes such big income to the country through economic activities run by societies around the tourism places. It is clear that tourism is now becoming an industry that creates thousands of jobs for the citizen in terms of its management, protection as well as promotion. People who have skill in English probably would build a tour and travel business and become a guide. For those who have certain creativity or arts may sell their products of arts in a shop, or people might sell some soft drinks and snack to the tourists. These all economic activities crucially contribute to achieving the goal of government to provide job fields and to give the prosperity of society.
The second reason is that developing and promoting tourism object is the most effective way to broadcast the positive-country-image to the global society in order to attract them to come to those countries as tourists or even as investors. Moreover, going to beautiful tourism places has inevitably been a demand for people over the world and it is a kind of “golden chance” for every country to promote the best places in their regions. Let us take Bali Island as an example, which has been successfully promoted and being promoted as the image of a piece of paradise in Indonesia.
On the other hand, some local people tend to refuse the policy of the government in developing tourism. The reason is so simple because they consider the harms of tourism development that cause cultural loss and environmental damage. However, I believe that both cultural and environmental protection are the parts of tourism development on how government allocate the budget to tourism sector for creating a clean environment or ecotourism and promoting cultural tourism in which environment and culture are the basis of tourism.
Essay 890:
People have different views on whether parents should read or tell stories to children. From my point of view, this practice is more beneficial to children, although the opposite view does have some advantages.
It is undeniable that letting children read books by themselves would cultivate their independence. As they can explore the world of books by themselves, there is no restriction to their mind. Children can build up the ability of independent thinking in this way. Besides, more broaden information is available for children by this practice. Books, movies, TV have various information and some of them are very valuable knowledge. It is a good way for children to accumulate this knowledge with entertainment ways as they won't feel any pressure on it.
Despite above argument, the way of sharing or reading stories to children by their parents has more distinctive benefits. Parents can enhance the relationship with their children. For example, the time spent on reading stories together is memorable and meaningful to both parents and children and they can have an open discussion or free chat with each other. Another benefit is that parents can provide an appropriate guidance to their children so as to keep them away from some negative materials which are overwhelming in the media nowadays. It is essential for children to grow up with their parents' guidance.
To sum up, reading stories to children can enhance the intimacy between parents and children as well as provide some proper guidance, although letting children read by themselves can help them to build up their independence and acquire various knowledge from different channels.
The attitude of children towards the society is mainly based on the knowledge they get from books, TV and media. However, some think it is the responsibility of parents to read the stories to children, while others think children have the ability to read and understand the things on media, books by themselves. I will discuss both aspects in the below paragraphs.
Firstly, Parents are the first teacher to their kids. Parents are the one who will have a vast influence in moulding children for the betterment of their future. Parents can convey the right messages gathered from books, TV, media in a more precise way. Also, parents can broaden children's view by discussing various elements of life by telling stories. Furthermore, parents can teach more the efficient method of reading books and gathering information from the media. On the contrary, too much influence of parents develops a dependent attitude in children, which reduces the self-confidence in taking decisions. Children will also follow negative aspects of their parents as they are not getting enough opportunity to think in different directions.
Secondly, children develop a unique ability of self-decision and judgment if they are allowed to read books, watch TV, media. This self-dependence will have a positive impact on their academic carries. In addition, creativity and imagination will be moulded according to their experience and imagination. On the other hand, children will accept everything without knowing the positive and negative elements which will impact their personality and future.
To sum up, I opine that, both approaches have advantages and disadvantage but parents have more influence on the development of positive attitude in children by guiding them in each element. However, parents should act in such a way that, the learning and independent decision taking abilities of their children are not compromised.
Essay 891:
Some people believe that library should be made available to the public without entrance fee because new arising modern technology and internet access can already provide information resources. Nonetheless, most people will no longer visit the library. However, others argue that it should have an entrance and membership fee.
We can never deny those people who believe that library should impose entrance and membership fees to the public. The funds are needed for the maintenance of the facilities and purchasing of new books. Library is still important because it is a quiet place where people can read the books peacefully. Nowadays, there are various web pages on the internet that can provide similar information as in the library. Nevertheless, the convenience of the place is much more calming for the reader. The reader cannot concentrate on reading information on computer shop because of the noise from other users. It is widely true that information from the internet has several adverts, and it interrupts on comprehending the information. Therefore, the library is still important for the readers. It does not rely on electricity. It is conventional and boundless. There is not health and mental hazards on reading in the library that might happen due to excessive use of a computer.
However, some people point out that library should be free to users. It is widely believed that the aim of good governance is to educate certain people in the society. Public libraries should be made free and accessible to the majority of people. There are certain groups of people who want to acquire information; nonetheless, they are restricted because of the fine imposed in the library. For instance, the impoverished group is not given the opportunity to finish their studies. As a result, if the library can only be free to the public, therefore the impoverished can acquire simple knowledge despite the lack of education at school. They cannot be displaced to other social economic group because they have knowledge that is comparable to educated ones. The information in the public library is vast. It has resources that are being taught at the school. The free entrance of public library is beneficial in displacing people from ignorance.
Overall, in my opinion, libraries should be free for all because it will help the community to become successful if most people are inclined in reading instead of being astray such as drinking or committing crimes. The community will develop if the majority of people are knowledgeable.
Essay 892:
Several sports personalities have brought fame and pride to their country, and some have been successful for considering that as a personal pursuit. Some people are convinced that sports have a significant role and purpose in uplifting the pride of a country. However, others refute that the essence of sports is to make certain people become physically fit.
We must acknowledge the belief of others that sports have important roles in showing the talent of the different individuals. The sports have signified that a country has the ability to display their unique abilities and strengths to other such as boxing, basketball, swimming and other strenuous sports. The sports have seen as an enormous lure which has created impacts and suspense for the sport's proponents. It has made the country’s tension at ease whenever there is an Olympic match or national sports completion. For instance, whenever there is an international boxing competition between the Philippines and other countries, the attention of the supporters are diverted on the fights of their country. The international and national sports events often erase the tension and distance between nations and tribes and offer an excellent opportunity to bring people together. For instance, India and Pakistan have their own political issues but their friendship remains constant in the case of cricket sport.
Not everyone can become professional sports personnel and for them, the sport is a great way of doing the physical exercise and remaining fit. Almost every outdoor sport requires a great deal of physical movement and it can be a great alternative of doing cumbersome exercises. It is proven that people who start doing exercises in a gym often stop doing so because of time constraint or lack of interests. But people who get involved in sports often continue this habit for a long time because of their passion for the game.
In conclusion, people who are good at a sport take it as their career and consider it to be a good role for the others. This is to some extent is a good way of perusing a career and inspiring others. On the contrary, many others take sports activity as part of their daily exercises and do not take it as their career either because they are not optimistic about the future of the sports profession or not good enough to be a renowned sports person. 
Essay 894:
Perhaps no subject in the world causes as much controversy as history does. In recent years, there has been a growing attitude toward understanding history which is to the largest extent beneficial for people of all walks of life. However, there is a view that argues against this and considers no roles for history. In this essay, I will look at both aspects and put forward my observation.
It is obvious that past experience plays a vital role in every facet of human's life. Since our past experience has been tried, we are more likely to be successful in the long run. The better and successful plan is, therefore, offered. From an educational perspective, for example, many people have obtained their qualifications through numerous methods which now they completely obsolete and other innovative means of education have been replaced. In this regard, by looking at previous decades we are more willing to benefit from past experience so as to gain prosperity and make an excellent plan for our future.
On the flip side, despite the fact that looking at history is essential to get inspiration for advancement in life, we should not overlook the sight of the fact that this might be time and money consuming. We are living in a fast-growing world and planning as well as thinking about future is the most beneficial act that we should be able to carry out. As an example, in urban planning, it is totally waste of time if history is taken into account. In addition, many materials which used in past buildings are out of access. Thus, understanding historical building cannot help to make new buildings.
Essay 895:
In recent years, it is undeniable that technology has an integral part to play in our life but besides plenty of benefits that it has brought, there are many drawbacks as well, one of them is about how people have recently treated each other.
In my opinion, the influences of technology on relationships are quite strong and the development of technology has become unfortunately negative. First of all, technology makes people change on only one side, for instance, on the Internet, perhaps he is very sociable and friendly but when it comes to real life, he is not the person whom he is used to be. Besides, one reason that explains this consequence is his shyness, because, on the Internet, he could be anyone whom he wants to be.
Secondly, still a matter of Internet, people might too care about the relationships on their social network accounts forget who they should actually pay attention to, their family, their real friends. For example, a person who has many friends on Facebook is likely to worry about the comments and number of likes that he has.
Last but not least, technology also makes friends’ or family’s relationships less appreciative. Because nowadays, whenever young people, especially teenagers, go out for dinner or just normally hang out, they bring their smartphones which are very convenient and have many interesting apps while they are with their friends or family, they usually focus mainly on their smart devices, so no one speaks to each other.
In conclusion, from my perspective, technology does have a lot of advantages but in recent decades, it has become a quite negative development and had particular bad effects on people’s relationships.
Essay 897:
Smoking and its ample consequences are widely discussed these days all over the world. Research and studies point out that the active and passive smoking are equally threatening to the individual and society. Though there is a small issue regarding the restriction: personal freedom, I hold the view that the ban and restriction on smoking, especially in public places and office settings, are totally acceptable.
One of the obvious reasons, public smoking causes various health hazards. To be more precise, major causes of the lung, oral cancers and heart ailments is none other than tobacco smoking. Prevention is better than cure. Instead of spending a large amount of money to treat these kinds of diseases, government’s decision on banning and controlling on smoking is more economic and effective. Furthermore, passive smoking, which usually happens in public places, claims thousands of innocent people's life across the world. At this juncture, prevention of little freedom like allowing public cigarette flaming is not justifiable. To cite an example, in the USA, the public smoking ban reduces the passive smokers’ cancer rates.
Another reason to support my view is that the public smoking restrictions decline the fire risk rate to a great extent. In other words, in this congested world, allowing of public smoking is like adding fuel to the fire. Careless handling of cigarette fire causes major fire problem. It claims not only thousands of innocent lives but also public possessions. These social problems can be wisely handled by control of public smoking restrictions. In the UK, public smoking ban immensely reduced the building fire incidents in cities is the best epitome. However, an army of people claims that this is the breach of personal freedom. Perhaps it may be true to some degree, but we cannot deny that the public safety is much more important than mild freedom block.
To crown it all, ban and control of public smoking are beneficial, especially for the individual as well as the society. Banning public smoking will enhance the public health and safety in many ways. To consider banning smoking a huge positive impact its ignorable drawbacks are completely negligible.
Essay 898:
Nowadays, the recycling process has turned to the unwarranted activity that is implemented in almost all countries. Governments should indicate an inclination to augment policies in order to cope with waste and related to tremendous issues in advance.
First, the things which are recycled cannot be the same in terms of the quality. During the protracted duration, they are becoming dilapidated and detrimental that can afflict our healthy gradually. Because the recycling process arises under the chemical reactions, as an implication the substances which are utilised for aiding the procedure can mingle with the certain recycling things and generate the harmful goods that we will consume them in the future. Due to it, the governments can impose some stringent rules about the preventing of the waste or such kind of problems via the reducing of the usage of the goods, the increasing of the price of these products and so on.
On the other hand, the recycling method can be very beneficial for our environment. UnfortunateIy, the mankind does not heed to rescue the milieu from the dangerous circumstance painstakingly. Thus, they throw the goods to nature which they have already used without thinking the ramifications of it. Subsequently, it contributes to the big global issue. Albeit this challenge the recycling process can nosedive  the magnifying pollution in the world. At the same time, it is rather pertinent and bargain for some countries. The governments do not spend the supplementary money in order to produce the things again. Instead of it, this money can be invested in the new projects that are more essential.
Taking all thing into account, it seems to me that the recycling operation has a pivotal role in the society and it ameliorates our environment. However, it is a unanimous notion that prevention is better than cure.
Essay 899:
The age standard for children in entering formal school has inevitably been a controversial issue whether it is more effective to send children to school at four years old or seven or even eight years old. I personally agree to say that children need to be sent to school earlier at four years old in terms of several reasons.
The first reason is that children tend to have a golden age period at the age of three or four. This condition is believed as the most effective year for children to start learning as well as understanding their environment. Moreover, this age standard has been successfully implemented by Finland education system which is currently claimed as the best education system in the world.
Another considerable reason is that parents can lessen the time for children to play at home in front of the computers which clearly harm them physically and psychologically as well as create a certain disorder. In addition, sending children to school at an early age will not totally erase the children’s time to play because a school provides them with an effective teaching method which focuses on learning and playing. In the other words, children tend to achieve time to learn and play at the same time proportionally.
On the other hand, people who believe that sending children to formal school at four years old consider several points of views in terms of the maturity of children psychology and brain which claimed inappropriate time to be forced with a certain lesson at school.
Essay 900:
Universities are the best place students always choose after their tertiary schooling. Most of the students prefer to study in a good university. In my point of view, universities take a large amount of money from foreign students because they have to keep their standard and I think it is fair to take more money from the foreign students.
Firstly, universities carry out a particular standard and reputation. When students choose a selected university to study, it increases their productivity as well as overall development. The university charges huge fees for outside students so that they can have qualified and experienced lecturers to teach and mould them. There will be many facilities for the students to access like libraries, laboratories, multi-purpose halls and so on. Universities offer accommodation and food to the students. Students can achieve their dream by studying in a reputed university with an excellent professional background.
Secondly, it is fair to take high fees from the foreign students because if they are getting the quality education and facilities it is worth to get the money from them. They have many options in subjects and it satisfies them by choosing the best university to study. On the other hand, universities do not take much payment from the citizens, they always try to care and protect their citizens by giving good quality education. Moreover, many universities prefer more opportunities for the students to grow as an individual and to get a good job in the future by giving the very good education. Many universities have a different policy for foreign students and they usually take a higher fee from them. The citizens of a country already pay a large amount of tax to the government and thus government ensures the education for their children and grandchildren. So it is totally justified that local students should pay less.  
Essay 901:
It is sometimes argued that increased contact and closer interrelationships between countries bring several benefits to a society and thank goes to air travel and telecommunication for this. Personally, I believe that there are also some negative effects of the above trend, as will now be explained.
There are some downsides to increased commerce and increased relationships between nations in the world. The most significant of these disadvantages is that it can weaken national culture and traditions. The main reason is that people can easily adopt the aspects of strangers and more interesting lifestyles from foreign countries and usually neglect the traditional values. For example, a stand of Vietnamese folk songs might be gradually faded away because young Vietnamese people tend to opt for more attractive Korean music. The second disadvantage is that in the face of imported goods and services, local producers, especially in a less developed country, fail to compete with foreign ones in their own domestic market, which leads to a number of bankruptcies, then holds back society from development.
There are some major points to make in favour of increased business and closer relationships worldwide. Firstly, it can drive the world's economy forward. Granted, big corporations such as Microsoft and Apple can easily expand their branches in any corners of the world, thanks to increased business interaction, which can also create more employment opportunities, especially in a third-world country. Secondly, revenues from tourist activities can contribute to the economic growth. Undoubtedly, tourism jobs such as photographers and tour guides can help increase income for the locals. Finally, the more we share habits, products and services, the better we understand each other, and this reduces prejudice against other nations.
Essay 902:
With the growing population all over the world, many cities are facing too much traffic problems including pollution and congestion. One of the solutions to this problem is the setting of a new tax to car owners. In return, this money could be used to improve public transports and roads. This essay will discuss advantages and disadvantages of this solution.
First of all, the fact to tax private car owners heavily might deter plenty of drivers and car owners using their own vehicles and make them use more public transports in their city. The setting of this new tax could lead to a decrease of congestion and pollution issues.
Furthermore, the harvested money from this new law will be used to remove less efficient and old transports and improve the degree of safety within the city. Indeed, we all know that a lot of people are afraid of public transports at night because of their lack of security. An improvement on this field can encourage other habitats to use public transportation.
However, such a tax also contains disadvantages. Some inhabitants will not agree with this new law because it is another amount to pay at the end of the month. Besides, some people have no choice but to use their own cars to get to their working place which sometimes is located outside the cities where public transports are not available. It will also bring problems for those who live in the countryside and work in cities.
To conclude, taxing private car owners could be a solution to the congestion and pollution problems by encouraging the use of public transports and imposing taxes only to rich populations who live in the city area would be a better solution, in my opinion.
Essay 904:
It is believed that the development of nuclear technology should not be used for any destructive purposes, and it should only be used for some constructive activities. I personally agree with the statement and the following essay will discuss in details about the nuclear technology.
To begin with, it is true that nuclear technology should only be used for some positive activities since it could be a serious threat for human kinds. The technology of nuclear can be utilised as a deadly weapon since it could be used to kill tens of thousands of people in just a few minutes. Besides that, the leakage of the nuclear plants could also give negative effect to human's health, as the radiation could increase the risk of down syndrome and cancer. One of the famous examples is the Chernobyl tragedy which had killed millions of Soviet people. Therefore, the United Nations should strictly monitor and control on countries that used nuclear technology.
In spite of its negative effects, the nuclear technology could be beneficial for mankind. As the world still depending on fossil fuel as the main source of electricity these days, the nuclear technology could be used as a power plant. Many scientists have proven that nuclear electricity plant is more efficient and friendlier to the environment, as it produces less carbon. Besides that, some medical practitioners have used nuclear technology as one of the alternative methods for curing some diseases. Therefore, the technology of nuclear could be useful for the human being as long as it is used safely and proportionately.
In conclusion, it is a fact that nuclear technology could be used for constructive or destructive purposes. I support that the technology should only be used for positive activities such as the power plant or as a medical treatment, and never be used for any negative purpose since it could be a serious threat for human's civilisation.
Essay 906:
It is true that some people believe that Zoos have no beneficial use in our lives. In my opinion, I completely disagree with this view. For a variety of reasons, it would be wrong to think that Zoos are useless. Zoos have environmental, economical, and personal perspectives.
Environmentally, zoos play an important role in wildlife conservation. They allow scientists to study animals and their behaviours. So, they help to protect endangered species like pandas and zebras from predators and humans who hunt animals for commodities such as tusk and fur. By protecting wildlife we maintain the natural balance of all life on the earth.
Secondly, from an economic perspective, zoos employ large numbers of people. As a result, they provide job opportunities and income for the local areas. The money raised can be used for conservation projects and research.
Finally, from a personal perspective, zoos are one of the important educational, interesting, and fun tools. They make a great day out for families to escape the pressure of life. Children, in particular, enjoy learning about animals.  Zoos have an important role in educating the public, helping them to understand the world around them, and enabling them to appreciate wild animals up close. Also, seeing an animal in person is a much more personal and more memorable experience than seeing that animal in a nature documentary. This exposure and education motivate people to protect the animals.
Essay 907:
Children and teenagers are always fond of tales. This is one of the key reasons why many parents tell/read them bedtime stories. Whether the guardian should narrate stories for their kid or they should be left to watch TV/movies, has been one of the most debated topics of the recent times. Some people would argue that storytelling creates a great bonding between the children and their parents. Others claim that by this act children can never become self-dependent. In this essay both the aspects of this statement would be discussed.
Firstly, it is quite evident that parents who narrate tales to their children spend more time with them, as compared to those who don't. This in a way strengthens their relationship. For instance, research around the world has shown that children are more attached to those individuals who spend more time with them. Thus, it is quite apparent that storytelling does play a key role in relationship building between the children and their parents.
Moreover, some argue that telling stories and in turn, spending more time with the kids does make them dependent on their parents. Take for example; the children who can keep themselves busy with books, movies etc. can adjust themselves in isolation from their parents if the situation demands so. Thus, it will help them grow personally and make them self-dependent.
After analysing both the aspects of this argument, it is quite evident that storytelling makes children highly dependent on their parents. But the effects it has on relationship building is something which cannot be neglected. Thus, it can be concluded that storytelling is very rewarding in terms of building relationships and every parent should indulge themselves in it. It is also believed that in the coming future more and more parents will realise the importance of storytelling and will engage themselves with their kids.
Parents obviously play a major role in the way that develops their relationship with their children as they get older. Many people believe that parents should read or tell stories to their kids, while, others encourage that children may read books, watch TV or movies without parents. I strongly believe that parents can significantly impact on a child's development with their tales. These arguments will be analysed prior to coming to a reasoned conclusion.
One of the main benefits of the tales told by the parents is that they talk only good sides of stories. For example, their tales are very interesting for their children. They tell about kings, animals, environments which kids can easily understand and believe. In addition, if the children listen to stories from their parents, they would be obedience to them. In this case, it can give more benefits for parents to control their children.
On the other hand, if children are encouraged for doing these things by themselves, it can lead to some drawbacks. For instance, if the children have access to television or the internet, it may bring bad fluency on their behaviour. On this way, they might develop bad and violent manners and behaviours. Moreover, today's media provide a lot of shows which are about to make a bundle. These kinds of broadcasts impact on a child's mind. So, they start to think about how they can make more money without difficulty. For this reason, they may lose their good study sphere.
In conclusion, after analysing these two points of view, it is believed that parent's tales can provide a supportive, secure, and nurturing environment and interaction with kids, which is crucial for a child to become a good adult.
Essay 909:
Nowadays, it is a ubiquitous notion that the children’s social conduct is changing significantly in some ways as they are becoming adults. There are manifold alterations between the adults and young’s behaviour. In this essay, I will cite some appropriate points about this issue and give my opinion that whether these changes tend to negative or positive direction.
Actually, people's behaviours are contingent upon their ages. The young people are more energetic and of course, it influences to their life perspectives. As bad luck would have it, sometimes the young are being self-righteous despite their wrong manners. Most time their attitudes become obdurate, as a repercussion of it, they squabble with each other over the trivial peccadillos.
On the other hand, the adults' characters differ from the young utterly. They are much more sophisticated in terms of the life experience. That is why they fathom everything thoroughly. It behoves the young to get advice from the adults in order to comprehend the life in depth. At the same time, the grown-up’s behaviour are more tranquil and congenial in the society and it is undoubtfully true that in the essence of each stupendous achievement belonging to any young person stands the old’s aid and advice.
Sometimes as children are getting older, the changes which are encompassed their behaviour tend to the bad way. They feel so that they can do everything and as a result, it contributes to the generating of the feeling of tremendous brash. However, as they become adults, this process inculcates them to garner the new life experiences in the mankind.
Taking all things into account, it seems to me that the changes related  to children’s attitude depend on their trait much more than their age. Because each individual is represented with his character and this personality qualification starts with the time he is born and terminates via the death.
Essay 910:
The earlier we can ban  smoking in public places, the better it would be for the human kind. Having foreseen the same, many offices and governing bodies imposed a strict ban on public smoking. This measure is generally applauded by the majority of mass. However, the opposing minority interrupt this ban as an act of arrest on one's free will. Let us discourse on this moot issue below.
It is generally agreed and even proven with scientific studies, that smoking is injurious to health. Health problems that smoking can induce are numerous. Cancer is among the major detrimental effects of smoking on one’s health.  As it is rightly displayed on the cigar packets , smoking is one of the primary factors leading to cancer. Furthermore, effects of smoking on the systemic and peripheral circulation in the human body are appalling, as put forward by medical experts. The havoc of this insane habit is so horrifying, that research points towards its possible harmful effects on unborn children, even. Smoking is considered as a culprit among the many, behind the congenital birth defects and anomalies.
Another factor significant to this context would be the financial constraints imposed by smoking. In many developing countries, where people work on daily wages, the habit of smoking has an atrocious impact on their quality of life. In the majority of the mediocre families, around the world, smoking drains the significant part of their family budgets. For example, I witnessed many problems with reference to my father being a chronic smoker and the financial crisis it caused.
The amount of carbon and other toxic elements exhaled to the atmosphere by active smokers has reached such dizzy heights that its effect on passive smokers is more or less a reality now. In fact, the effect of first-hand smoke is seen permeable to even the second and third-hand smokers in the spectrum. The significance of the public ban on smoking is not just justifying but a necessity as it calls for. As a result, it is widely banned in some offices and institutions. Awareness programmes are being conducted all around the world against this habit.
Though the public ban on smoking is an individual constraint to one's freedom, considering the passive effects of smoking I would strongly accord win the ban. In my view, this would be a punitive measure to safeguard the health and wealth of the public or the society.
Smoking has inevitably been a concern of governments around the globe considering how to manage and educate smoking people. This is due largely to the danger of the substance contained in the cigarettes, nicotine. As its drawback may also occur for the people near the smokers, policies related to this, particularly in public places, should be taken into account; whether it should be banned or not.
I personally think that forbidding such dangerous activity will be much beneficial that it can prevent others from having a vulnerable respiratory system. Moreover, this can maintain the places so clean that people could always find them fascinating with less air pollution. However, governments should consciously provide some special places which, in this case, can be used for smoking.
On the other hand, people who have currently been addicted to smoke would feel hard to avoid smoking in such places. As a result, they may smoke breaking the rule and not even feeling guilty. For this reason, there are two steps then to encounter this probable emerging problem. First, some strict law and appropriate punishment such as to pay more tax or to give any charity orphans or others needing. Second, education is one of the most prominent and essential ways to change peoples’ belief in terms of having their cigarette burnt.
However, banning such activity in public places is not merely a way to prevent others from the harms of smokes, but it will, to a larger extent, possibly be able to elevate people’s awareness of how dangerous smoking is.
To sum up, despite being a hard thing for smokers to not smoke, the policy which bans smoking in public places should be applied in order to save others. Nonetheless, people’s education in terms of the drawbacks of smoking is a part of this aim.
Essay 911:
It is suggested from a research that the majority of criminals commit crimes when released from jails and this is a very dangerous thing to the society nowadays. I think we should make some regulations and practices to avoid happening this.
The current situation is very worse due to this increasing number of crimes in the world everywhere. Most of the crimes are being done by criminals who were sent to the prison earlier. And this thing gives a feeling to me that if criminals commit crimes, again and again, there is a problem in our punishment system. Therefore government and people should take some actions on this.
As I mentioned above, there might be many reasons for occurring crimes in the society. Firstly, criminals do not have a feeling about the society, culture and religion. Moreover, there is no humanity that can be seen in these criminals. So the Government can put some practices of brainwashing sessions to the prisoners on humanity, culture and other valuable things. Furthermore, it is better if there are some kind of sessions about the art, nature etc. Simply, I would like to highlight that criminals are also human beings and we have to make them think and feel properly before releasing them.
Thirdly, I think it would be great if the jail authority introduces an evaluation process of criminals inside the prison to identify who the better ones before releasing them are. So that we can have a mechanism to keep bad ones inside the prison until they come to a good mindset.
To sum up, I think these crimes are happening due to the bad attitude of criminals. So when we are going to release a criminal, we have to make sure that this person might not commit a crime again when he is set free. To do this, the government has to take some actions inside the prison and then crime level might be controlled.
Nowadays in many countries, the crime rate is at a mammoth rate. Once the criminal is set free from prison, they will do the crime again. There are a number of reasons for this. I will discuss this in the below paragraphs.
Firstly, when the criminals are sent to prison, if they become close to criminals   who committed notorious crimes, they will try to follow them. Also, in some jails, the criminals do some illegal activities by sitting in jail itself. Sometimes, they bring drugs inside the jail premises itself. If the criminals who committed a crime for the first time comes in contact with these criminals, they slowly become drug addicted. This not only disturbs their mind in a negative way as well, but they will not correct themselves once they are released from jail.
Secondly, the society does not accept criminals once they are released. There are cases when even a family will get isolated from criminals.  Also, criminals find it very difficult to get jobs. This makes the criminal's mental upset and for the survival, they repeat the crime again and again.
In order to solve this problem, the government should take some steps. Firstly, in jail, the system should be made in such a way that, the criminals will not indulge themselves in illegal activities. They should be monitored continuously inside the jail. Also, there should be cultural, spiritual programs organised in jail, so that the criminals mind gets prepared when they are released. In addition, criminals who are well talented in some activities like sports, arts, studies etc, should be encouraged. Convicts should be equipped with some useful skills during the detention period, as this will help them for survival after they released. One of the examples would be giving training on technical courses like plumbing or mechanical courses (Automobile repairs) or electronic repair courses etc. Thirdly, awareness should be created in the society so that the criminals are treated as normal human being's once they rejoin the society. There should be job opportunities given to the criminals depends on their talent and behaviour.
To sum up, in my opinion, prevention is always better than cure. Criminals are like us, they are human beings. Some of them might commit crime due to the fact that situation makes them do. The government should create enough employment opportunities so that no one is unemployed. Also, there should be strict rules made about drug mafia so that no one gets into drug addiction. If the government takes these steps very effectively, we can expect crime free society in the near future.
In today’s modern world, the crime rate in everywhere around the globe is increasing at an alarming rate. A recent report research has shown that the continual growth in crime rate is significantly due to a large proportion of criminals will re-offend when they are released from prison. It is, therefore, important for us to establish the practical ways to tackle this problem.
To some extent, I believe that if there is rehabilitation being done in jail, the criminals are unlikely to commit the crime again after they are out of the prison. Rehabilitation is crucial and must be carried out in jail to educate them what are the good values and what are the bad. This action will further encourage them to think about what they have done over the years. Once they realise what they did in the past are wrong, they will regret and may not re-offend whatsoever.
Nevertheless, I have brainstormed and come out with the ideas that could be proved useful in kerbing this problem. To begin, there should be a change in the crime-related legislation. Those who commit serious crimes should be given a lengthy sentence to prison so that they have no opportunity to re-offend. Undoubtedly, it will indirectly become a deterrent to the would-be offender and thus helps to reduce the possibility of commit crimes after they are released from jail. In addition, the government should also arrange paid job to the criminals after they set free from prison, it is owing to the reason that they will not be facing financial hardships. According to a recent study conducted in Malaysia, most of the criminals will re-offend only when they have financial problems.
In conclusion, I believe there are tonnes of ways government can take to cope with this problem and most of the criminals will not commit crimes again if they were given a chance to contribute to society like everyone else do and have a proper job to earn a living.
Essay 913:
Recently, there is an ongoing debate whether it is important to get a good job environment and pleasing job and or to get a job with good wages. I believe the way people’s thinking influences is somehow to consider their decisions for this matter, especially their definitions in happiness and satisfaction in the job. This essay, as my opinion leads to, will try to elaborate both views with some considerations as I agree that enjoyable job is better.
Some of the people have a belief that money can bring anything including happiness. They have dreams to buy luxury goods such as big houses, limited edition cars, updated gadgets or even to collect prestige belongings like rare paintings, sculptures, and something like that, and through that they will feel happy because their stratification in society increasing. These kinds of mindsets can lead to the acknowledgement that bigger payment jobs are better.
However, to think materialism as the goal of life is not relevant in my point of view because enjoyment might not be bought by a piece of papers called dollars. Psychologists explained that if we think money can afford anything, it will be a well-known agreement that the rich are the society class gaining the happiest life, but in the fact, in some ways, tells dissimilar. The rich have more risks to get problems in their families, in educating their children, and other relating impacts which all of them are similarly inevitable. This mindset, the way of thinking that money cannot afford happiness, can be a locomotive for the believers for finding a job which is convenient to avoid the dire effects. They will look for the job with appropriate tasks and deadlines and also consider the environment of business even with a low standard of wages. With happiness, they can get calmness and as a result, they can save money to not to buy for anti-stressed drugs as well as to get into excessive entertainment programs.
In recent days, there is an ongoing debate whether the main factor of working is a salary or an enjoyable environment. Some assert that having high income will help people solving the economic problems, while the others believe that gaining happiness is not only because of having much money but the important one is working in a friendly place. I personally reckon that both views are essential things but I think having enjoyable work is the most important one. Therefore, I will support my view with some considerations.
People obtaining high income will be able to encounter their financial problems because they can fulfil their daily needs. They believe that money can buy happiness because people will be able to buy some luxury things which amuse them. However, it can make them money oriented people. They spend much time only for working consequently they have no time with their family or even their own. Furthermore, they will be full of stress in accomplishing their workload.
On the other hand, people who overly enjoy their time in working field will consider their jobs as something which they love to do so because it is supported by the environment. It can increase their motivation in finishing the workloads. Taken the example, when an employee is encouraged by the others around them, they will try to give their best in their jobs. Moreover, it can increase the sense of belonging towards their works.
Nowadays, most people go to college and university to study a field they might like in order to have a good and enjoyable job. However, money is still an important factor in a job selection, and several people argue that earning money is more important than an enjoyable job.
On the one hand, it is true that in a way, money leads to a better life quality. With more money we can, for instance, consume more, buy good quality products, go on holidays and do numerous activities. All these things contribute to a more enjoyable life. Even though the job we do does not completely satisfy us, all the other moments apart from our job time will be filled with exciting things. The purpose is to reach well-being and to some extent happiness and money is a way to do it.
On the other hand, although money is a way to reach happiness, it may be not enough. It is not by chance that nowadays people are seeking a job that fit their interests. It is a tendency that increases more and more in western countries. For example, universities provide a wider range of topics and programs every year in order to answer the question that every young wonder: "What I want to do of my life?" In some cases, some decide to quit their job, even well paid, because they evolve in an environment they do not like. This is well the proof that money cannot satisfy all our needs.
In conclusion, I personally think that even though money can help to have a better life, it cannot completely lead to happiness. We spend the major part of our life at work and people are more and more aware that this part has to be enjoyable.
Essay 915:
It is certainly true that television has become a basic tool to damage family’s time and communication in society. In addition, while television is extremely useful for leisure time, I do agree with the idea that they already damaged ways of connection between people.
Everything in life has its benefits and its drawbacks, but for television, I think that its drawbacks are away more than its benefits. Nowadays, television’s first and foremost job is separation, all kind of separation. It damages connection between families, for instance, the family now gather for mainly two reasons; first one is for eating while watching television and the second one is to sit down together watching a movie as a family time. Both ways lack any conversation and family speech of any kind.
Whenever, the television is present the talk is absent, friends talking to each other through watching matches instead of meeting at anyone’s house. Physical and sociological health have been affected by television .Television has destroyed the health of kids since they are no longer making any physical activities that help their own health and build up their own mind. Thoughts and ethics are now different than they had before, that’s because children learn everything from their favourite movie or series or both. From this side, television began to replace some of the parent’s work, like teaching their children right concepts, learn how to communicate with people outside and other social skills.    
To conclude, television has been invented so people can find something to do or watch better than sitting alone, alternatively, television just give people distance from their society, friends and relatives. Television now breaks up and separate a part family, however, one of the main goals for television invention is to build up stronger relationships between people not only in one country but also all over the world and to exchange cultures.
Essay 916:
Nowadays, television is undoubtedly one of the most convenient modes of delivering infotainment. It has significantly impacted the lives of people by taking their chunks of time from their daily routine life. It has been argued that television has started threatening the future of the family and social life as well as minimising the instinct of community. This would be proven by analysing the consequences of unrealistic life being telecasted on TV channels as well wastage of precious time while watching the TV programs.
Firstly, the programs aired on TV channels are usually far away from the reality. Especially, when we take an example of entertainment programs in which the programs are far from the reality not representing the actual culture and society problems. Further, these sought of programs tend to change the perception of people and tend to influence their lives in a negative way making them think in the opposite direction. It is obvious by looking at the example that these impractical programs are pushing people away from the real world. Thus, it can be concluded that unrealistic programs are seriously creating a dent in the family and social life.
Secondly, the telecasted programs are draining people precious time. The golden time they can utilise with their families to discuss issues like children education, financial matters, future plans etc. For instance, it has been proven that the families which don’t spend time with each other can be a source of rising tensions and distances consequently, the family life will get affected. This example shows that loss of time can be a major problem for people and it is depriving them with the essence of a single community.
To conclude, the gloomy picture of life being shown on TV and valuable time being wasted by watching TV has proven to be a major hit on family and social life. I strongly believe, the excessive use of TV by the general public has compromised the lives of people by making them not only isolated from the society but also from their immediate family. In near future also, it is highly unlikely that viewership of television will decrease due to an ever growing interest of people in it.
Essay 918:
Normally, museums are considered to have a vital function in serving their public for educational purpose, yet many museum goers also aim to seek an entertainment experience, which, I believe, is nearly impossible to end up with a 'purely entertaining' experience.  
There is no doubt that a primary role of museums is to educate the public. They provide tangible objects and collections that can be genuinely seen and touched by students. This provides excellent field trips for extensions of a classroom as well as enhancing their curriculum. If they were changed to be entertaining-oriented to attract more visitors, then the quality of art or a history would probably be degraded or distorted, hence weakening the function of educating. Eventually, museums would be nothing less like theme parks, aiming to profits generating rather than benefiting the public.  
However, there is also another voice claiming that museums should be interesting and playful, providing a relaxing place for people to have fun in their leisure time. Once they are solely built for learning without even a little of enjoyment, they would lose popularity and even financial support due to failing to attract enough visitors.
My view is that education and entertainment don't necessarily have to be mutually exclusive motivations for coming to the museum, but they can be integrated to achieve both aims. In fact, from our own school experience, we are more likely to be motivated to explore if content is truly entertaining, and meanwhile, if we can gain something meaningful through recreation, then it's a win-win situation.
Essay 919:
Irrespective of nationality, location or religion, back in time, the old ones were considered the base of the society. No doubt, nowadays, the roles have exchanged, with the young people becoming more and more powerful and influential.
To begin with, one of the reasons this phenomenon took place is the increasing competitiveness of the modern world. The recent criteria are tougher and tougher, which means that more allotted time by humans is required. While young people tend to invest a lot of their time in things such as academics or work, older people have usually a family and more affairs to deal with. Thus the productivity of young people is higher, resulting in a more implicated and influent generation.
Secondly, the modern environment is in continuous change, which means that people nowadays must adapt quicker and better. As an example, take the accent which is put on multi-disciplinary, lifelong training, or the fact that students are prepared for jobs that do not merely exist yet. All these are supported better by younger people, and the invaluable proof is, for example, the shrewdness with which a child learns how to work on a computer, an action almost impossible for some adults. Considering these abilities of adoption, it becomes obvious why young people tend to occupy more and more important places in society.
Conversely, the young generation may become disrespectful to adults, on the basis of their achievements. The youngster especially may consider that they do not have anything to learn from older people, resulting in a continuous intellectual falling.
owadays, modernisation defines how technology can be a powerful tool and this has changed the way young people used to perceive their position in a society. The young group are far more motivated by the technological transformation, thus giving them the power over the past young generations. This essay will discuss some reasons why this is happening in today's world and how this development impacts their relationship with the elder people.
To begin with, youngsters are fit for the jobs that require technological soundness. They tend to be curious about the modern changes, therefore they are more likely to adapt to it. Due to this adjustment process, they invest their time learning and applying to institutions that can provide opportunities for them. Furthermore, present young generations are enthusiastic, thus they are more observant with the changes on how this transformation help the society.
Second, they are physically fit for the job, since this change results in tons of stressors. Numerous studies show that today's individuals can still be productive with only four to six hours of sleep. Since they invest more of their time with research and discovering new ideas, then they are more capable of handling bigger responsibilities compared to the previous young generations and present older generation. Moreover, past youngsters were more focus on their families and the commitment but this is not the case today. Youngsters are becoming entrepreneurs and using their knowledge to become successful.
On the contrary, this transformation may create a negative impact on the relationship between the old and young group. For example, young people may create distant relationships with the old generation, since they know that they are ahead in terms of learning and adapting to change.
To conclude, young people are now dominating the technological world and as a result, the old generation is now experiencing less importance. However, youngsters should always respect the elder people and maintain a steady relationship with them for a better society.
Essay 921:
With the advent of the 21st century, technology has leapt to a level that was unimaginable only even 50 years ago. The question is whether latest technology has provided us more free time than previous generations or not. In my view, people's leisure time has been narrowing as a result of the tremendous advance in modern technology.
In today's modernised era, technological gadgets make our lives faster, easier and more convenient. For example, dishwasher, a labour-saving device in the home fetches people more recreational time. In addition, almost all modern kitchens have several electrical appliances that save our time.
However, people's leisure lives are continuously eroded because of the ubiquity of modern technological tools, such as computers with internet access and telecommunications equipment. These inventions expose the minds to spend more of their daily time. It is noteworthy that people now take fewer and shorter vacations following the increase in the number of technology-based activities. For instance, cell phones and laptops make people accessible to their superiors wherever they go. What is more, people seem to be more ambitious these days, and they want a better quality of life for their families. This means that both parents usually need to work full-time. So, it can be said that the time budget is burdened because more time should be invested in activities that previously ignored.
In conclusion, while there are some reasons to believe that people now get more free time in the development of technology, my own view is that the amount of leisure time has decreased to a great extent over the last decade.
Essay 923:
It is true that the principle idea of occupation is to get the salary. People usually prefer those jobs that offer high wages and facilities. However, I agree with the statement to some extent. I reckon that, money would be the prime concern of work, nevertheless, it also provides the meaning of our existence.
Firstly, the value of money is almost vivid to all. For example, since ancient time, coins were used as salary in turn to buy food and clothes. The same trend we can see in our present world, hence money is a crucial factor to survive. People also work to support their family, so that they could pay for their basic necessities, such as accommodation, education costs, food, tax, bills etc. Additionally, many people work to secure their future prospect. If we no longer needed money, I doubt people will choose to continue their jobs.
On the other hand, work plays a vital role to embark upon a ship which has a definite meaning of its excursion. Moreover, we can assume the actual value of life. For instance, an inactive life leads to boredom, followed by loneliness and depression. The activity provides actual direction and motivation in order to pursue exact goals of our life. To add with, workless life may distract the person towards explicable acts, hence in some cases, people may find themselves in traps of addiction that may draw numerous hassles for both individual and society.
Essay 924:
The life of humans in today's society is becoming more and more stressful. People have to face many problems and overcome a lot of hurdles to live in the current society. There are a couple of reasons for this miserable life, some have family issues and some have office disturbance and while others have business disputes. In this essay, I will discuss some key reasons for stressful life and in the end, I will give solutions to the situation.
Firstly, the main problem which is causing our lives more problematic is the traffic problem, whether you have to go to college, school or office, have to overcome the traffic congestion, blockage or line-in in at the traffic signals. Heavy rush at roads causes the stress and when they reach their destination still they are feeling the miseries of the route, and at the end, they are not so fresh to start their day. The same situation while going back home adding up to the office tension and resulting in home fights.
Secondly, the household problems are adding a huge part in stressful life. When you have less income than your expenditure than problems start in your married life and having one kid adds up the tension. You always worry about grocery, garments, rents and bills; these all necessities dominate your income and leave you with only tensions.
These problems could be eradicated wisely by taking decisions. You can overcome traffic problems by shifting nearer to your office or business. The government can balance this issue by building multi-tier flats in nearby commercial areas or commuting transports or trams to office thus reducing the travel time and miseries. Another step Government should be taking is by lowering the bills and grocery items and setting the minimum wages for the general public. But eventually, every person should have to take steps to remove the stress by own efforts or helping each other to live a happy life.
The modern world struggles for existence is the key to one's success. Apparently, this has made the life of every individual a highly stressful one. There are many aspects attributing to this struggle like health reasons, financial insecurity, work pressure etc. Serious measures need to be taken to overcome this stress. Today those areas will be discussed in details.
Firstly, a healthy life is the precursor to happiness. So, the major contributor towards the stress in a normal person's life is their unhealthy condition. For instance, an employee who due to health reasons takes a week off from work, get a lot of work pressure when rejoins the organisation, hence, leading toward an enormous stress. Moreover, studies all around the world have proved that individuals in poor financial condition lead a more stressful life when compared to the wealthy one. For example, a daily worker who just manages to earn enough for his/her daily meals always has a tension of missing one day's wage. Thus, after analysing the above points we are in a position to state that poor health and wealth condition catalyses to the stress of a person.
Now once we have discovered the reasons leading to stress, it's time to discuss the preventive majors for it. The entity playing the key role in stress control is the government. If the government is well managed and they have proper plans in place to overcome the health and wealth uncertainty of every individual, then the stress does automatically reduce. For example, if a poor worker doesn't have to worry about his one day's wage loss then they can lead their life more peacefully. Hence, we can say that primarily the government needs to implement policies which will be attributing towards stress prevention.
After analysing the reasons for the stress and ways to overcome it, we can safely conclude that the health and wealth are the most important reasons attributing towards stress and the same can be solved by the few changes in the government policies. It is also believed that in future government will make a note and work towards this very critical issue.
Essay 925:
It is true that animals are used for research in a variety of sitting, including tests to determine the safety of drugs, cosmetics and other substances. Although reasons can be given to justify this view, I personally believe that these experiments should be banned because it is ethically unacceptable.
There are several reasons why some people support using the animal in the medical research and other products testing. Firstly, the human is the important being on the planet so everything should be done to ensure human safety and survival. Animal testing enables scientific and researchers to test the safety of medication and other substance with which humans have regular contacts. Drugs, for instance, may pose significant harm to humans, so testing them on animals first give researchers good chance to determine drug safety before human trials are performed.
Secondly, researchers aim to minimise the suffering that animals experience in experiments by giving painkiller and anesthetic drugs. However, I would strongly agree with those who believe that animal experiments should be banned. Animal right activists (who defend animal right) argue that the lives of animals should be respected. The benefits of research using animals do not justify the suffering caused and the ethical debate against animals testing. Also, there are alternative non-animals methods of testing. For instance, computerised human - patient simulators and In vitro testing which is defined as a research using human cells and tissue can be used instead of using animals.
In conclusion, there are some convincing arguments for and against animal testing, but I strongly believe that we as humans have no moral right to do experiments on animals and we should do everything we can to protect them.
Essay 927:
The world today is inevitably becoming more and more competitive. To cope with this competitive world, people have to keep pace with it. Therefore, some people think that lives have become more stressful than before. In this essay, the causes behind this and the possible ways to tackle the problem will be discussed in detail.
In today's high-tech world, there is so much to do for people. People are busy and have no time for anything else. This has, however, impacted the lives of many individuals from children to adults, rich to poor. Firstly, children are anxious about facing the world in future. Therefore, to do this effectively they are fighting for the top position in universities and colleges with their counterparts. This, in turn, leads to the stress of achieving the goal in life. Lack of respect and light bonding in the family often contribute to a stressful life for adolescence. Sometimes the drug abuse issue by a family member ruins the peacefulness of the whole family.  
On the other hand, adults, who have already acquired knowledge and currently in a job, face the tension of salary to satisfy their needs and fulfil their desires. Job satisfaction and the low income they earn is another factor causing stress. Furthermore, life also becomes stressful for those who are unemployed. Interestingly, people who are rich, well to do and have everything in life, also face problems likely insecurity. This is due to the fact that the crime rate is increasing day by day.
Hence, there can be an endless number of reasons behind this. Nevertheless, these problems could be tackled to some extent by enforcing a few laws and regulations. For example, the government should take strict action against theft and criminals. They should be given acceptable punishment for the crime they commit. Secondly, patrolling should be increased in the areas where the crime rate is high. Moving onto the problems of competition and salaries, jobs should not be provided only on the basis of marks and salaries should be increased to some extent with the extra provision of rewards and incentives. Lastly, the unemployment problem should be dealt with and new job opportunities should be opened up for those unemployed.
To sum up, challenges and problems are part of life. Everyone has to face it someday. According to my opinion, it should be handled bravely and by making a few practical changes so as to overcome the stress caused by it.
It is believed that the daily lives of mankind have become more stressful these days. There are various reasons that have caused the situation, and the following essay will discuss in details the causes and some of the ways to address the issue.
It is true that the daily routines of people's lives are becoming more stressful nowadays, especially for those who live in big cities, such as in New York, Singapore or Jakarta. One of the factors that have caused the stress is work pressure. Due to globalisation and the free trade zone, business competition is getting tougher these days and it has increased the workload of many employees. Besides that, density and traffic have also contributed to the problem as well. Many people have to commute to work at the earliest time of the day and come home late at night to avoid traffic. As a consequence, many of these people are exhausted, frustrated and burn out with their daily lives.
There are several things that governments could do to solve the issue. Firstly, as the world economy develops, governments should strictly monitor and review employers' treatment of their labours. Governments must ensure that companies have been employing their labours at proportionate working hours to reduce the stress level and to avoid any fatal work accidents. Secondly, governments should also expand their long-term development plan, by developing new areas. By expanding new areas, it is hoped that some of the city people will move to new areas, and it will reduce the density and traffic issues which have caused stress. Thirdly, governments should also add more public facilities, such as playgrounds, parks and sports fields for their residents. It is a fact that doing some recreational and sports activities could reduce the stress level.
In conclusion, many experts believe that the day to day lives of people have become more stressful. There are some factors that have caused problems such as tight business competition, density and traffic problems. However, there are some steps that governments could do to reduce the stress level, and some of them would be by monitoring the companies, expanding new areas and provide more recreational facilities for the public.      
Essay 928:
These days, stress is getting the more serious problem that people face and the temp of the enormous rise of this issue is turning into a tremendous challenge. This essay will discuss the causes as well as examine the solutions for dealing with this issue.
It is obvious that today’s modern and complicated world brings an immense amount of stressful pressure on individuals than it was in the past. Firstly, a highly competitive work environment stresses people in a greater way, while previously seeking a job and survival mechanism in the workplace was not too hard.   Additionally, because the current necessity for women to go to work and, at the same time, to be a good wife as well as successfully raise children makes their lives more stressful. Moreover, increasing the level of women’s responsibilities puts enormous pressure on men who still need to earn and share the responsibilities with women.
However, there are ways to tackle such problems. The main solution could be introduced by the government. For example, it can make the problem of seeking a job less stressful by creating more workplaces and organising agencies to help potential employees meet their future job. Also, the government can create more social organisations that help families share the responsibilities of raising children.
To sum up, it is evident that the level of pressure that makes persons feel more stressed is gaining momentum. There are several causes leading to it such as hard to find a job and the fear of losing it as well as growing responsibilities on families. In spite of that, various solutions exist to mitigate these issues.
In the twenty-first century, it is admittedly, apparent that the lives of people around the globe are becoming harsher which eventually cause the citizens to become more stressed. It is important to establish the causes and effective ways of solving the problem.
Undoubtedly, following the development of nations, the world has become more competitive in terms of career for adults and study for youngsters. Nowadays, employees are expected to do more work as compared to previous days in order to secure a decent job. They may work overtime most of the working days without being paid extra by the company just to finish off loads of work. In addition, students are also becoming more stressed as they are sent by their parents to attend extra tuition classes so that there are improvements in their academic performance.
Furthermore, people, these days are more status-conscious and materialistic. Every minute they are thinking of ways to earn more money so that they may become affluent one day which allows them to fulfil their own demand. They believe money is the best tool to gain happiness but in fact, they are wrong. These are the reasons why citizens are more stressed than previously.
However, there are tonnes of ways which could prove useful in kerbing this problem. Wise time management is crucial for everyone to have an organised and well-planned timetable. By doing so, people have a specific time of relaxing like spending time with family or friends rather than bury their heads into their works. It is significant to socialise with others or sometimes sharing your problems with family can help people to unwind. Furthermore, exercise plays an indispensable role in mitigating the negative impacts of this problem. During exercise, a chemical is known as endorphin will be released which keep our mind off from stress for a certain period of time.
In conclusion, there are several causes which lead to a hectic life. Nevertheless, there are a handful of ways to cope with this problem. I believe we can live in a harmonious and yet relaxing environment provided that we follow the stated practical ways of de-stress.
Essay 930:
It is a frequently debated fact that some people are gifted with some abilities in their genetic, but the others do not have this kind of prodigiousness. By contrast, some people think that any person could be a successful musician or sportsman by education, practice and proper guideline.
On the one hand, each individual has a tendency on a specific field of art or a science. However, a minority of them are geniuses who show off a splendid success on their jobs. For instance, most of the investors, such as Einstein, Newton, Edison and Graham bell. They were geniuses and had genetically intellectual capacity much more than the other people. Furthermore, this kind of successful people could be seen in sports and music also. Messi and Mozart are the good examples for achieved sportsman and musician. Thus, some people could be more capable than the others in certain areas.
On the other hand, some people think that every child could be a successful person through education. In other words, success is behind the education, continuous practices and working hard. The abilities that people have do not provide a differentiation on the achievements of them. The difference among the people’s success is derived from the quality of education that they got. Thus, any person who were the same position and had a similar education would be able to indicate awesome performance.
Finally, each person has different kinds of abilities, skills, talents in different areas. The abilities, skills and tendencies of children detected in early ages and children should get an education in the fields that they have the tendency. Thus, both nurture and nature are effective on the success of people.
Throughout the enormous capacity of human history, we came across countless people with extraordinary talents in art, music, sport, science and so on. However, of all these experts, some are innate with a precious gift while others were acquired, trained when they were children. Nevertheless, success is often combined with many factors including environments, the extent of practice, training methods, and indubitably, a certain level of talents. Therefore, I believe in congenital talents, which, to say the least, are the essential element to success.
Susan Boyle, an ordinary middle-aged woman who never received any professional training as an opera singer, was able to earn a deafening standing ovation from the whole podium by singing "I had a dream", a song which would require a professional singer to pour their genuine devotion in order to reach perfection. A genetic research indicated that up to 50% of the great artists we came to recognise were born with supreme talents. These prodigies are sometimes so unfairly gifted that they will leave a ghastly gap between those who were trained to be professional and were not supposed to be outrun single-handedly.
Nevertheless, people still claimed that anyone can be trained to become a professional. Jeremy Lin, a rising NBA basketball player who created "Linsanity", had grabbed the sheer opportunity to success by polishing his skills and training ever since he was a child and committed his dedication in basketball no matter what difficulty that lied ahead. Yo Yo Ma, a phenomenal musician, started his cellist training when he was only four and immersed his whole dedication into it throughout his life. These people's success is not instantaneous. Their paths to glory were established through hard work, accompanied by consistent training and still, a certain degree of innate talents.
In today's modern world, we are constantly bombarded with the idea that those who achieve success in their careers or studies are born with certain talents. Some people, however, are of the opinion that every child can be as talented as them as they assert that children nowadays can be sent to classes to learn the required technique. Thus, we will examine both sides of the arguments before reaching a reasonable conclusion.
Admittedly, some people seem to be more talented than others due to the extraordinary achievements they have ever had which then leads to the belief that they are born with a specific talent. They can pick up or learn new things that they have not been exposed to in the certain field, for example, sports or music, much faster than others. It is also believed that parents who have mastered the skills in sports, then their children are more likely to be born with such skills as well. Hence, the children are, normally, able to achieve their aspirations easier than others, in other words, they do not need to work so hard like other people do in order to succeed in their careers or studies.
Nevertheless, it does not mean that other people who do not bear with such talents will certainly fail to reach their targets. I believe everyone can be as successful as those who are skilled and talented provided that they are willing to be more dedicated in making attempts to strike their goals. According to the statistic of a recent research conducted in Malaysia, it has shown that about 75% of the people are not born with specific talents but they are still managed to pay extra attentions to their weaknesses and made a change in order to become successful in a certain career. Therefore, it is apparent that although the majority of people worldwide are not born with talents, due to their patience and endurance, they have stricken their targeted goal.
In conclusion, I believe that every individual around the globe can still achieve their aspirations regardless of their talents as long as they are willing to pay more hard works than others. Our nation will surely to continue to prosper and flourish in the decades to come if there are more citizens who become successful in their careers.
Essay 932:
From centuries music is indeed a need for all humans, and music transforms the life of a big majority of people whether it is in the form of fame or in the money. All humans admire music, as it provides relaxing feeling and a way to run off from the tensions of life. Some people have God gifted ability to sing while others have to take lessons either from schools/colleges or from instructors. A great number of people's opinion is that time and money spent on music is not necessary, they believe that all resources are to be used in learning useful subjects. I am not totally in agreement with the statement and in this essay I will discuss both views with the conclusion.
First of all music is a way of earning for a majority of peoples. Nowadays it has become a career path for people loving to be a singer. There are many forms of music like guitar artist, drummer or vocalist, these all have a significant place in the society as in every restaurant or casino there is a need of music, actually the live music, which ultimately attracts a vast majority of public and ultimately increase revenue. So more and more people need to learn the music it seems to them that they have brighter future in the field. And the time, money or other resources they spent on music classes expel rebate to them in near future.
On the other hand, resources spent on learning useful subjects have their own worth. Peoples investing in these fields also have a good outcome of their efforts and in the end when they became a top engineer or Doctor and having a name in the society also admire the music of their inmates currently in the field of music.
In the end, I would say that you have to work hard either you are choosing music or some other field to become prominent in the society. Peoples always admire your work whether you are famous Doctor, a talented engineer or fascinating singer. Peoples have to decide are they investing their resource in the right direction or not.
It has been a debatable issue whether to spend time and money on music classes or not at the school level. Some sect of people argues that music tutorials are simply a waste of time and money instead they suggest to use that time in improving academic performance. However, I believe that school should be encouraged to attend music classes.
There are myriad reasons why a child must be sent to music classes. Firstly, music has the power to generate life in inanimate things. Music represents the art of living. A student with knowledge of music will definitely become soft-hearted, kind and mainly pleasant minded. Music improves mental ability which in turn increases concentration power. Thus a child can utilise this power in studies to attain good results.
In today’s world, there is a bright career in music. Moreover, pop musicians, singers, music directors, etc get high endorsements. For instance, the legend of the music industry, Oscar award winner A. R. Rahman is a well-known live example who shows the importance of music in life. However, to an extent, music is an innate talent and all the children do not same interest in it. So, in such cases, it may be a waste of time as well as an extra burden on a school student to handle both music classes and also academic syllabus.
On the other hand, some people assert that children should make use of money and time in learning useful subjects like science and computers rather than on music classes. Subject related classes enhance their in-depth knowledge of academic concepts. To add more, it will be a kind of revision that increases grip on the school subjects. Ultimately this yields good results. And as we know good results ensures their bright future with a better job. Therefore, it seems wise to spend time and money on useful subjects instead of music classes.
Music makes mind pleasant, music makes a person’s mind rejuvenated relieved and de-stressed. Inculcating music from childhood days develops a good impact on one's mindset as the child grows, so it is good that music is made a part of schooling subject in school.
If we consider the benefits of listening and practising music, it is surprising to note that music rejuvenates and refreshes minds of people. Music soothes a soul which in want for some peace, it is also said that music heals and changes attitudes of a person.
Apart from the personal benefits, the music changed people’s lives. Many contemporary musicians developed their native music in such a way that we sing and hum to their tunes though it might not be understandable by us. For example, the music series by “The Corrs” especially the feathers made us feel the essence of music.
Musicians who opted music as their career developed themselves as Icons and for them the sky is the no limit for their achievements. If music is nurtured from childhood days, their attitudes develop and even their gentleness develops making them as gentlemen and women. Apart from the personal benefits, if the music is learned from the beginning we could see in future many musicians who could do wonders with music.
As far as my opinion is concerned music should be a part of subjects and should be taught and practised right from the childhood days, further I completely disagree that money and time spent on music is a waste. Though importance has to be given to the science and computers, a music class does not steal the scientific and computing knowledge out of child’s curriculum and mind
Since the dawn of time, subjects such as science, computer and music have been included in every school's curriculum. However, throughout history, music has been seen by many that studying music is not that really important compared to those two subjects. It is agreed that children must learn vital subjects like science and computer while music should just be optional. This argument will be proven by looking at how the two subjects are important in life and music is only for recreation.
For one, science and computer are important for our daily lives. For example, when I was studying, science class allowed me to learn the process of the scientific method, problem-solving and critical thinking. These are essential in life and I am using these in every decision I make. Also, in my computer class, I learned how to use the internet that is really a vital tool in doing my research in things I need to know. These make it clear that children should learn science and computer.
In addition to this, music is just a hobby and it should be optional for children to study. An instance illustrating this action is I. I am not really into music actually, and if I want to learn some sort of this subject, I can just go to the Internet, go to YouTube website where I can watch and study anything. Thus, it is important that the young ones should study computer and the Internet. It is obvious from this that music is not as essential as those of the two mentioned subjects.
In conclusion, learning science and computer technology are really useful in our day to day life and music is only for recreation and should just be an option in school. It has been proven that children should learn these essential subjects and music should be optional. Thus, it is recommended for the parents to encourage their children to study hard the science and computer subjects.
Essay 934:
One of the most controversial issues today relates to whether the parents or teachers in the school have the responsibility to teach children to be good citizens. Therefore, we will examine both sides of the issues in this essay.
Undoubtedly, parents have an indispensable role in guiding their children when they are small to the right path towards their future lives. It is proven that children are more influenced by their parents than anyone else. They will think that what their parents do is always right, thus parents are advisable to be an excellent role model for their children. Parents, for example, could teach them the good moral values through storytelling. It is not only will benefit the individuals themselves but a society as well.
Nevertheless, teachers should do their part well in school by teaching the children what are the good values. Children nowadays spend most of their daytime in school, so teachers have the most important obligation to make sure the children turn out to be a well-behaved member of society. It is encouraged that teachers should punish the students whenever they make mistakes such as fighting in school. By doing this, the students will know that fighting is a bad behaviour and they may change their way of behavioural and it can also act as a deterrent to other students. Besides, teachers can also emphasise the importance of being a good individual in terms of behaviour while teaching.
Essay 935:
From the dawn of the time, most people allotted greatly of their time working. Throughout the history, a lot of researchers tried to come up with a definition and ways to achieve job satisfaction. Being satisfied with one's job is an integral part for you to have a happy life and great physical and emotional well-being. This will be proven on how job satisfaction differs from one individual and another. It is greatly affected by one's definition of satisfaction and their expectation on the job.
To begin with, nowadays people's lives greatly depend on their income and benefits from their job. Salary seems to be an essential element in considering their happiness and contentment to one's job. Another contributing element is the working environment. A healthy working environment consists of a good relationship between the employee and the employer, as well as their colleague, this has been an important role in attaining job satisfaction. In addition, without any doubt having a good time at work is one to take into consideration. To be more specific no one can be satisfied with their job if they are having an unhealthy relationship with their colleagues, this will definitely give them a lot of stress and will soon affect the person's job performance. Last but not the least, career growth opportunity is also one of the elements to be considered to attain a great job satisfaction that triggers the employee's happiness and making them realise their potentials.
Apparently, there are so many contributing elements to attain job satisfaction. But it is really possible for one to be satisfied with their job? In my own point of view, I would definitely agree that one can be satisfied on their job depending on their definition of satisfaction and depending on their reasonable and attainable expectation on their work. In my case, if I have to dependent on my salary and benefits for my job satisfaction it will be certain that I'm unsatisfied with my current job. As no one will be satisfied with their job if that will be their basis, because a good financial compensation and an excellent benefit is just a prize for all your hard work. Furthermore, working long hours and having a low salary will be out of the picture if you will just learn how to love your work and enjoy what you are doing.
To sum it up, although it is hard to be fully satisfied on one's job, it would be great if you will focus on the positive aspect of your work ad ignore the negative side of it, in order for you to achieve job satisfaction and happiness in life.
Job satisfaction is apparently a very essential part for people. Many people try their hard to meet the job satisfaction. Thus, they may spend most of their time working. Although work satisfaction can be extremely subjective and can differ among people, yet there will be some factors leading to work satisfaction, for instances achievement, reward, better working environment, nice co-workers, career prospect and suitable job responsibilities.
To begin with, achievement is one of the important elements contributing to job satisfaction. Achievement can be addressed as fulfilled goals of an organization or job. When someone has successfully obtained the purpose of his job, emotionally he will get such satisfaction. For example, in arranging a social event, the organizer may feel satisfied and respectful when the event runs smoothly and successfully reaches the peak of the event.
In addition, reward also may contribute to job satisfaction. Reward is considered as something or gift given to someone as an award for his or her achievement on working. It may trigger happiness on workers and give them satisfaction as they perceive being appreciated by other people. Giving a holiday, for example, to a worker who completely finished her work will lead her to a job satisfaction as emotionally she feels what she did already met the requirement and objective.
Salary, increment, compensation and rewards for extra works often motivate people and make them happy in their jobs. Apart from personal benefits, well-behaved boss, nice co-workers, suitable job responsibilities and nice and fair working environment are other important aspects for job satisfactions.  
Meanwhile, expectation of job satisfaction for employees may be realistic when the can directly benefit from their employers. For example is receiving reward and self-pride. They may contribute to self-value and prestige of someone that may lead her to job satisfaction and promotion for a better position in her working place. However, people have different expectations from their jobs and that’s why satisfying all employees is impossible.
All in all, job satisfaction can be determined by some factors and individuals may perceive different satisfaction. It can be personally dependent. However, the expectation of job satisfaction can be realistically assessed through reward and job promotion, though that will not fulfill every one’s expectation.
Essay 936:
Nowadays, the destruction of animals is increasing at very fast pace. This has sparked a heated debate. Some people contend to use animals and consider their rights but others had a notion of utilising them for their personal benefits. This essay would discuss the both the sides of the issue.
On one side, individuals should consider the rights of animals. Animals are also one of the living creatures on this planet and have right to live freely. They do have the feelings and understanding of the relationships. For example, dogs are considered to be loyal towards his owners and even sometimes sacrifices their life for the sake of protecting their owners’ life. Thus hurting them means creating curse for ourselves.
On contrary part, animals can provide the regardless benefits to economy and society of a country. Many people  do a business in the field of dairy farming, poultry farming, making the shoes, bags from the skin of animals ,meat industry and make good profits. Furthermore, animals are also involved in the sports these days. For instance horse riding and bull fighting are very common at present. As a consequence, all these contributing to the growth of the economy and satisfying the needs of human race.
To put it in a nutshell, although human cannot think about their progress without animals but the distortion of living creatures seems inhuman. In my opinion, animals provide us unlimited resources without any cost. So we should utilise them in control way and restrict the killing. Ultimately, for the sake of humanity and get the valuable products for a longer time we must provide them healthy and secure life.
One of the most controversial issues, these days is related to, how animals should be treated by individuals. Although, some people declare that we need only to stop hitting and killing the various animals around us, but I believe that a strict law by governments should be applied to save these creatures. An analysed debate will be provided before a reasonable conclusion will be found in the next paragraphs.
Some People claims, that dealing with animals for a long time, help a sheer change in personalities and adopt inhuman attitudes. Also, some expert state that the only place where animals fit is research and experiment facilities. They also clearly say that farms are the perfect way to contain farming animals, so humanity can use them meat, milk and even leather. They also argued that majority of fatal sickness generated by farming animals. For instance, take SARS as an obvious example of that and how farming birds help to spread it.
On the other hand, the advocate of animal rights state, that we are dealing with poor creatures, which do not have the ability to identify the differences between good actions and a bad one. In addition, childhood consultant trust that, the majority of child violence actions children do against the younger children is related to copying parents actions towards farming animals. For example, a 7-years-old child killed his younger sister with axe copying what his father doing to them farming cheeps.
Essay 937:
In this digital age, we are barraged with an endless amount of advertisements on a daily basis, ranging from adverts on our cell phones to personal soliciting. Nonetheless, many of the methods used to advertise can be considered unacceptable and immoral.
To begin, a common agenda of many advertisers is to first make their audience feel deprived and then to instil a belief in their viewers that only through buying the advertised product or service, they can attain satisfaction. Most people would agree that this strategy is at the very least unacceptable and at worst sinister. Another unacceptable tactic used by advertisers is the deliberate misrepresentation of their products as being scarce and only available for a limited amount of time, by doing this they exploit the human psychology, which places a higher value on things that are apparently not abundant.
In addition, the fact that we can’t escape from advertising is in my opinion, an invasion of personal privacy. In this era of democracy, human beings should have the free will to decide what information they wish to receive but through internet and telemarketing, advertisers have the choice to shove their products down our throats. To illustrate, when browsing the internet, ads can pop up anytime, one after another and after a certain number of times, these intrusive ads can become excruciatingly frustrating.
Today's significant development of information technology facilitates industries to advertise their products and services widely and in a more variety of platforms which leads advertising activity to be uncontrollable. Furthermore, this brings the companies to make advertisements intensively by eliminating code of conduct causing the existence of unethical and unacceptable advertisements in today's society.
A large number of uneducated commercials nowadays force parents to be more aware of their children because it can affect their children's development. For instance, cigarette ads in TV channels purposed for over-17-year-old citizens can be consumed by underage people (children and teenagers). We do not realise that this circumstance can stimulate children's curiosity to smoke, consequently, we often find underage smokers.  Apart from targeting teenagers, advertisers often give fabricated information and mislead adults. This has a huge negative impact on our society- while the product manufacturers amass a large fortune, which costs huge hard-earned money of public.  
On the other hand, it has been common in today's advertising when enterprises advertise their product, they make an advert containing pornographic content. For example, the “Segar dingin susu soda” advertisement, a drinking advertisement gives an unethical impression by showing a sensual style of the artist played by Julia Perez wearing super-sexy clothes. This condition is not acceptable and unreasonable because it can trigger the watcher’s desire and is not in line with the product advertised.
Advertisements are meant to describe the advantages and outstanding features of a product or service while most of the advertisements shown on TV and the internet are highly deceptive and contain sexually explicit materials. These should be controlled by any means or the society would get affected the slow poisoning of negative and unsuitable advertisement virus.
To sum up, it is obvious that most of today's advertisements are not acceptable for the society referring to a large number of unethical adverts which are often found these days. Hence, it should be government's responsibility to prevent this condition by giving a strict rule of this kind of activities.
Different methods of advertisement are used in common media and among them few are considered morally controversial and misleading. I agree with the criticism because the promotions made by companies, like tobacco and fashion industries, try to disguise social aspects, give partial information and try to trigger emotions of people to misguide their judgments.
First, misusing the freedom of the media and advertisement industry, many companies and brands have started using inappropriate ways to convince the society in buying products. For instance, tobacco companies invest millions of dollars in promotion campaigns, which often include famous celebrities, to increase the number of smokers in our community in order to maintain the flow of their sale. Thus, add-making houses are paid heavily to make the catchy scenario for the people. Therefore, most of the advertisement makers try to introduce a concept that smoking is essential to be manly and someone special. Furthermore, to make the presentation even more realistic they might end up hiring a film or sports stars. As a result, people, especially youths, get distracted.
Another feature of immorality could be seen in advertisements made by fashion and cosmetic industries. Fashion industries try to induce a specific pale zero size model image as criteria of an ideal body, which is why, in order to attain that many women, especially girls, end up in a psychological condition like anorexia nervosa or body dysmorphic syndrome. Nevertheless, academic excellence is also markedly affected by those deceptive advertisements.  Though there is no scientific evidence that a cream can make our complexion fair, this is a common scenario in an advertisement made by a beauty cream producers.
Finally, hiding real ingredients used in a product and side effects of using it is a common practice in advertisement industries. How ambiguous and confusing it is when every brand claim to be the best!  Creativity and unique concept in advertisements should be used positively- in fact, to let the consumers make informed judgments, not to deceive them.
In conclusion, I strongly agree that many advertisements we see or hear break the ethics and morality of our society. Also, the government ought to restrict certain features of freedom given to media, in particular to tobacco and fashion industries. Viewers should be presented with advertisements that are not unethical or inappropriate.

Since the dawn of time, subjects such as science, computer and music have been included in every school's curriculum. However, throughout history, music has been seen by many that studying music is not that really important compared to those two subjects. It is agreed that children must learn vital subjects like science and computer while music should just be optional.

In conclusion, learning science and computer technology are really useful in our day to day life and music is only for recreation and should just be an option in school. It has been proven that children should learn these essential subjects and music should be optional. Thus, it is recommended for the parents to encourage their children to study hard the science and computer subjects.
Essay 941:
Today, the majority of the people travel in different countries as part of their work, travel or living. But the fact is whether it bring a benefit to society or not? I would like to share my opinion in the following paragraphs.
Firstly, as people start travelling to different places, they communicate with the local people, which make it possible to understand each other and lead a good relationship. This relationship may help to bring a good understanding and bonding among the nations. Moreover, as the number of tourists increases, tourist resorts also increases, revenue collection will be increased, which reduces the burden of government barring all the expenses of the maintenance. The economic level of a country will be in a control. This not only provides financial support to the government, as a number of accommodation centre increases, need for employee also increase as a result.  The problem for unemployment can be solved, which helps in making a powerful and developed economy.
On the other side, most of the nations have their own tradition and culture. This difference is major in countries where fewer foreign tourists come to visit when compared with other countries where a large number of tourists travel and stay each year. This may create a serious issue in some places where the tradition is on the upper side. For example; the dressing style of western country differs from our nation. When they visit a sacred place such as temples, mosques or some other pilgrimage places may create some inconvenient situation for the locals. Sometimes, the situation may become worst which may result in future conflicts among the nations.
To sum up with my words, despite the drawbacks in the above paragraph, the international tourism helps to a greater extent in forming a nation and to lead a peaceful, friendly relationship among them and making the planet earth a meaningful one.
Essay 942:
In recent years, the change in spending money to buy people's needs has occurred dramatically. As a result, it always will be a controversial topic whether it is a bad or positive trend relating to the shopping habit which has become a routine task and even a hobby. This essay, as my point of view, leads to, will try to come up with several considerations as I believe that an intermediate position can be taken relating to this issue.
 Shopping, that contradicts the topic regards, is a "nightmare" because the impacts which are dire & inevitable. Consumerism, in some ways, contributes bad things to the society as well as the civilisations. People who overcapitalize their money can spend their revenues in nothing and as a result, they suffer in managing their funding and try to borrow a big amount of money for just their basic needs. Psychologists argue that addiction in shopping which creates consumerism behaviour can lead to several criminal dire effects such as robbery and stealing.
However, without shopping and its relating things governments will face the problem in controlling the economy. The thing which can grow the Gross Domestic Products indicator is expenditures, especially the private one. Without increasing in this indicator, there will be severe implications which the economist called unemployment. The improvement of spending money indicates that people in the country are wealthy and also projects the prosperity of the nation which influences the corporations to produce products in high quantity as well as high quality. Throughout this trend, the employers will try to provide immense chances for people to get their job in the corporations. As consequences, spending in buying products, even it is a hobby or not, with larger portions helps economy matters indirectly.
People used to go shopping only because of a daily needs, while recently it changes to be a kind of hobbies for people. Some state that shopping is an activity which can reduce boredom, thus it is great for people to do so. I personally believe that going shopping is not only for spending money, but you can find some benefits by doing this kind of activities. Therefore, through this essay, I will support my view with some considerations.
The first idea is that people love shopping because it can refresh their minds. By going shopping round you will be able to forget the things which burden you. For instance, young adults prefer to do the shopping after having the final examination. They will try to entertain themselves by buying something which is interesting and they will obtain a satisfaction at the time. As a consequently, they directly forget about the difficulties encountered during the exam.
In addition, going shopping is not only the case of buying something such as clothes, bags or even accessories. Shopping also means amusement in which people visit some shopping places to gather with family or friends. They just tend to spend their time in the lovely places which provide a lot of entertainments, thus they can enjoy their leisure time with full of joy and fun.
To sum up, go shopping could be a bad habit that can addict people to do so. However, Shopping is a great hobby which can help people overcoming their stress or even anxiety. It occurs because doing shopping will make them more relax and forget about their problems.
Essay 943:
It is true that the proliferation of the English language on an international scale is profoundly impacting many countries by benefiting underdeveloped nations’ businesses and tourism through globalisation and providing its people with a foundation for accessing the quality education available in developed countries. Although the drawbacks do exist, benefits are countless. I believe that the benefits of this trend have more significance than its demerits and this will continue in the coming years.  
The widespread usage of a single language, English in this case, attracts foreign investors and tourists from developed countries; promoting globalisation, and it has both advantages and disadvantages. Firstly, the economy is improved through the profitable businesses of multi-national companies. In addition to this, the tourists’ arrivals increase due to hospitality enjoyed when spoken to in a common language. Moreover, this influx increases the government’s revenue generated from the hospitality industry. On the other hand, the promotion of international businesses can harm the local business expansions. Furthermore, due to the increasing use of the English language, many local languages are getting less priority and thus impacting the cultural identity of many nations.  
English provides a solid foundation for people seeking quality education in developed countries and equips them to secure a high paying job in a multinational company. Firstly, it is the only medium of teaching instruction in the world’s top universities; an active command of the language secures an admission to a university. To add, knowledge of the language place candidates a step forward in the job hunting pool; the chances are high that the desired position is earned.
While the increasing usage of English attracts foreign businesses and tourists in underdeveloped nations, local businesses may be stifled, and natives may be undermined. However, the benefits it brings to these nations through globalisation, and their people by laying a foundation for quality education eclipse its drawbacks, which in my opinion, is a positive trend.
 Presently, English is called a universal language as half of the world population is using it. It is the gateway to the world, the ability to speak in English is considered as one of the hallmarks of a cultured person. It is undeniable to say that, global language has resulted in both positive and negative effects which must be addressed accordingly.
To begin with, there are many benefits of extending a universal language. Through global language, a particular country can develop its business relations and increase its economic growth. Professionally, in today's globalised world, those who are fluent in English have a competitive advantage over other candidates.
From the social perspective, the English language allows people to enter a wider cultural world, which helps in developing healthy relations among them. This critical ability is building a foundation for good business and social relations. The widespread use of the English language is narrowing the gap between communication and people all over the world have accepted English as a language to use for communications. The books, history and research papers written in this language are really great in number and the spread of this language has made it possible to let people around the world learn the same technology and resources.
However, one can not deny the drawbacks which are derived from global language. Adopting universal language is leading to westernisation of culture. Nowadays, people speak global language instead of their own language. As a result, they are forgetting their indigenous dialects and culture and their children are following the same. For example, Bangladesh is well-known for its culture and traditions all over the world, but, presently, many people have forgotten their culture and language.
In conclusion, I would argue that benefits created by the English language far outweigh the disadvantages of it and in future English would be spoken by far many people and would decrease the language barrier nations have.
Essay 945:
There have been always debates about how and where schools should use the available resources. One of these debates is the amount of money and time spent in teaching music. Some people would argue that teaching science or computer has a higher priority but from my point of view, I think that teaching music is as important as teaching any other subjects. In the next paragraphs, I will give my reasons to support this position.
First of all, every society consists of a variety of professions. You cannot replace a profession with a different one and expect it to function properly. For example, while you need engineers to build devices and doctors to cure people, you also need musicians and entertainers so that people can enjoy their spare time.
Second of all, every child is different and has his/her hobbies, talents and dreams. We cannot focus on certain subjects and ignore others as this will bring up generations who would know a lot of information in fields that they do not really care about. So, in order to have a successful and balanced society, we need people who have passion towards their work and this passion will not come unless we give each subject in school its amount of time and effort. This will give the children the chance to choose the field they will really excel at.
Music is very motivational and adding music classes would help children focus on other complex subjects like Algebra and Physics. Many students have a natural talent for music and the teachers would be able to identify them. Thus the possible future musician would be sorted out and nurtured. We do not need a generation full of mathematician and computer programmer. An ideal society needs musicians as much as it needs the technical persons. So music lessons in school level cannot be a waste of money and time.
Some people think that students should be taught subjects like science and computers at schools instead of wasting time and money in music and art classes. I completely disagree with this statement because students should be allowed to explore all the subject areas rather than focusing only on some limited areas.
Only studying subjects like science, maths and computers make students monotonous. As we know, these subjects are comparatively tough than other subjects. The students also try too hard on understanding those subjects to secure good grades in the examination. Sometimes, some students even lose interest in their study if they are not allowed to do any other extra activities except studying. So, there must be few extra classes for them to enjoy their day at school in spite of all the tough study they have to do.
Not all students are interested in science. Some of them might be interested in music or arts. Also, some students can be good in both science and music or arts. Having art and music classes help them to actually bring out their hidden talent in front of the whole world. Furthermore, it will give them a chance to be creative. In addition, such classes help students to decrease the stress of study. This, in turn, will help them to be focused on their study since a stress-free mind can learn things quickly and accurately.
Similarly, being in such classes not only help students to enjoy their day at school but also keep them occupied during their free time. Instead of wasting their time in watching television and playing computer games, they can practice music and art and be creative. This way they will be entertaining themselves as well as practising and enhancing perfection on what they love.
To sum up, classes like music and arts are really important for students. This should be made available in every school to motivate students in extra-curricular activities along with their study which will help them in their intellectual development.
We are usually made to learn a wide variety of subjects in our school. We practice Math for computational skills and again have to memorise past events as part of world history. Within all this, schools have made provisions for recreational activities such as musical classes. However, not every person finds such musical classes beneficial for a child.
I believe music can be an exemplary form of relaxation in the midst of a competitive school environment. Back during my high school days, I used to feel over-burdened by all the lessons in a day. I used to fervently wait for my ECA classes where we were taught how to play the cello. I still remember how every chord I used to play, removed the chaos from my mind and refreshed me. Moreover, not every student in a class aspires to be a scientist or an engineer. There are always those few, who want to dip their talent in the soothing tunes of music. Otherwise, we would never have had composers like Beethoven or even Myles Kennedy. So, those music classes could be the stepping ground for many a Barba Streisand.
Many people might argue that such classes would distract a student from their homework or project work or would take up additional time that could have been better utilised for mainstream subjects. However, I remember our school used to space our music classes in between major lessons with its duration strictly being similar to other classes. Most of my classmates used to comment on how, after our music lessons, they used to feel more invigorated or inspired to tackle their homework. So such a measure by every school could dissipate such misgivings.
A group of people believe that music course should not be included in the school curriculum, and children should focus on learning important subjects such as mathematics, science, computer and language. I personally disagree with the statement, since I believe that music plays an important part in human's life and the following essay will discuss it in details.   
Firstly, based on the reliable scientific research, it was found that the music has a positive impact on children's brain development. These scientists believe that children who play musical instruments such as piano or violin are more intelligent than the ordinary children. Children who frequently listen to music or play music instruments have a proportionate use of their left and right brain; therefore they could combine their emotional and logical thinking. One of the examples is the famous composer Mozart, who had been introduced to music since he was five years old, and became one of the greatest world composers.
Secondly, the existence of music class also plays an important role for the school and the children as well. It is a fact that each child is born with different talent and passion. Some children might be born with the interest in calculation or logical thinking, but there are others who are born with the talent in arts, such as painting, singing or playing musical instruments. Therefore the existence of musical class can be used to facilitate and develop children who have a passion for music. Besides that, music class can also be used a preparation for school performance. It is common that during a graduation ceremony, there will be some performance from children and one of them might be the choir. The music class can be used for rehearsal, therefore, the children's choir could perform well during the ceremony.
In conclusion, several people believe that musical class should be eliminated from school curriculum since it is a waste of money and time. They believe that school should focus more on useful subjects, such as biology, chemistry or mathematics.  I totally disagree with the statement, since I do believe that music can be a positive influence on the children's brain development. Besides that, it is true that every individual is born with different talent and passion; therefore schools cannot enforce children to focus on studying some particular subjects.
Essay 947:
Communication is the art of conveying expressions, emotions and feelings between individuals. As the human steps on the path to transcendence, the high-tech tries to interfere in every facet of life and facilitate the vicissitudes of it. However, the real impacts of novel technologies are a perennial debate.
First, the invention of the telegraph made our infinite world really small. So, delivering messages faster was the first stepping stone of communication technology. Second, utilising ordinary phones and some years later by cell phones, the word of loneliness was eliminated from the dictionary of a society. Third, the internet which has the most striking impact on our life makes it possible to transform a cell phone into a bank, library or a conference room. Thus, being stocked in traffic jams or breathing polluted air is not a matter due to privileges of novel technologies.
On the other hand, psychologists consider modern people an indolent species. Nowadays, we prefer using our phones instead of taking a walk to see a friend. Also, the artificial intelligence and ambience dilute the role of emotion in interacting. The amazing gadgets and fascinating communication can lead us to forget how to like and dislike. Hence, it can put us in the prison which we made and erect around us.
To sum up, although the modern technology can make far distances shorter or carry out our monotonous works faster, but we should not lose the sight of the fact that it can never transfer our feeling and emotions. Thus, a middle ground should be taken for these two approaches.
Essay 948:
It is true that jails play a vital role to decelerate the crime rates by imposing imprisonment on the offenders. Several developmental programs are provided to the prisoners to upgrade their social attitude and transform their mind towards positivity. However, many people believe that these activities do not draw benefits, rather than it is a matter of complete vain. Although, I contend opposite of the given statement and in further I will provide several advantages of the present setup of prison.
First of all, it is undeniable that, captivity helps to reduce crimes in society. Nowadays people get apprehensive to embark on any violated activity. Because the negative impacts of imprisonment are numerous. For instance, this lead to loss of social respect and captive’s family passes their days as like a terrible nightmare. Additionally. Imprisonment develops fear, guilt inside criminals mind, therefore they realise their faults and stay away from further explicable acts. Sometimes, it is also a perfect way of taking revenge for the victims.
Moreover, in present time many voluntary developmental programs and workshops are ongoing in the prisons of almost all the countries. By getting vocational training, prisoners can expect a better life outside. For example, a thief who steal someone’s belongings, in turn, to get money and food, may not engage in further crime as he has adequate skills and learnings to be employed and thus, lead a respectable life. Various educational programs can motivate and diverse the criminal attitudes towards a better life which is not only benefiting the individual but also deterring crime in the society.
To sum up, jails are one of the important parts of our community which is dealing strongly with the criminals and criminal activity, despite having any trade-off. While the recent addition of educational and developmental training programs are necessary for both individual and community.
Essay 961:
Cricket is a sport which includes two opposite teams played by 11 players on each side and it is one of the most popular outdoor sports in these modern days. The total number of audience and the importance of this game have evolved beyond boundaries in the recent times than ever, particularly in countries like India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Pakistan etc. and I believe the number of reasons contributed towards this change is numerous. But it is undoubtedly arguable that the significance of cricket has crossed as that of the national games, in almost all these countries.
Being an Indian, I would consider my self-privileged to explain what happened in India which has, in turn, helped cricket to be a celebrated game. The national sport of India is declared as hockey and India always has had a wonderful hockey team now and in the past. But it is quite evident that during the mid-80s the exposure cricket had received internationally is commendable when compared to any other sport, so as in India too. Those days, hockey was also given similar importance but with India's victory of International Cricket Council's world cup in the early 90s, the dream of an Asian country winning an international title has become a dream come true for not only Indians but also for the other subcontinents in Asia. Ever since then, the players were treated as celebrities and apparently the popularity of the game has increased and as time has passed, India became one of the most successful and a record winning team in the entire world.
Adding to the flavour, it would be insensitive, if I do not count the contributions of individual cricket players and their influence in the Indian community. Some players like Sachin Tendulkar and Saurav Ganguly has been an envied opening partnership for all other opponent countries, and they have been very successful in making and achieving new records day by day. Sachin Tendulkar alone holds more than 200 records in the game of Cricket and he is the most run scorer and century holder in all forms of cricket. Additionally, when we go back to the history of cricket it is worth mentioning that, cricket has its root of origin to England, and I presume being a colony to the English for around 200 years until 1947, cricket has got widely popularised during these days.
In summary, although, I have so many other reasons to be specifically pointed out, I consider the above said details are most significant to be told. However, I would be more than eager to witness what sport could possibly replace Cricket from its position in the future, as I believe change is inevitable and the world is dynamic.
The game of cricket has undoubtedly bowled over the native sports in the majority of the Asian and neighbouring continents. The popularity of the sport, as many suggests owes to the peculiarity of the game and the flamboyance of the players and team involved. Let us discourse the reasons below.
It is quite obvious that native sports in these countries lack the enthusiasm and some unique features which cricket does not. Moreover, national sports are not being played on a global perspective compared to cricket these days. In addition to this, the younger generations are influenced by the game of cricket from their childhood. For example, in India, seldom would you find one describe his childhood devoid of cricket. Hockey being the national sport of India, will find itself miles away on the road to popularity compared to cricket.
One other reason for its popularity would be the frequency of international tournaments or series that occur in the circle of cricket, whereas native sport does not acknowledge international viewers on such basis. As a result, cricket and its players splash around the media all the year around, making it closer the mass hearts. For example, the welcome that Australians received after winning the cricket world cup in 1996 acquired  a worldwide attention on television screens. The world witnessed India coming to a stand still on winning world cup following this.
History favours the sub-continental countries teams to procure higher rankings in the cricket hierarchy, an illustrated reason for cricket’s popularity in these continents. The fact that majority of the tournaments in world cricket hangs around the Asian subcontinent also adds to the heap of reasons. Asia cup, Sharjah cup etc. exemplifies the same.
In conclusion, the native sports are fading importance in the huge waves of roars applauding cricket. This phenomenon is getting more globalised and seems unstoppable. As a sports person myself, I opine that measures should be taken to promote the national sports because no sport is better than other unless played in the right spirit.
Essay 962:
Undoubtedly, cricket is the well- known game among all the people in subcontinent countries. Since it gives more entertainment and greater competitions, it achieved higher popularity than the national sports. This essay intends to analyse the reasons for this phenomenon in detail.
First of all, cricket is much more thrilling and interesting to watch and play for all age groups than other sports. To precise, people can be enjoyed by playing or even watching, which is the main attractive feature. For instance, in India, even though many people have busy life schedule, they are interested in watching cricket either through television or live because it gives more energy and happiness. Moreover, a lot of people including young and old find enough time to play cricket in their surroundings in spite of their unattended higher priorities. This is because of the attractive elements of cricket sport, which also enhance positive and vibrant qualities.
Secondly, it is a team sport. In other words, teamwork is essential to play cricket successfully. Many people like these types of sports rather than solitary sports as people can show their strength and unity in front of others. Furthermore, players help each other to overcome the drawbacks. Such activities develop team spirit among players considerably.
Most of the subcontinent countries including India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lana plays in international cricket and their successes in this game are tremendous. This is another reason cricket has gained a huge popularity in this part of the world. The national games like Hockey, kabaddi and volleyball are not attractive to people in these countries as there are fewer events of these games. It is obvious that mass people would show more enthusiasm in the sports where their national team play at the international level and become the best in the world.    
Finally, unlike national sports, it is very to understand and learn. To explain, rules and regulations of cricket are much easier to learn for even a common man. Therefore its’ fame has reached greater heights. This would mean that cricket is very common and popular game in the sub- continental countries.
In conclusion, despite it consumes a long time, it helps people to entertain and relax enormously than the national sports. I hope authority should consider these points and take appropriate measures to encourage people for playing national sports also.  
Essay 963:
Hailing from a country where a cricketer is popularly known as the God, I can certainly say that cricket has outshone all other sports in the sub-continental countries including the national sports. Because of the popularity of cricket, all the other sports are being neglected or less frequently played or enjoyed. Some of the reasons, in my opinion, are media coverage, the business involved in sports, training resources and government support, different format of the sport and success rate of those countries in international tournaments.  
First of all electronic and social media coverage has played an important role to make the cricket popular among the people in the sub-continental countries. In India and in other sub-continental countries, almost all national and international cricket matches are telecasted on several TV channels. Highlights of matches, cricket theme shows and interviews with the cricketers are very popular on TV. Because of this, people very seldom get a chance to know about other sports and are therefore largely unaware of them. Since the cricket teams in these countries do really well at the international level, people like to watch this sport more than they are interested in national sports. The huge success in international level is one of the most prominent reasons people in this continent like to play and watch this sport.  
Second, cricketers are treated as celebrities and they are role models for many young and aspiring cricketers. The amount of money they earn and the focuses they get on media are quite overwhelming.  Sachin Tendulkar, for example, is very commonly known as the God of cricket in India. His popularity is such that there have been riots in his name. Almost all the international cricket players have huge fans and cricketers from Indian subcontinents like Imran Khan, Tendulkar, Wasim Akram, Afridi, Kohli, Rahul Dravid, Muralidharan etc. have more fans and followers than we can imagine.  Therefore marketing companies pay them highly to endorse their products. Again, cricket is one of the highest paying sports in sub-continental countries. Money – award money, match winnings and income from endorsements of the products, is very high as compared to any other sport. So naturally, the youngsters are inclined towards playing cricket.
Moreover, training resources and government support for cricket is far more than that of national sports in these countries. Considering the commercial factor and popularity of cricket, the government also provides better facilities and resources for cricket training. There are also several private clubs and coaching centres for aspiring cricketers and current players in all major cities. Even in schools, cricket is the most encouraged and widely played sport. Finally, different formats of the sport make it more attractive to audiences of all ages. Earlier cricket used to be a winter sport, but now it is played year round. Different formats like test matches, one-day international, T-20, premier leagues and the glamour attached to this sport have enhanced the popularity of cricket than the national sports of these countries. Even many renowned movie stars are now the owners of the cricket clubs and this has further accelerated the popularity of this sport.
In conclusion, everybody wants to enjoy a sport that has glamour and excitement attached. Thus national sports in the Indian sub-continent have lost their popularity to a great extent while cricket has become the craze in the sports world.
Essay 968:
Some people think that entertainers such as film stars, pop musicians or sports stars are paid too much money and I also feel that is true. I totally agree with this thought. Let's discuss in details.
In today's world, we can categorise these entertainers are the highest earners in the society. Their earning is much higher than most of the people. This difference also leads to the making of more poor people within the society. I will describe in my view why these high salaries are unfair.Firstly, entertainers are also doing their job as other people in the world. Each and every individual in the workforce are giving some support to make the national income in a country. Therefore it is unfair to pay very big salaries to fewer people. Furthermore, payments should be done according to the job type, not considering the popularity.
Secondly, these people earn much higher than well-educated ones in the society like doctors, engineers, accountants etc. It is not the best practise knowledge and wisdom are less valued here. This will definitely discourage young people to be professionals. Thirdly, paying very high salaries to the film stars, sports stars or musicians makes an unfair situation to the poor people who are working very hard to make ends meet. Most of the government servants might not get good wages as the government cannot arrange the money since entertainers are highly paid. We should not forget that these payment made by the government from everyone's money.
To sum up I also feel that entertainers are highly paid and I think these payment systems should be done an intelligent and fairly way than this. I think salary scales must be designed very fairly than present. Wages might be plan considering various measures such as how hard is the job, educational level, profession. Moreover professionals like doctors, engineers, accountants, lecturers should be highly paid since it encourages society to be educated. But it is also should be at a balanced level.
Superstars of television, film and other media are given a big amount of money and it has become a controversial issue in the entire world. I am also in agreement with it and I would suggest that skilled workers also should be paid more. They are also real heroes of our societies. In the following paragraphs, I am going to discuss some of the reasons why we should not give too much money to the stars only for their fame.
Essay 971:
A very crucial thing for our present government is that it has a scarcity of budget, and hence they cannot fulfil all the needs of people. However, the government spends public money for the treatment of illness and for promoting the healthy lifestyle. But the fact is whether the government must spend more money on patients or to prevent illness. I would like to discuss both contexts, which are prescribed in the following paragraphs.
One of the famous proverbs said by our ancestors is - “prevention is better than cure “; it’s better to take an earlier prevention rather than suffering at a later stage. The government has to take serious action in the earlier stage, it should provide all facility to make the environment clean. It should promote people to take necessary medication for the prevention of disease such as polio, rabies, Tuberculosis etc. It should not only provide facilities but it should also encourage people to lead a healthy, sober and peaceful life.
On the other hand, it is not only important to take the prevention, but it should also take care of people who are already ill.  No all people in the society lead a same standard of living, they differ from each other. The majority of them are unable to get a simple medication for their health, hence it’s a duty of the government to provide some facility for these people. It should provide some concession or free health check-up for the people who are really unable to make it.
Essay 972:
In the modern world, we see that many people migrate to faraway places, but, for most parts of history, people mostly chose to live close to the place where they were born and bred. There could be many reasons for this, and it has both advantages and disadvantages that this essay will deal with.
Now, while there can be plenty of reasons behind people's desire to live close to their birthplace, the main reason is that it offers them a certain sense of security and comfort in their effort to survive, in an otherwise unknown world that is full of prejudiced thoughts, suspicion, hatred and animosity. People inherit property and lands where their ancestors lived, and this is another reason so many people feel connected to their birthplace where they know people and the culture to live as an integral part of society.
Now, while this sense of security and comfort in itself is an advantage of living close to someone’s birthplace in a more broad and abstract sense, some of its more tangible benefits may include the opportunity to live close to the people, we love and care for. Another advantage is that because of living close to a place of our origin for a long time, we feel that we know its air, water and landscape so well that we can rely on these things for our physical and mental wellbeing.
Of course, it has some disadvantages too. One such disadvantage would be that people, close to you, might interfere in your private matters, on and off, which can be a tad irritating at times. In fact, I have seen how one of my uncles moved far away from his birthplace because his in-laws kept meddling in his private matters against his wish. Besides, living close to where someone is born, which could also be his comfort zone, for too long might make someone a bit too lazy and scared to try new things in order to improve the quality of life and explore new opportunities.
In conclusion, most people choose to live close to where they were born because it gives them a sense of security and makes them a part of society in which they blend quite well. This can have both merits and demerits that we should consider carefully before choosing to live in that place or leave it for another place.
Essay 975:
We live in a world in which everyone is judgmental to the extent that one often makes inconsequential remarks in regards to things that does not affect one in the least bit, such as if other people are driving a Lamborgini or if they are carrying a Hermes bag. It seems as though old fashioned values such as honour, generosity, and trust do not amount to much in today's condemnatory world. Apropos of the statement, I am in part accordance with it.
It is inarguable that a staggering number of people only consider about how their connection can bring advantages to them when befriending someone. For instance, one might think twice before making friends with someone who is kind but impoverished, as there is no benefit that is likely to stem from the connection. On the flip side, ingratiating with someone who displays ostentatious wealth might be more auspicious for one in the future.
Similarly, one from a wealthy family might feel hesitant to befriend someone who is struggling to make ends meet, seeing as the latter is not on the same level with one in terms of social status. Also, there is no guarantee that one will not be on the receiving end of bullying if one befriends someone of a lower status. Case in point, kids from my school will not let Jaycea hear the end of it because she is friends with Elaine, a driver's daughter, notwithstanding the fact that Elaine is trustworthy and dependable.
On the contrast, I also believe that it is unreasonable to stereotype the whole society based on the behaviour and way of thinking of some people. Like the aforementioned case in which Jaycea is willing to befriend Elaine despite being bullied, it shows that it is possible for some people to value trust and generosity over social status.
To sum up, while it is commonplace for people to hold a higher value of material possessions and social status in this overcritical world, there are also people who value old fashioned values more and they are not to be overlooked.
It is true that people are judged based on their social status and personal wealth nowadays, and traditional values such as integrity and honesty are being forgotten. To a certain extent, I would agree with the fact that people are valued based on their wealth and status these days, but I also believe that old fashioned values still plays an important part in our societies.
It is believed that we are living in the pop culture and materialistic era these days, as the public judge each individual based on his/her social status and wealth. It can be seen from how celebrities become famous nowadays. Many celebrities are being popular because of their physical appearance and personal wealth such Kim Kardashian. Her reality television program never shows any world class acting quality, but only shows about her luxurious mansions and fancy cars. And then there are other celebrities who are well known due to his/her social status as the son or the daughter of a wealthy family. One of the examples would be Paris Hilton. Although she has many bad attitudes, she is still popular because she inherits the assets of her parents.
Although traditional values such as respect others, being responsible, honesty and integrity seem to be forgotten nowadays, but they still play an important part in many communities. In common cases, employers are still assessing their potential employees based their hard working attitude, positive behaviour and their integrity. And then business people are still looking for business partners who are reliable, can be trusted, and dependable. Therefore, it is important for adults to educate their children about these positive values because they still play an essential part in the societies.
In conclusion, even though people are judged based on their wealth and social status nowadays, but I do believe that old fashioned values such as honour, respect and trust cannot be eliminated from our daily lives. Therefore we must teach our young generation about these cultures, in order for them to survive and succeed in the future. 
Essay 977:
In the current world, international marketing is certainly believed as an introducing an illegal aspect into the economy of the host country. However, it is often considered by some that such type of marketing is significant for the economic form of knowledge as well as exchanging diverse culture, languages and customs. In my opinion, I strongly believe that international marketing promotes globalisation by opening new opportunities in future business and thus improve economic growth.
International marketing has several advantages. Firstly, enhancing economic growth of the country would often be promoted by global marketing. In other words, it certainly opens new doors for future business. For instance, recent studies show that there should certainly a considerable growth in the field of international trade in electronic gadgets from countries such as Russia and China. In addition, International marketing often explores inner talent of citizens across the globe.
Moreover, improving the brand reputation of the product would certainly have another plus point of the international business because product brands often gain reputation and popularity across the world. Multinational banks often attained reputation in the current scenario. Hence, local brands of the country would probably become familiar across the world by international marketing.
Furthermore, spreading of ideas, customs, tradition and language would often possible by global trade, thus spreading diverse culture throughout the world. World food products in popular supermarkets such as Tesco and Asda would often show an example of global business networks, therefore, introducing global food into the country’s local trade market.
In conclusion, international marketing should be promoted through the world for improving economic knowledge as well promoting different culture worldwide. Such promotion of international marketing should often possible without interrupting nation own local culture and trade by making awareness among citizen about its advantages.
Essay 978:
The world has become a small global village due to the increasing international trade opportunity. As this facilitates numerous people to earn their bread and butter, avail global products in a marketplace, creates more opportunity for trade and marketing, and demolish monopoly in business, this is spreading faster than ever before. However, there are some who opine that international marketing is like an encroachment to a country’s own trade, policy, tradition, culture and freedom. In my view, international marketing really benefits the masses and offer countless advantages.
Many prominent reasons are present for my opinion. First and foremost, international marketing enhances the relationship among nations as it invites other countries to invest and do business. This is beneficial for making a stronger bonding among nations. For example, many Asian countries now have a better relationship with Western countries due to the open international market. Secondly, international marketing provides everything for the commonality, even those things which they can not buy from their local market. Consumers, these days, have many choices and they can pick from many international brands. Third, this phenomenon offers better product quality at a competitive price. For example, we can get products from different brands in our local market easily these days and if I personally compare the prices of many of these products with the past, it has dropped due to the increasing competition.  Another significant benefit it offers is the reachability of our local products  in the international market.
As every garden has weeds so as with the international marketing. Many local traders and the vendors face difficulties because they often fail to attract the consumers. The buyers like to go to the international malls and like to purchase the branded items rather than locally made products. In a way, this kills many local businesses. Finally, the international marketing and trade facilities often negatively affect the traditional ways of life and culture. For instance, the traditional Japanese lifestyle and unique culture have greatly been affected by many Western cultures and open market and international market is two of the key reasons for this shift.
All in all, it can be enclosed that undoubtedly the world today is a common marketplace for every nation and it is impossible to remain unaffected by the impacts of the international marketing; practically which has more positive than negative consequences.
Essay 989:
English is one of the most widely spoken languages around the world and it is indeed regarded as the "international language". It has taken the world by storm and everyone around the globe striving hard to master this language. Take the example of China, where you have the largest English speaking population. Some would suggest that the best way to learn a foreign language is by learning in the country where the language is being used as the natural choice. But in my view, there are several other options available to conquer the skill of English conversation.
Learning English in your home country seems to be more viable and economical when compared to the option of going out in native English speaking countries. For instance, now there is a plethora of world renowned English teaching institution available across all over India in every nook and corner. So now it is easier to access these facilities and indeed these resources are quite affordable taking into consideration the fierce competition they need to tackle. Another feasible option is that now English teachers from around the globe have now started imparting their lessons on English via their websites. Some do it for free and sometimes you need to enrol for some online course by paying a fee. In terms of resource, there is an abundance of the same in the country itself. So going abroad for this doesn't seem rationale.
Some would argue that being with native speakers in their country will certainly ensure an environment conducive to learn English in a faster and more efficient way. But you can simulate these environments here in your country as well by practising this language with the people you encounter on daily basis. In case there are fewer people to talk to, then there are numerous speaking communities available on the internet consisting of native English speakers.
In short, the same experience that you'll get while learning in an English speaking country can be replicated in your country thanks to growing popularity of this language and the availability of internet around the globe.
Essay 998:
The environment has become a major concern over the last couple of decades, resulting in several debates on who should be responsible for ensuring its sustenance for our future generations. In this essay, we will discuss the point of views for establishing where the responsibility for the protection of the environment lies.
There is a strong argument that individually we cannot contribute materially to the cause of preserving our environment because it encompasses several areas where individual efforts become futile. Some examples are factories that are emitting hazardous gases in our air or dumping dangerous materials in our rivers. If we want to take this up as an individual we cannot be expected to be able to prevent this from happening. One could argue that if each shareholder puts pressure on the companies that they own this could lead to building up of pressure for being more responsible, this, unfortunately, is not workable because usually the companies are mostly owned by funds that are managed by professionals, seeking profit and environment is very low on their priority list.
The above leads us to deduct that if this movement of preserving our environment is a collaborative effort by the government and general public we stand a better chance of being successful. The government should provide the legal infrastructure to control the natural instinct of profiteering of all investment institutions; with this, the individual efforts could start making the difference. Continuing the above example if an individual member of the society notices that same happening in his or her surroundings, he or she can call on an implementation agency that would tackle the factory emitting hazardous gases and dumping dangerous materials. Examples of these implementation agencies include Environment control desk in the city office, environmental inspectors who randomly visit such factories and are empowered under the law to impose a fine or completely seal the production facility found in violation of the rules.
The responsibility surely seems to be tilting towards the actions of individuals supported through government agencies and legislative framework, thus, in my opinion, the combined efforts of the government and public would be more effective. This should not, however, be interpreted as being absolved from keeping our environment clean and we can through cans and other non-degradable materials on the beach.
In the contemporary world, the concern for the degrading environment is at the peak. Some people believe it is difficult for an individual to make a difference, while others feel it cannot be solved without authorities intervening in the matter. This essay will discuss both sides in-depth and will also state why I strongly agree that the government have an indispensable role in such matters.
To begin, many believe the task of saving mother nature is tedious for a single person. But if we introduce minor alterations to our day-to-day activities, we could probably eradicate the detrimental causes to our environment. For instance, we can always bring along a recycling bag while shopping so that usage of the plastic bag would decrease. These will definitely help in minimising the air pollution caused by burning plastic bags. Thus, such actions from an individual could lead to a healthy environment.
In contrast, to individual actions, governments also play a vital role in providing checks to many such activities disrupting our ecosystem. Governments can impose stringent rules to be followed by its people. For example, the usage of plastic bags should be completely banned in the country, and this can only be forced by authorities. These regulations require judiciary powers to implement which reside with the respective officials. For this reason, the government plays the cardinal part in a process of abolishing effects causing damage to nature.
To conclude, environmental degradation is increasing at an enormous rate. These problems should be tackled with the collaboration of an individual along with governments. Would it be ungreat? I firmly acknowledge the governments have a prominent role in resolving these issues.
Essay 999:
In today’s modern world, we are constantly confronted with the issue of environmental problems which are becoming more severe nowadays in the newspaper. Some people are of the opinion that individuals can hardly make a change to environmental problems, while some believe that governments can help in solving environmental issues. I strongly agree that governments do play an indispensable role in tackling these problems.
Some people think that the environmental problems are not an easy task for individuals to deal with, but in fact, we can actually take up some good habits which could prove useful in dealing with environmental problems. For example, we can always bring along recycle bags with us so that we can cut down the usage of plastic bags. It can be clearly seen that individuals can actually contribute to helping reduce environmental issues as fewer plastic bags being used means that less air pollution which is caused by the burning of plastic bags in the rubbish dump sites.
It is certainly true that environmental problems cannot be solved without the help of governments. To begin, governments have more power than individuals in coping the environmental problems. They can, for instance, set up laws that ban the emission of wastes from factory directly into the air and watercourses. As a consequence, less air pollution and water pollution guarantee the good health of citizens. By doing this, citizens will be healthier and they can now live in a pollution-free country.
In conclusion, environmental problems should be tackled immediately with the cooperation of individuals and governments. I believe that the environmental problems will be solved one day and our country will continue to prosper and flourish in the years to come.
Essay 1000:
Pollution becomes a major concern in society all over the world. In society, not only an individual but also groups of people live. In society, it is everyone’s responsibility to protect the environment. Environmental problems caused by pollution, for example, fuel gases, cutting of trees, gases released by factories. The government should take responsibility to reduce pollution in order to protect the environment.
Every individual who is leaving in society should take responsibility to participate in protecting the environment. Firstly, people should grow trees in their houses, premises and colonies. By growing trees there are huge advantages, for example, most of the polluted gases took over by trees and they release the oxygen. Everyone should not throw the wastages on the roads, maintain a healthy environment by using the dustbins.
At the same time if we consider the government’s role: the government have authority to protect the environment. By planting the trees all over the places, for example, all government places, besides the roads, schools, and parks etc., what I know this type of programme called a clean and green environment. Thus the pollution can be controlled.  Cleanliness is very important to maintain a healthy environment, hence government should emphasise the cleaners to clean the area thoroughly. Should place the dustbin every street and educate the individuals by advertisements. Inspect the houses every month to check how the individuals maintain their houses so that the individuals reflect themselves and self-correct themselves. Conduct environmental talks in the school, that individual learns everything from childhood onwards in the school.
I believed that it is every individual’s responsibility to solve the environmental problems, however, impossible for only one individual in the society. So that government should take actions to solve the environmental problems but encourage every individual to takes part in all those activities.
Environmental problems have dramatically increased over the last few years. A rapid increase in population and other problems such as pollution, deforestation, global warming etc. have further exacerbated the situation. Some people argue that these problems are too large to be addressed by an individual being. I believe that it is a mutual responsibility of both individuals and countries to take pragmatic measures for its solution.
Overpopulation is one of the pivotal reasons that have detrimental effects on the environment. Increase in population demand more food resources, living space and other basic amenities of life. For instance, for the sake of accommodation many natural parks and forests have been wiped out to fulfil the need for living space. This has lead to severe consequences that could damage both the people and the environment.
Individual efforts can contribute a lot to address the pressing environmental problems. Steps taken at an individual level can be an effective solution for the world. For instance, if the government of a country takes initiatives to reduce the rubbish produced daily, can’t do much. However, if the citizens take effort from their personal level, rubbish production could be controlled tremendously. Similarly, if the administration of a country starts planting trees, the effort would not go further without the collaboration of the individuals.
Pollution is also a great menace to the environment. It is not only the reason of environmental problems but also has a dire effect on people. Factories operating within cities emit dangerous smoke and other harmful toxins, which are enormously affecting people health and making them more susceptible to diseases. Furthermore, pollution also contributes to global warming. There has been a drastic increase in temperature around the globe, which in turn, melts glaciers across the world. These are no longer national issues and all the governments of the world should work together to address this pressing problem. That is why prudent decisions are required from the government level and the ordinary citizens should be encouraged and participate in every way possible to make the world a better place to live in.
To sum up, I would like to say that environmental problems should be addressed on a large scale. Everyone has to contribute in order to mitigate its vulnerable effects on the world. Even a little effort by an individual can make a huge difference.
Essay 1002:
Based on the social community research, it is found that most of the criminals, who have been released from prisons, have the tendency to commit crimes again. The following essay will discuss in details about the various factors that have caused the situation and some of the ways to address the issue.
To begin with, many criminals who have finished their punishment period in jails have the tendency to do crime activities again. Based on the research of these convicts, it is found that most of these people have difficulties in finding employments when they are back in communities. When employers see their track records, they would be straightly rejected since many employers have the perception that an ex-criminal is a negative person. As a consequence, many of these people have committed crimes again in order for them to survive.
However, there are some ways in which communities and governments could do to solve the problem. Firstly, convicts should be equipped with some useful skill for them during the detention period. Therefore when they are released, they would be beneficial for societies and communities. One of the examples would be by providing some technical courses such as plumbing or mechanical courses. Secondly, the government and neighbours should cooperate in establishing cooperative institutions, whereas, they will hire or recruit ex-criminal persons. These institutions could provide services to societies as  a mechanical workshop, saloon or cleaning service facilities.
In conclusion, it is a fact that many criminals, who have been released from jails, are mostly doing criminal activities again. They do that because they feel that they are not welcomed by the public. And to cope with the issue, governments and societies should cooperate in providing some skill and workplaces for these ex-crime persons.      
Essay 1006:
This is the era or globalisation and world trade and business. This has enabled us to keep better diplomatic and business relationship with many other countries and products produced in a country could easily be found in another country.  However, this requires the products and foods to be travelled to a long distance before reaching to the consumers of other countries and this has both negative and positive consequences. In my opinion, this has far more advantages than the drawbacks.
On one hand, a country should first try to be self-sufficient rather than relying heavily on imported goods. Foods, vegetables and fruits should not be imported from other countries since the long distance travel of such commodities degraded their food values. Moreover, importing from other countries is quite costly. Finally, a country should try to produce daily necessities by themselves as it would eradicate the poverty, unemployment and would also make sure the better economic progress of a country.
On the contrary, the advantages of the global economy and trade are highlighted often and it is true that being self-sufficient for all countries are quite impossible. Some countries are better for agriculture, some for industrial productions, some for food processing and some others for technologies and thus each nation has their unique ability to do well in some specific sectors. Thus no country can locally produce everything their people need. First and foremost advantages of importing products from other countries is that a country can enjoy those short of goods without even producing them. For instance, many countries enjoy tea and coffee even though they do not locally produce them. Second, sometimes importing is less expensive than producing something and not every country has the environment and manpower to do so. Third, transportation system nowadays is becoming more efficient and in the near future, it will take less time to supply goods from another country to another. The global economy enables a country to export products to other nations rather than wasting them and this has proven to be a strong revenue earning area for many countries. People nowadays have more choices of their products and global economy hit the monopoly so hard that people can enjoy global branded products at a competitive price.
Essay 1007:
Brain drain is a much-debated issue and many people believe that developed countries should not provide work for skilled professionals from developing or poor nations since they are better utilised in the homeland. I personally believe that this system should be stopped as it would make poor countries poorer while rich countries would be richer in long run.
First, poor countries can produce only a handful number of talented people each year through their broken economic and educational system. The government and public money are spent to support those students and professionals and when they are ready to serve the country, rich nations actually hijack them. This is quite unethical and a majority of the migrated professionals serve the migrated countries than the countries they were born. This system allows the developed countries to have a large number of talented professionals, scientists, writers, engineers, doctors and so on while poor countries suffer from the scarcity of such experts. These talented and qualified people are the keys to the development of a poor country and they should serve their motherland.  
Second, a developed country already has a large number of skilled labours and expert workers and they can do quite well without alluring skilled professionals to come and work there.  For instance, the number of native astronomers and scientists in the United States is already huge and they could easily do without brain draining talented and skilled professionals from other countries. Rich countries have a natural obligation to actually send their proficient workers to work and train citizens of poor nations for the betterment of the world. Employing skilled labours from other countries is actually a practice that ruins the equilibrium of development in the world.
Finally, many skilled labours that migrate to the first world countries often end up working in a sector which is simply irrelevant to their education and skill and hence is a wastage of talent and time. For instance, many doctors and engineers in first world countries actually work in a restaurant or drive a cab only because they were migrated from poor countries and failed to show their worthiness. They could have better serve the humanity by being enrolled in their original professions in their homelands.
Essay 1010:
It is believed that students who come from a low-income family background or remote areas find some difficulties in continuing their undergraduate and graduate studies, therefore it is suggested that college and universities should provide special pathways for them. To a certain point, I would agree with the statement, but there should be additional requirements that these students must fulfil and the following essay will discuss it in details.
On the one hand, many students who come from a poor family or live in a rural area found some difficulties in entering universities. It is mostly due to the low quality of secondary education. The low-class students could only enrol to low-quality schools, while for those who live in remote areas, they are taught by junior teachers, who are still gaining some teaching experiences. As a result, they could not get the maximum quality education that they should get, and could not compete with other students when they participate in the registration test for entering universities. Therefore, it is suggested that post-secondary institutions should allocate some seats and provide some subsidy for them.
However, despite the special pathways, the institutions should provide some entry tests and academic background checking for these students. Universities must ensure that these students have some potential and eagerness to learn, and they have good academic scores in their secondary school studies, therefore the allocated seats and subsidised funds would not be a waste. This filter is a must since many of these students are entering universities but they are serious about learning and studying.
In conclusion, it is a fact that students from low economy background or live in rural areas find difficulties in entering post-secondary schools. Many people suggested that these institutions should give special pathways for them. I do agree with the statement, but some test should be given to these students, therefore only those who are serious in studying will be enrolled.
Essay 1012:
A group of people believe that scientific approaches and advanced technology in agriculture activities brings a lot of benefits for societies, while others still maintain traditional ways. Both views have their own advantages and disadvantages, and the following essay will discuss in details, but in my personal opinion, I do believe that the old-fashioned ways are better.
To begin with, many farmers are using technology and scientific approaches to managing their farms these days. They believe that by using technology such as tractors and dozers or using advanced chemical fertiliser, it will increase their productivity. However, many people do not realise that the usage of these advanced technological approaches has some side effects. For example, many fruits and vegetables that use pesticides have caused allergic diseases in human beings. And then, the over usage of pesticides in farming has made pests became more immune and made the ecosystem became imbalanced.
On the other hand, some farmers are still using the old-fashioned ways. They manage their plantations using traditional tools such as using cows, horses and traditional carts. And they prefer to use natural seeds, rather than using special seeds, which was created by scientists. Although the productivity of these farms is definitely lower, they generate healthier foods for mankind. As a result, many people prefer to purchase organic fruits and vegetables nowadays, as they realise that qualities of these organic foods are better than the industrialised ones.
In conclusion, it is a fact that some farmers are in favour of using advanced technology and scientific approaches in handling their farms, while others still use the traditional ways. Both approaches have their own benefits and drawbacks, but in my opinion, traditional ways are still better than the modern one, as organic foods are healthier for consumption.
Essay 1013:
This global population explosion has reduced the farming lands and has overwhelmingly increased the demand for food. To accord with the demand, many have already adopted intensive animal farming and creation of fruits while others still follow the traditional ways of farming. Both approaches have merits and drawbacks but to feed the hungry mouths, scientific approaches to produce more food should be welcomed with proper research.
To begin with, traditional farming produces fresh and hygienic food that have a proper nutrition. This approach also keeps the land fertile and do not make animal stocks that have been genetically modified. Consuming farm-fresh fruits and organic food is the secret to have a healthier life. However, the food production in this procedure is costly and sluggish.   
On the contrary, the world population has already reached to over 7.6 billion and it is increasing rapidly. More population means fewer lands for cultivation. From this regards, I believe that scientific methods for producing more food at a reduced price is a timely demand. Intensive animal farming or industrial livestock production maximize production while minimizing production costs and this is a necessary step to feel the global food demand, I believe. To cite an example, the majority of the rural households in developing countries had farming lands and animal stocks to meet the demand for the family. These lands are shrinking to accommodate new family members and most of these households now rely on food items purchased from the market. If farmers do not adopt technology and scientific methods to produce more, people would starve. 
To conclude, we should employ scientific methods to support the development of agriculture at the current era where food demand is higher than any other time in the history, but proper research should be in place to ensure hygiene and quality of these productions.
Essay 1017:
Roads are indispensable for an effective transportation system for the public. Though there are other modes of transportation, road system occupies the paramount place due to its convenience and less cost. Some people think that the government should pay for the road system, while others are on the view that drivers or car owners should responsible for it. This essay examines both these aspects.
On the one hand, there are some grounds to support the view that drivers should pay on the road system. Firstly, drivers will become more responsible. That is, if they have to pay for road transport, it creates the feeling of ‘ours’ and as a result, they avoid harsh driving and become more concern about roads. Another important benefit is that it may cause a decline in the number of drivers. To make it clearer, when drivers should pay for the road system, people depend on public transport in order to reduce financial loss. Hence the number of private vehicles decreases.
On the other hand, it is quite easy to understand the reasons for the government should pay on the road system. Primarily, it is the responsibility of the government should spend money on the road system. Because public pay tax amount and this money should be used for their development itself. Secondly, if the government is responsible, it leads to a wide range of developments and aids in communication and transportation in the public and national prosperity is the end products. Moreover, the government can use modern technology as large-scale projects in order to improve the road system and in turn it helps the public. In addition, people can reduce the burden on them when a government spends on these public activities.
To conclude, when we weigh both aspects, it is crystal clear that the government can spend more effectively and efficiently for the road system rather than the drivers. But every person should work hand in hand and along with authority to maintain proper transportation methods.
Essay 1030:
Pollution is one of the serious threats which have pernicious influences on our environment and people. It is a common and widely discussed issue of whether we should reduce the number of tourist flights to reduce pollution. This essay examines the pros and cones of this and draws a reasonable conclusion.
On the one hand, there are some strong grounds to support the opinion of reducing the number of tourist flights to control air pollution. Firstly, air flights not only causes air pollution, but it also contributes to noise pollution. Hence it affects the environment as well as people at the same time. Another important reason is- it is not always income-generating, while it depends on seasons and it may lead to economical losses.
On the other hand, it is fairly easy to understand the reasons for not reducing tourist flights with the view of pollution control. Firstly, it is not only the reason for pollution. Also reducing tourist flights does not have an impact on pollution. However, we adopt other possible strategies to limit pollution. Primarily, we should develop technologies to build neat and clean flights especially with any technology to cap the carbon emission which is the prime cause of air pollution. Secondly, we can alter the schedule and number of tourist flights. To make it clearer, arrange these flights in such a way that it could reduce financial loss. Thus we can arrange more flights in the appropriate seasons with correct destinations.
To conclude, when we analyse the different aspects, it is proved beyond doubt that we should not reduce the number of tourist flights rather arrange in a systematic and accessible way to increase national economy. The government should implement better strategies to boost our prosperity.
Essay 1035:
Crime is a serious problem across the globe and all countries are trying to deal with this pressing issue. A section of the society believe that prison sentences for a longer duration can help reduce the crime, whilst others disagree and argue that there are other better ways to solve this. This essay agrees with the argument that alternative ways such as educating people and giving them resources to earn are far more beneficial than confining them to a prison cell. This essay will discuss both points of view.
To begin with, many people believe that offenders should be punished with long prison sentences because this phenomenon can invoke fear among other criminals. In other words, if a person is already aware of the intensity of punishment before committing any crime, it will discourage him from becoming a criminal. For example, in the UAE, the rapist and the murderer usually get lifetime prison sentences, resulting in making people think twice before committing any serious crime. Hence, imposing strict punishment deters people from committing atrocities.
However, I believe that alternative ways such as providing proper education facilities and employment can solve the issues far more effectively. Sufficient education and job opportunities keep the masses busy and away from crimes. To exemplify, in Sweden education is free for everyone and the country’s authority is continuously working for more employment opportunities. That is the reason why Sweden tops the list of peaceful countries where the crime rate is almost ignorable.
In conclusion, longer prison terms certainly instil fear in the minds of potential criminals and discourage them from committing offences. However, eradicating the root cause of crime by providing education and employment opportunities is a far better option.
Essay 1036:
In the modern century, the world suffers from the increase of crime rate throughout many nations. This eventually breeds the fear of innocent civilians and forces them to demand stronger punishment on those who committed a crime. Some insist giving prisoners longer prison sentence, and others insist alternative ways will be more effective and I lay my thoughts alongside the alternative ways as well.
There are many benefits of sentencing offenders longer prison period. The longer the criminals who committed serious damage to others such as steal, violence, arson and murder are separated from the society, the higher the chances of the innocence being safe increases dramatically. During the time in prison, the offenders will have an opportunity to get them rehabilitated through many services available inside. For instance, they could reflect their own behaviour and educate themselves the way not to re-offend once they are released. Moreover, this long period of the prison sentence will work as a deterrent to future criminals.
On the other hand, others argue that there are more effective ways to reduce the crime rate. They insist that sparing their life after committing serious crimes involving one’s life will be only wasting the tax that citizens paid. Hence to sentence to death will show a powerful warning to other, which result in a stiff drop in crime rate. In my opinion, these people can be of the service to the whole community during their imprisonment. The labour force from these criminals will be a great contribution to the societies. It does not imply that these violent and dangerous people will be released and walk around the inner city freely. They will be under heavy supervision. For example, they will be tied to the heavy chains and placed in construction sites to assist the building companies or they could be working as farmers when the harvesting season comes.
To summarise, there are clear grounds both for and against long imprisonment. Thus the government must protect innocent lives from brutal and reckless criminals by researching the best method out of all these fine arguments.
Crime levels have been increasing at an exorbitant rate in the recent decades. The methods with which to kerb the rising levels of crime are often a debated topic. Some argue that the best way to reduce delinquency is to give longer prison sentences, while others contend that there are better alternatives to tackle this epidemic. Both sides of this debate will be analysed in this essay before a reasoned conclusion is drawn.
Many believe that handing out longer jail sentences is the right measure to be employed, this makes sense as the main purpose of such punishments is to deter individuals from committing crimes in the first place. For instance, Saudi Arabia, where ramifications for committing a crime are much harsher than the rest of the world, has much lower crime rates than even the most developed nations. This example illustrates the fear that harsher sentences can instil in the hearts of potential criminals. Hence, it is obvious why this point of view has garnered support.
On the contrary, some argue that there are better alternatives than longer prison sentences such as educational programs and community services. Take a study conducted by a non-profit organisation in my area, for example, which found out that people become more empathetic after spending time with people from disadvantaged backgrounds. As a result of this increased sympathy, people are less likely to commit heinous crimes. Therefore, it is comprehensible why this is a popular opinion among many.
After musing upon both sides of this argument, it is felt that a balance should be struck between handing out longer prison sentences and other measures. It is hoped that felony rates will be decreased in the coming years and the world will become a safer place to live in.
Essay 1037:
Planet earth is filled with love, sorrows, sufferings, thrilling moments and adventures and so on. With the passage of the time, we are falling deep into our own world and have stopped thinking about our future and generations to follow. Few people believe that our present is of vital significance, others, however, argue that we should focus more on our future. This essay will analyse both views before presenting an opinion.
Without any doubt, our present is very important as things we plan, decisions we make and measures we take now have long-term benefits to our future generations. People believe that one should do efforts to make the present time better and people should not worry about the future which no can predict to perfection. Efforts should be made to utilise the current time for the betterment of individuals and society as a whole. Moral lessons and virtuous deeds taught today will make our children valuable citizens in future. Moreover, the present time quickly becomes the past and will not be repeated. People sometimes regret not enjoying a particular moment or even more as they were busy or distracted by other things at that time.
On the contrary, few people believe that we should plan for our future as it is vital for our survival. Proponents of this viewpoint say that we should define policies and regulations to bring improvement to our core system including transportation, power distribution, air travel, housing and so on. These improvements will have significant value in future. For instance, efforts should be made to improve the education system at the grass root level so that we have more brilliant and talents students which will our future prospect. Our future not only depends on the measure and steps taken at the national level but we have to think and work on an individual basis to improve our future. Individuals should take part in community welfare service, for instance, they can take the responsibility to educate a child or provide employment to poor and needy people. These actions will make them better citizens who are the future of our society. 
To recapitulate, the aforementioned provide plausible arguments in favour of both views. However, in my opinion, both present and future have equal importance as we reap in future what we sowed in the past.
Essay 1038:
It is undeniable fact that motivation often helps to encourage people and it has been in vogue recently at a workplace, which is applied by employers to uplift the performance of employees. Therefore, each organisation uses diverse methods to encourage workers like incentives, money. However, only money cannot be the best way all the time for everyone.
On one hand, employees who have financial goals will be reinforced easily by money. The first and foremost case is that money is acceptable for many workers. One good illustration is that everyone works to earn the livelihood. Consequently, extra money motivates people to work extra. Make one more case that money is a simple way to reward people. It is obvious that workers would compete to raise productivity or standards. Hence, the company’s ranking and revenue will improve.
On the other hand, some people hold the opinion that money does not always work. To begin with, if employees are highly paid then money may not be sufficient. Thus, employees will prefer other benefits. For instance, an award ceremony or dinner, club membership, travel ticket, car and so on. Moreover, money may set employees against each other, leading to conflict in the office. Therefore, it is difficult to determine standard or basis for the decision to reward an employee.
To sum up, I would like to say there are many other ways to motivate people because amount may not bear relation to what the employee does. Companies should maintain certain rules for employee reinforcement.
Essay 1039:
Developed nations are often seen providing economic assistance to the third world nations. However, it does not always help in reducing poverty and therefore it is argued that less affluent nations must be provided with an alternatives form of aid. This essay discusses why poor countries can be better off from such assistance and types of help that can be offered.
One of the main reasons why developing nation should be assisted in other ways is because money can solve problems only for the temporary period. It is not a long-lasting approach to tackling poverty. To illustrate, a developed nation can build schools for poor nations but the expenses that incur later in regards to student's fees and teacher's wages may force to close the institution. This is because foreign aid may not be able to support for longer periods. Thus, it is highly essential that developed countries should find alternatives when helping the poorer nations.
There are different kinds of aids that affluent nations can provide to address this problem. First and foremost, young people could be given necessary training in various fields such as technology, modern agriculture, teaching, technical skill, communication etc. This helps them to find employment in their own countries or they can apply jobs to other rich nations. Another important option is investing in prosperous and promising sectors in the poor nations. If first world nations such as the USA opens its companies in third world countries like India, Pakistan, Nepal etc. many people can be highly benefited as such industries can create many local jobs.
In conclusion, there are many advantages if rich nations can provide alternative forms of aids instead of capital because financial support is only the short term approach to tackling the issue. In future, it is suggested that such new approaches need to be continued.
Essay 1041:
We often hear of an escalating trend in children leading to feeble lifestyles in media. Although many believe that both parents and educational institutes share equal responsibility in addressing this growing problem, I disagree and feel that it is the utmost responsibility of the parents to change the unhealthy etiquette of adolescents.
Being the primary caretakers, parents spend most of the time with their children and parent's eating habits influence them. Parents can become the role model for their children, by making healthy choices of what nutritious food they should have and physical activities to participate in that will main the equilibrium in life. For instance, if children observe that their parents prefer nutritious meal over junk food, exercise regularly to remain fit and participate in different sporting events or physical activities, child habits will change for the better. Being the guardian and mentor they can be very effective than schools in changing their lifestyle.
Furthermore, teaching institutes are primarily focused on providing elementary education to the students. Their job is to concentrate more on improving their skills, team building, help them in their coursework and develop their personality.  They usually have less time to look into their dietary plans or how they behave at home. Moreover, they cannot control what a child does in their spare time.
To conclude, I believe that only parents can effectively address the unhealthy ways of living of children. As primary caretakers, they are close to their children and their responsibility is more than that of schools.
Essay 1043:
As a part of the population in a country grows older, the issue of who should take care of the old population has been up for debate. Some believe that the family should take care of the old people while others believe that the government should take responsibility for their old citizens. I believe that the government and the family both have equal responsibility towards the aged population and instead of looking at the moral issues; we need to focus on what is better for them.
There are many families who are willing but are unable to look after their old parents and relatives due to certain factors such as poor financial situation. On the other hand, we have some families who capable but are just unwilling to look after their old ones due to various reason such as ideological differences etc. In both of those cases, I think it's better for the government to take the responsibility and look after the aged family members since the whole issue is how can we make sure those individuals live their remaining life comfortably. Forcing the families that just can't or aren't willing to look after their old members will only make the situation worse for the people we're trying to help.
On the other hand, we have lots of families which are both capable and are more than happy to look after their loved ones once they grow older. Well in those cases, the solution is quite clear and there seems to be no reason for the government to interfere.
All in all, I think that the issue of who should look after the old population depends on those factors listed above and our policy must act in the interest of the old population so that they can enjoy their rest of the remaining years of their life.
Essay 1044:
It is observed that the success of any organisation is dependent on the employees of that business. However, different individuals have varied opinions about the peer group to be employed. According to one camp, mature workers are valuable to the company, while according to other camp, freshers are more beneficial. Both these views will be critiqued before reaching the reasoned conclusion.
On the one hand, there is a group of individuals who argue that elder workforce is advantageous for the firm. The main reason for this belief is the amount of knowledge and experience gained by these employees in their job tenure. Having a full understanding of the system used within cooperation will not only help them to take accurate decisions, but also help them to identify pitfalls at a much earlier stage. Thus, it is apparent that such capable group of employees can add a positive value to the company's growth.
On the other hand, some argue that freshers play a significant role in the growth of industries. These undeveloped bodies are fresh to the market and, thereby, are flexible enough to adapt the changes within a company. In addition to this, these forces are always eager and willing to learn and therefore, bring new ideas and perspectives to the workplace. Thus, the theory that employing youth in enterprises is worthwhile is difficult to debunk.
After analysing these two points, it is believed that both of these generations have their own important roles in the company's progress. It is thus hoped that organisations will employ an equal number of junior and senior people in order to experience stable growth.
Essay 1045:
It is unanimously agreed that games are deemed to be the first entertainer for humans all over the world. Some people assume that such games are essential for both adults and children. However, other people believe that games are only meant to be for children. For many reasons, which will be mentioned below, I strongly reckon that games are supposed to be only for children.
Firstly, we all know that games waste the time and divert the person from his aims in life. Therefore, when adults use these games, their times will be spent aimlessly. Moreover, they will not achieve their goals in life due to those silly games. For example, my brother, who is a university student, is immensely engrossed in those games and he spares no time for his study. As a result, his marks are always low and he cannot do anything about that.
Secondly, it is generally admitted that all kinds of games are designed only for entertainment. Accordingly, such adults who play these games will focus only on joyfulness and trivial things. Additionally, they will pay no attention nor take care of what is important or useful for them. Hence, those adults, in future, will be without aims or goals to achieve and their interests will be lightened only on these trivial things.
On the other hand, children are allowed to play these games because they have no responsibility to overtake or ambition to reach. Additionally, children are not blamed when they play games since these games are the only thing children can do. Also, instead of wasting their times with bad friends, children had better enjoy and spend their times on games.
To sum up, games should only be attributed to children. Unlike children, adults have responsibilities to take many responsibilities and set goals to go ahead. No matter how difficult this opinion would be for the adults, yet they will know and realise this notion in their future. Applying the above, adults will be with a good mentality and will positively contribute to the growth of their communities.
Essay 1087:
TV, as a learning tool, is quite useful if children watch the right programmes for a certain duration of time each day. Though some people regard watching the TV as a waste of time, I do believe that this can be a very powerful learning tool for children and that is why they should be allowed to watch TV programmes both at home and school, but within the teacher's and parent's watch.
To begin with, though I am no longer a student, I can still learn better by watching TV rather than reading books. Whenever I tune on to the History Channel, BBC or National Geographic Channel, I can learn new things. This is also true for the school going children. My younger brother, who is a college student with history major, heavily relies on History Channel documentaries to enhance his knowledge in history. TV programmes are the audio-visual presentation of an event, story or fact and thus have lasting impressions on our brain. If the right programmes are chosen for a child, he/she will learn faster by watching TV. For instance, one of our neighbours allow her 3 years old daughter to watch Rhymes on the internet TV channels and she can recite most of those rhymes. According to her mother, the girl has learned more effectively by watching those animated cartoons that have the rhymes than reading books. Since TV is a powerful learning tool, why not use it in a school for educational purpose?
On the contrary, people who opine that TV programmes are a waste of valuable time has their own reasons. People cannot control the time they spend on watching TV. Moreover, many TV programmes are not suitable for the children and thus can have detrimental effects on their immature mind. They can mimic the bad habits of their favourite heroes and can become violent in many cases. However, this can only happen when we don't have control over our children's' activity. For instance, scientific research shows that a certain amount of chocolate is good for a child's health and cognitive development. However, if a child eats too much chocolate, he will surely suffer from many problems. In the same way, certain hours of TV watching can actually help students learn many things but uncontrolled TV watching habit would actually ruin his life.
In conclusion, as parents and teachers, we must pick the suitable and educational programmes for our kids both in school and at home. My final opinion is that TV is a good pedagogical tool and hence its use in the school for both educational and recreational purposes should be allowed.
Essay 1111:
At present, international tourism is a huge industry and has touched even distant parts of the world. This trend has created some negative consequences and some people are worried that the problems are overwhelming which even outweigh the benefits this industry brings. I am however convinced that international tourism is definitely more beneficial in numerous ways which exceed the disadvantages it brings.
To being with, international tourism creates transcendent benefits on different levels. First and foremost, it provides individuals opportunities to see a different culture first-hand. According to my observation, visiting another country is a comprehensive experience, which is much more enjoyable than staring at another culture on a computer screen. Additionally, international tourism boosts the economy of the host country. Take Macau as an example. International tourism has produced numerous employment opportunities, as high as 66%, in various sectors of this country. Thirdly, knowledge gained during overseas trips certainly helps eliminate a range of stereotypes tourists have about the host country. In this way, individuals can expand their outlook and become worldlier.
Of course, non-biodegradable litter left behind by tourists poses a big threat to the host country. Nonetheless, tourist destinations can certainly establish relevant laws and regulations so that this issue can be addressed. Once the economy of the host country has been enhanced by international tourism, it would be easier for the local government to implement effective strategies to solve this problem.
Essay 1112:
Nowadays, plenty of flora and fauna are demised because of humans’ activities. Nations might be informed why these creatures’ safety are endangered for many decades, but the lack of enough information and a shortage of budget may be the leading reasons why this issue has not been addressed. I personally believe that governments should take responsibility more to solve it.
To begin with, one important reason is that people are not appropriately notified via media. Clearly, the best source of information is news or some documentary programmes shown on television or the Internet; however, unfortunately, their coverage is not sufficient. In particular, billions of fishes died in Persian Gulf Sea during Iran-Iraq war from 1982 to 1989 due to oil spillage, while no organisation became responsible in giving enough data to people. Had citizens of Iran known more about it, more practical implementations would have applied by the related organisations or individuals. Therefore, to solve similar accidents, it is essential that the local media work more closely with the related sectors to inform viewers and find more phenomenal solutions to prohibit such devastating environmental disasters.
Another factor is scarce of the needed funds for having better proactive strategies. Obviously, to raise the safety of wildlife, administrations must spend a remarkable amount of money to protect vegetations or animals. For example, the US government was better to escalate the funds needed for the protection of extinct mammals which were hunted by poachers during last three decades. As a result, international organisations should value more livestock and plants and push state authorities to spend more money on the protection of these creatures.
In conclusion, although nations know about the extinction of live creatures, more actions are needed. From my perspective, each medium must expose more the consequences of this problem to the public than before, and international organisations must be more active to elevate the needed funds for expansion of this protection.
Essay 1122:
We came in this world as an infant with a blank slate in our mind to be filled with various things as we grow older. We receive inputs from the society comprises of peoples such as our parents, siblings, relatives, playmates, friends and our teachers. But our first teachers is our parents and I think they are the best among all the teachers we come across in our life because they are the one we spent most of our time with and they have greater influence in our lives than anyone else.
Learning starts as soon a child appears in his mother’s womb and as per a scientific study evidence was found that most of the neurone connection in human develops even before they come to the world. So undoubtedly parents are first and the most important teachers. They taught us how to eat, how to walk and to summarise how to behave like a human. For example, once I had seen a footage on Discovery channel wherein a four-year girl was found in the custody of dogs who have raised her ever since her parents left her. And a result of this is that she hardly speaks, she used to bark and walk on four legs instead to two. So this proves that what we see is what we learn. Hence parents play a pivotal role in our life acting as the very first tutor of behavioural science.
Yes, there is no doubt that school teachers are the best gift you can get because they bestow you with all the knowledge and experience they have. But characters and personality are built at home and parents are the best teachers because they will always be there for you whenever you feel confused and guide you to the path which is best for you.
Parenting is an art which is mastered by a woman more than a man. A woman is more patient and understanding than a man and so I agree with the opinion that women make good parents than men but I completely disagree with the fact that, the responsibility lies more with the woman in taking care of a child.
In my point of view men and woman share equal rights and responsibilities when it comes to parenting. Woman are better parents than men as they understand their children better than anybody else can because a child spends a major portion of his childhood with his mother and so the mother has a perception on his needs and requirements.
A father though holds equal rights and responsibilities to his child as much as a mother, a father doesn't get enough time to spend with his child. Hence a father wouldn't be able to control his child and make him understand things as much as what a mother could do. It's a scientifically proven fact that a woman upon becoming a mother undergoes huge mental and physical changes. A woman becomes more tolerant patient understanding loving. And this perfectly shapes herself up for parenting and a child who has grown up with his mother respect other women in comparison to children who hasn't.
Though it's a proven point that women make better parents than men the roles and responsibilities of a child are or should be equally shared by both men and woman. Men often mistakenly consider their responsibilities over their child.
Raising children in any society is influenced by their own value and culture. Restlessness traditional world viewer, think and see that the women are the dominant person in taking care of their children. However, in modern society, women and men as an equal to taking their part in raising up the children, as I mention too.
Traditional people exhort the women to take primary responsibility for nursing and educating their children. Women take a crucial role in growing the kids to being an enough older. Meanwhile, the man pays more attentions on fulfilling goods for the family members. Men are one person with superior power in making decision and women is one person with powerless and followed that men decision. She can not involve in voted her voices on taking a decision, otherwise, she only focus on taking care and growing their children.
Furthermore, modern people show that taking a car on their teeny people is older people want to. Both of men and women have the willingness to support the younger person to being a man and women. The men not only giving the authorities to the women as a single fighter to provide kids needed, but he actively involved on nursing their children.
To sum up, take car and guardian the kids not only being as women responsibility, but men also involved actively in younger life development. From my point of view, both of them, men and women have equal responsibility for taking care of raising up their children. Men and women have the same position in making decision on their family in helping their kids to giant better life in the future.
Raising children is a complex task and it is so important to the human being that in some societies, it is considered as the primary responsibility of a family. It is scientifically proven that a child raised under the supervision of both parents is healthier both physically and psychologically. However, there are debates put up by some people opining that women are better at parenting than men. In my view, both parents have an equal role to play in providing care to children. This essay will elaborate both views in detail in few paragraphs below.
To start with, it well established that children are emotionally more attached to a mother than a father. Women could sense problem their child is going through with just the sound of the call they make to call their mother. Many societies believe that certain feelings Mothers get are nothing but the sign by the God about the well-being of their child. For example, in China, if a mother dreams of her child playing in the mud with a pig, it is taken that Child is healthy and safe. Therefore, it is widely believed that mothers have got natural instinct of child care.
However, various studies and research done by scientific fraternity have concluded that Children getting care from both parents turn out to be better human being. This is perhaps due to the fact that the child gets to see two different views on the same problem. Therefore, his/her thinking style broadens. A recent study done by the Psychological society of Mumbai says that children  who had single parents, irrespective of gender, were lagging behind in logical thinking skill compared to those who had both parents. Moreover, study further reveals these children were more prone to influence by bad elements like drugs, crime etc.
Essay 1123:
In these modern days, preparing food has been quite simple, by the advancement of sophisticated cooking utensils and equipment, which in turn has changed the livelihood of people to a great extent. I believe that this change is easily understandable if we look at our daily agenda, as we contribute a lot of time for our profession and other recreational activities.
When we think about being independent, we need to realise that managing time is the greatest challenge we need to face. We all have so many tasks per day, which we need to fit properly into our tight schedules and hence it is very significant that, we are required to minimise the time we need for each activity. Though I agree that, cooking food in a healthy manner is really it is worth to maintain a sound physique, it is very much achievable nowadays, by using equipment like microwave ovens, pressure cookers, induction stoves and high flame gas stoves. The world has become more and more competent, for people to live these days because we need to be more efficient in saving time in order to carry out our job responsibilities and hence the advancement in never cooking methods has a great  effect on it.
Spending time together with family is also very important for the bond between individuals. Being said that, this process of recreation is, for most people; still a dream, as it needs leisure time. The time we could cut down on different daily activities can attribute to this, and cooking is surely one among those. On the other hand, as this trend continues to its maximum, we have been noticing people tend to quit the time for food preparation and instead they depend heavily on fast food restaurants. According to me, this modern day habit is something we need to cease due to its negative effect on our health.
To conclude, I certainly think that, making cuisine is less difficult in this modern era, and it has definitely reduced people's effort and stress; although the increase in the number of restaurants day by day is a question which points towards us, as a real threat to generations coming up.
Essay 1124:
When the world is moving very fast with the new technologies,  new equipment has been introduced to make the life easier. This has been effect in food preparation process also. Hence food is one of the major need, people are willing to enjoy different flavours in easy manner time to time.
As mentioned earlier, new equipment has been introduced and it will lead to saving time when preparing foods. Those days’ traditional methods took several hours to cook foods. Equipment like food processor can use to multiple tasks like blending, chopping, slicing and so on . Therefore preparing foods very easily is not a secret anymore. So the saved time can be used for many other extra activities like studying, entertaining, reading and so on.
Secondly, instant foods have been widely spread among people, specially, university students and employees who are staying away from families. Instead of enjoying outside foods people are willing to prepare foods for them. By reading the given instructions, instant foods can be prepared even without knowing anything. Even though these foods are not much good for health, still it’s far better than restaurants or outdoor foods. So again live has changed and improved.
Children are willing to enjoy a variety of foods. But modern mums are very busy with the fast running world. They don’t have time to try new foods by themselves. But the new lifestyle has been introduced different kinds of foods using the same old recipe with the new taste. Kids will enjoy these homemade foods as its special gift from their loving mums. Therefore interrelation between family members has been improved eventually.
As a conclusion, my thought is while giving priority to healthy wealthy foods people have to prepare them. No matter how far foods have become easier to prepare, if it’s not good for our health ultimate result will not help to improve people's live.
People adapts to the new changes very easily nowadays. In other words, it can be said as moving lifestyle. In these circumstances, people are in a busy working schedule and they cannot manage the old cooking system like smoky wooden stoves. Also, there is no space as well as time to spend on it. As a result of this people go behind the easy cooking recipes or instant food available in the market, even the children opt for burgers or pizza.
Next, the technological advancement plays a major role in the kitchen. Traditional olden days kitchen are getting totally replaced by the modern kitchens and its equipment with all the facilities like mixer grinder, microwave oven, gas stoves etc. With the use of those, preparation of foods is becoming easier and also time saving.
In the future, as a result of new innovations, cooking robots may be introduced to lessen the work more than we think. Definitely, the technological innovation and improvement have made the process of cooking and preparing food easier and that has positively impacted people’s lives. More women now work outside and they can prepare foods after getting back from office. People can spend more time with family members and friends because the cooking needs less time than it used to take. The ready food, improved tools for cooking, easy access to recipes are all beneficial for people as they allow us to spend less time cooking.  
The art of food preparation is perhaps the oldest among all forms of arts and it is still evolving. It has changed a lot since the establishment of human civilisation. And perhaps the biggest change has occurred in modern time. Opinion is divided about the impact of this change on our life, while some say it has made our life easier, others feel that society has lost traditional foods and skills. I feel that modern way of preparing food has positive impacts on human life.
Firstly, in today's time, time is considered a precious commodity. Taking clues from this concept, the cooking method has also changed. Nowadays supermarkets have larger sections of processed and precooked food than the fresh produce. This is because our generation finds that processed foods are time savers. One does not need cut, mix and cook from scratch. People think the saved time can be used in more productive and useful way such as spending more time with family on the dining table while enjoying food than on preparing the food itself. Therefore, with the availability of modern ingredients cooking has become easier and quicker.
On the other hand, recipes are becoming simpler day by day, as no one wants to spend much time in the kitchen. Because of this traditional recipes and methods are getting forgotten. For example, nowadays, rarely anybody prepares 'Pua', a traditional Indian sweet, because of its complex a time-consuming cooking process. Some people also believe that because of readymade ingredients, the originality of taste is lost. Argument is that one would not find the cake prepared from instant-mix as tasty as those prepared by grandmothers at home.
In nutshell, we can fairly conclude that modern way of food preparation is becoming popular day by day because of its simplicity and time saving nature, which in turn has positive impact on our life.
Since the dawn of time, all things developed into more reliable and easier to do fashion including food preparation. For the past years, foods have evolved for us to be conveniently cooked and prepared. It is agreed that foods in easy preparation has improved how every people live. Technological advancement has made the process of food preparation easier. This argument will be proven by looking at how it makes us healthier and connected to our family.
For one, easy food preparation saves time and helps improving our health. For example, Lucky Me and Maggie noodles have a calculated amount of essential elements (e.g. Iron, Calcium and Zinc) and vitamins (e.g. Niacin, Riboflavin and fat-soluble vitamins) that are daily required for our bodies. This makes it clear that these noodles give us the energy and strength we need to do our everyday work. As this shows that modern foods enable us to have a healthy living.
In addition to this, this change makes us more connected to our family. An instance illustrating this in action is that Lucky Me and Maggie noodles require just three minutes to be cooked. Thus, we will be having more time to have fun and help our children's assignments which certainly make them happy. It is obvious from this that it give us a contented living with our loved ones.
The advance cooking devices and kitchen appliance and packet foods are the two blessing for making the cooking process easier. There are many fast food shops that offer instance foods and we nowadays need to spend fewer times on kitchen to prepare and serve foods. This easy process of food preparation is a blessing for us. We already live in an era of tremendous work pressure and the easy food preparation saves a great deal of time for us.
In conclusion, easy-prepared foods make us healthier and allow us to have quality time with our family. It has been proven that this change gives improvement to the way people live. Thus, buying easy-cooked foods are highly recommended.
Essay 1126:
After completing basic school level education, most of the people aspire for colleges/universities for further education. Although everyone seems to have different motive to join colleges but the most tempting one seems to be getting a hefty pay package after leaving the college. But there can be other reasons as well like to interact with people or to deep dive into a subject.
Let’s start with the reason why most people argue to get good marks in your 12th standard. In my city, there are a plethora of colleges but you need to burn the night oil to get into one of the top colleges in north campus. These colleges are not only having a legacy to deliver gold standard students but they also ensure that their students get a job in hand even before finishing their course through campus placements. So students join these colleges to ensure a financially secure future.
But there are others as well for whom these colleges serve deeper insight about a subject they are keen to know about. These colleges offer specialisation in the field of science, commerce and arts which were not there during the school time. Apart from this, college/university offers a completely new experience to all students in terms of interaction with different peoples. College time perceived to be the best part of someone life. Here you meet people who play very important role in your life, for instance, your teachers, friends, role models etc. College life certainly helps a person to transform his life and choose the path in his life he wants to continue.
The reason why I joined a college is quite different from the one discussed above. Even before joining I got myself enrolled for some professional course where a well-defined career is a certainty. So my reason is only to get a graduate degree which could have helped me sometime in future.
Formal education is a well-established method of learning and has been developed to highly mature form with the development of human civilisation. People attend colleges and universities not only to gain a degree or certificate but to attain various other goals. This essay will elaborate few of these reasons in below paragraphs.
Firstly, learning and opportunity for employment are two most popular reasons why anyone goes to university. Deep knowledge on a subject makes a student more employable and suitable for the job. On top of this, colleges also provide venues for placements in their campus itself. For example, 90% of engineering students in India find their job in the recruitment events organised by companies in the college campus during the final semester of the students. Hence, students get doubly benefited by attending universities.
Secondly, some people have an interest in research on topics relating to various aspects effecting human. So they opt for higher education in universities which are well placed with access to government funds allocated to research and inventions. Institutions like ‘Indian Institute of Science’ enroll hundreds of students in the doctorate programs each year and receive thousands of applications for the same. This shows that there is a great deal of interest in research among students these days.
Other most vital reason for people attending universities is that one gets to meet with people of similar interests and a place where he gets newer ideas. There are many examples of entrepreneurs founding big organisations with partners they met in universities and based on innovation ideas which were seeded during their college days.
Most of the people perceive that a tertiary level of education is important. So they attend colleges and universities for certain reasons. It is because enrolling to these institutions will later give them a better and convenient life as well as to make them academically knowledgeable that subsequently use in their future circumstances as will now be analysed.
Firstly, one reason behind why people continue to pursue their education at universities is that this will give them a comfortable life. For instance, I finished my bachelor’s degree in nursing at the University of Baguio in Baguio city, Philippines. Then successfully passed my national exam and has worked in one of the best hospitals in Melbourne, Australia, the Royal Melbourne Hospital. I have had a good paying job and nursing career that made me provide not only my basic needs but also the physiological needs of my family. In fact, I was able to buy my family a Ferrari van that makes their transportation easy and convenient. So this is one of the good reasons why people want to finish the college or university education.
Another reason people go to colleges is they want to become academically knowledgeable that would later be used in their future encounters. For example, while studying nursing at my university, I become a critically-minded individual because I learned to reason out soundly and have made better decisions in my life. I also have known the scientific method of problem-solving which I always use whenever I face inevitable conflicts. Thus, this purpose can be seen also a reason for people to go to colleges and universities.
In conclusion, to have a better and convenient life with own family in the future, and to become academically knowledgeable that would be later used in their future circumstances are two of the many purposes that people think why they go to colleges and universities. There are many different reasons why they do this. So I think that it is always been a good idea to continue and pursue a higher education, so go and enroll to universities.
Essay 1128:
There have been many changes in the way people communicate over the last 20 years. It is understandable that these changes have affected people’s relationship and many new forms of words, abbreviations, grammatical rules and way of writing have emerged, whether this is a good thing or a bad thing should be justified.  
In the past, people used to communicate by writing letters and speaking on the phone. However, technology has changed this, and now emails texts and the internet are the most common communication tools, especially for young people. These methods of technology are much faster than the old ones and these means that people write more quickly and communicate more frequently. Unfortunately, the speed of modern communication system has reduced the accuracy of our messages. This is because people make up their own words and abbreviations and some of these can become quite popular. In my hometown, for example, LOL means’ laugh out loud: and children write this and say it. What is more, punctuation may be missing, and people worry less about how they spell words. Yet language change is not necessarily a bad thing. Informal texts and emails are just messages between friends. It does not matter too much how they are written. The important thing is that people can switch to more accurate language when they need. However, if they lose this ability and formal communication becomes too careless, then there will be problems.
All in all, I do not think you can stop changing, and you cannot prevent new ways of communicating. On the other hand, it is still necessary to make sure that everyone can appreciate and should have an interest in the past because it has made us what we are now.
Essay 1129:
Nowadays, many young people want to live in a big city. They think living in big cities will give them big opportunities to get a better education and job. However, some other people like to live in a small town that is less crowded than big cities.
On the one hand, living in a big city is not a bad idea. In big cities, there are a number of popular schools which has not only good teachers but also good facilities to educate young generation. Furthermore, when children grow up and want to find a job, they have a better chance to get a job they want. For example, if there are two people looking for a job in a company, the employee will consider the one who graduated from a popular school in a big city rather than the other one who graduated from an ordinary school in a small town.
On the other hand, big cities are very crowded and more crimes occur in big cities. In addition, small towns are less polluted than big cities, so people can enjoy the beautiful scenery and the fresh air there. If the children want to get a degree or a job in cities, they can study or work there while living in a small town. For instance, if I want to work in a big city, I can work there on weekdays and enjoy my weekend at my home in a small town.
Considering where to live is one crucial thing which everybody has to do before occupying any places. Regarding this, the choices between these two may be different. Personally, living in a small town would be more interesting than in a big city. However, both have advantages and drawbacks.
According to a significant expanding in human population and the rapid development of the world in every sector which are causing a noticeable increase in human demands, people tend to live in a big city in order to help them in accessing all the things that they need including education, job facility, business opportunity, networks, or other stuff. As a result, the overwhelming majority of societies are living in the city which is again causing really crowded population in the city. Moreover, an enormous number of vehicles are inevitably increasing the risk of getting accidents and also pollutants such as carbon-dioxide that can contribute to global warming. This air pollution will be really annoying for people. Furthermore, the availability of various things such as money and other goods and the huge number of residence can open more opportunities for criminals.
In contrast, preferring to live in a small town would be more beneficial. Firstly, a limited number of population and more natural places with plenty of trees can ease us to relax and of course, the level of pollutants is not as high as it is in the big cities. Secondly, the risk of getting travel accidents is lower as the number of vehicles is fewer.  Thirdly, a chance to get closer and socialise with other people is more in the small town.
However, regarding the accessibility to the education, important goods, shops, and so forth, moving or balancing the population in cities and small towns can tackle this problem. Nonetheless, people in small towns can purchase any goods from cities and also they can go for better education to the cities.
In summary, although some drawbacks may occur when living in a small town, its advantages outweigh the negative impacts. Therefore, in order to get a better and more relaxing life, I do believe that living in a small town is a key for it.

Essay 1130:
Perhaps no subject in the world causes as much controversy as fashion does. As human march on the new millennium, there has been a significant growth to pursue fashion. Although it seems to be extremely vital, I firmly side with negative effects of the following fashion.
The first point to note is that without a doubt, trendy products can broaden our knowledge about innovative breakthrough such as novel home appliances or latest cars to facilitate people's lifestyle but, the reality is the opposite. These products are contributed to showing people's status. As we are living in a competitive world, rivalry among families is on the rise and in this way families are willing to illustrate they are wealthy and up to date. Thus, that is why they have an inclination to the emphasis on fashion.
Another justification to indicate downsides of being trendy is entirely wasting time and money. It should be considered that fashions are only available for a short time of a year and they will fade forever. So, spending a great amount of budget on them is completely unrealistic. Meanwhile, recently, youngsters are more likely to be fashion persuasive which might be due to peer pressure. They are not mature enough to think if these new things are lucrative or not.
In addition, owing to the widespread of advertisement, people are easily cajoled by them and they are encouraged to follow the latest fashion. Therefore, the role of advertisements to create fashion as an essential part of life should be taken into consideration.
Essay 1131:
It is often argued that the government should finance public services instead of spending its budget on arts, music and theatre. Although I agree that the government’s investments in public services play a very important role, I think that proper funding for the arts sector is also crucial for society.
On the one hand, the government should definitely allocate a large part of its budget to public services. This economic sector determines the overall quality of life, ensuring that some basic services, like schools, hospitals and roads, are available to all citizens irrespective of their income or social status. Public services satisfy the primary needs of the society and thus need proper funding, while artists and musicians are not curing diseases or building houses, so their role is secondary. For example, any country can live without music concerts, but the absence of medicine will create significant problems. That is why the government should adequately finance public services in the first place.
On the other hand, arts, music and theatre are not a waste of money, since they are an integral part of society’s cultural and intellectual development and amusement. Firstly, art and music draw people’s attention to diverse phenomena and represent the inward significance of things. Quite often a single drawing, piece or song can exhort myriads of people to reconsider their attitude towards some situations. This way, art serves as a major source of a nation’s personal and intellectual development. Moreover, visiting museums, watching movies and listening to music are common ways of relaxation and entertainment. Thus, the art sector is also important to society and should not be neglected.
To conclude, though I agree that the government should allocate a large part of its budget to such urgent needs of the society like public services, I think that arts, music and theatre should also be financed since they play an important role in people’s development and entertainment.
Essay 1132:
In some countries, the higher tax incomes come from arts such as movie industry, music or theatre business. In this regard, arts are beneficial investments for the government. On the other hand, arts, such as music are the food for soul and government should patronise this sector.  
Moreover, in big countries like America and United kingdom arts are one of the biggest earning sources for those countries. The fact that, many people want to come to these countries because their arts are famous and the best in the world. Due to the fact movie industries, music or theatre has been encouraged the government for tax. Indeed, it can help the government to invest some money to public services as well. Hence, those countries are famous for music and movies and its imposing in the world and have become destiny for many people around the world for gaining their passion in arts.
Undoubtedly, in the United States of America, we can see that musician, an actor or an actress have higher incomes but they should taxable for the government that is  a policy not only in this country but also in some countries that have good arts too. For this reason to develop some areas, for instance, healthcare, public transportation, etc. The government should encourage the artists and arts. Clearly, to give excellent service for American civil society, arts should not be ignored. Furthermore, taxpayers awareness among arts industries are higher and which is rapidly changing the economic growth of America.
Arts are the important media to give profits for the USA whereas in the UK too. Arts represent the identity, uniqueness, heritage and reflection of a nation.  In brief, investing in arts is by means a waste of money, rather it is a good investment both for economic growth and cultural enrichment.
The government spending on arts has long been a contentious issue. Many counter the idea of government incurring expenses to promote arts. However, I feel governments should continue to spend money on arts. This will be argued by analysing how arts can contribute to a country’s economy as well as serve as a platform to achieve one’s goals.
To begin, arts such as music and theatre are steady sources of income for a country. A case in point would be New Zealand, where the government supports new artists by lending them money to kick-start their careers, which in turn enables the state to collect taxes on the revenue earned by these artists. This stream of income would be lost if there’s no spending to foster local artists. Hence it is clear that arts are vital for a country’s economic health rather than being a liability to it.
In addition, having a decent infrastructure for creative industries would mean realisation of dreams of millions who wish to be artists. For instance, in the UK, a person could choose to adopt arts as a career path, enabling him or her to earn a fair livelihood, rather than having to reluctantly pick a profession that he or she does not feel passionate about. A state where the government doesn’t invest in arts would most likely prevent people to go after what they long for, resulting in frustration on the part of people. Therefore arts play an important part in contentedness of the individuals of a nation.
In summary, the government should continue to devote resources to arts since its significance in a country’s tax system and bringing happiness to people should not be underestimated. Henceforth, government’s funding of arts is not a waste of a country’s resources.
Some people are convinced that the financial reserve of the government should be allocated to the public sector rather than on arts. However, I strongly believe that arts play a major role in the development of a country.
Primarily, arts symbolise the culture of a nation. In the primitive era, people celebrated their occasion through music and dance. These cultural activities have become a religious ritual for them, thereby representing an aboriginal tradition. It is in the style of an art such as designs of garments and historic rock sculptures that determine the ethnicity of a group. For example, in the Philippines, the Ifugao tribe in Bulacan is well known for wearing a bahag attire, which looks like an old an old-fangled brief. Their cultural identity becomes famous because of their artistic rice terraces.
Furthermore, arts have become the freedom of expression. Some arts enthusiast can demonstrate their feelings through music or paintings. Such activities have a reasonable means of portraying emotions. One example of this is expressing depression through a composition of a melancholic song rather than to venture in a destructive behaviour such as inebriation of alcohol. Thus, art is a good passion that entices the people to do recreational activities.
Finally, it is widely believed that some artistic outputs have contributed to the tourism of a country. There are holidaymakers who visit a country so they can witness a painting, sculptures or any artistic masterpiece. To illustrate, the painting of Juan Luna “ the Spolarium “ in the Philippines has lured a considerable number of foreign visitors. This is because the painting depicts the suffering of most Filipinos at the time of Spaniard regime, which becomes a historical event in the country.
To conclude, I am convinced that arts have a greater contribution to the society. Not only does it represent the cultural heritage of a country, but it also encourages performing a formidable masterpiece that can promote the culture of a country.
Essay 1133:
The art, music and theatre constitute an integral part of the culture of any country. The government often found supporting these by arranging a requisite amount of funds but for some spending on these activities should ideally be utilised for the welfare of the country’s people as it otherwise does not serve any good purpose. I think there is nothing wrong in supporting arts of a country and government is the ideal body who should do this.
With globalisation, often the culture of developing countries transforms to adopt the traits of developed countries. For example traditional street plays in India are things of past and people are more inclined toward watching movies, a culture from the western countries. This poses a threat to the existence of an intrinsic regional culture of a country which actually defines the spirit and uniqueness of the country. So it is the responsibility of the government to support traditional art, music and theatre which tends to carry the cultural heritage of a country.
Every year a lot is spent by the government to promote regional art, music and theatre and this is something which people suggest is a waste of money. Prima facie it is correct, but on the other hand, it helps promote these features of a country which help the government to attract more and more tourists from other country and it also acts as the livelihood of the people who are solely dependent on these skills. For instance, nation foreign exchange has risen 20%, since the last five years, thanks to the increasing promotion by the government.
Essay 1134:
At present, it’s the gravest problem faced by Pakistan. It shows its ugly head in face of kidnapping, assassination of prominent personalities, bomb blasts, target killing and indiscriminate shooting down of innocent people.
The root causes of escalated terrorism are numerous – illiteracy, poverty, unemployment, wrong interpretations of Islamic concepts like Jihad, and huge inequality and disparity among the society. There are some other sources which state that it’s a repercussion of proxy war in Afghanistan, or it’s supported and funded by foreign agencies to destabilise Pakistan, in order to capture its nukes. Pakistan is a heterogeneous society where sectarianism, religious fanaticism, and intolerance are some other root causes.
Terrorist’s attitude shows that they do not believe in negotiations. So it’s important to tackle them with iron hands because terrorism is destroying our society at every level whether it’s political, social, economic, or psychological. It does not only obstruct economic development but now people are even intimidated into leaving their homes. Overall, society is bearing a high level of fear, stress and insecurity.
It’s difficult to hunt them down as they keep changing their hideouts. But if we want to combat terrorism the government must try to bridge the gulf of disparity among all provinces, promote education and employment and built infrastructure. The government also needs to clearly state its policies to deal with terrorists and anti-terrorism squads and agencies along with society must work together to eradicate this menace. 
Essay 1135:
Nowadays, in many cases, people have to make lots of decisions regarding their career. Some people prefer to work in many places and gain life experiences while others argue that this is not always optimal. Is it really beneficial to be involved in many occupations or is it better to follow your dream path having only the favourite job? In this essay, both advantages and disadvantages of having many jobs will be reviewed and the author's opinion provided.
I will start by analysing the advantages of changing career several times during the lifetime. One of the greatest benefits of having more than one job is that it is easier to earn money. Generally speaking, many students find an occupation so as to be able to become independent from their parents in terms of money. Although they find some trivial jobs, such as being a cleaner, they can become professional specialists after having finished their studies.
Another major positive aspect is that people are able to focus on their main job and additionally do something else after their work which might be more interesting. In my experience, I used to work as a software developer for an enterprise and read lectures at a university. It was beneficial due to fact that I earned enough money and it was exciting to share my knowledge with students.
On the other hand, there are some disadvantages too - one of them being the inability to concentrate on your career goals. For instance, it can be pretty difficult to devote yourself to the work that is the most important to you because either you may not prioritise your jobs or you lack time. Therefore, noteworthy is the fact that it becomes much harder to acquire the required experience.
Another significant drawback of having many jobs is that the life-work balance deteriorates. For example, for many, people feel inferior if they lack qualification in their new occupation. It is quite a frequent situation as it is tough to gain a wide variety of work experience.
In conclusion, the pros and cons of having and switching many jobs were described. In my view, the disadvantages outweigh disadvantages and it is suggested that people should work in many places only if they need money or only temporarily due to other causes.
Essay 1137:
Over the years, buildings of various types have undergone major changes. With the advancement of the technology, the architectural world has reached a level where it has almost no boundaries. What seemed to be near impossible in the past is now a simple task for architectures with the use of advanced technologies. During earlier days only large buildings were designed by architects but in recent times it's a commonly seen trend that professionally trained architects being used for almost every building construction that undertaken.
With a fast paced economy and development of human conditions, people are now very sound financially. And as they grow bigger so is their demands and expectations which grow wider. People nowadays construct buildings of the highest order, not only the one that suits their needs and requirements but also the one which is of the utmost beauty and luxury. And this asks for a different level of expertise and that's where the role of an architect comes in.
In my opinion, buildings constructed these days are all done by highly qualified architects and this is the reason behind the hike in the number of architects. Educational institutions also start focusing on this profession and aim at making the best architectural students.
On the whole, people and companies demand a lot from architects these days and the growing pressure to build the best is proving to be a challenging task to most architects. With technological advancements in the future, buildings will be designed by machines and the architectural world will break furthermore boundaries and challenges.
With growing advancement and technologies, the architectural field has also been escalated nowadays. People are becoming much more advanced and want perfection and luxury. Today, many people get their houses designed by an architect. To some people, this seems needless, while others consider it the important thing for constructing a building. In my opinion, construction should involve a person with expertise to get the best result out of it. Several reasons for this are explained further.
Initially, buildings and houses were made of wood, bamboo sticks and stone to serve the purpose of just providing shelter. Whereas today apart from providing just a roof over our heads, it has many other purposes to serve. Firstly, safety and security are two important reasons to live in a house. Therefore, people today hire an expert to design a house that is safe and sound. High-quality materials are being used to make it durable and long lasting. Secondly, as the population is growing rapidly, there is a need of space for the people to live. A structure designed by an architect can help solving the problem. Buildings using less land can be made to accommodate more people and saving a lot of space. For example, in Japan, people are working on a project to build underground complexes so that less land is consumed and is eco-friendly as well.
To conclude, I believe that without an expertise help all the above-mentioned factors could not be achieved.  Therefore, wise and conservative type of buildings can solely be designed by an architect.
Essay 1139:
The traditional belief that men are breadwinners while women should take care of chores and up bring children is no longer true in the modern era. In many places, this convention has gone to a reverse way and an increasing number of women work outside and men stay at home. There are several reasons for this and I personally think that it is a positive trend.
With the changes in social belief, more parents send their daughters for higher studies instead of preparing them for getting married and this enhances the capable and educated women workforce. In many fields, for example, telemarketing, teaching, fashion design, and banking, women are doing better than men and this has created a demand for female employees in the job market. The equal right movement has had a great impact on empowering women and this has become quite normal for mothers to work at offices while the fathers decide to stay at home to take care of their children. This decision is often based on mutual understanding of the couples and the one who has the higher earning potential decides to work to support the increasing expenses of the family. This has been socially accepted in most of the developed countries though some developing countries in Asia are yet to completely accept this trend.
In my opinion, this trend has more positive outcomes and should be treated as a progress. If both genders do not work for hand in hand and do not get the equal opportunity, the real progress would be impossible. This ensures that we live in an era when both men and women have an equal opportunity and someone is not deprived of a great career or a big opportunity only because of her gender. It is a great chance that allows the parents to decide who to earn money for the family and who to take care of the family, not based on social and traditional belief.
In conclusion, the changing roles in a family have been possible due to the great changes in social belief, advancement of women, especially in education and this is a very positive trend that eliminates the gender discrimination and advocates the equal rights.
Essay 1140:
With the socio-economic development, breadwinner fathers and stay-at-home mothers are on a decline. There are many causes behind this trend and in my opinion, this is could be considered as a positive change rather than negative.
It is undeniable that the global economy is going down. Many men workers have been sacked, and as a consequence, they stay at home, do household chores and take care of children. At the same time, women are more encouraged to work, by the government policies such as maternity leave, high salaries, and shortened the working hours. Another reason why husband role has been changed in recent years is the acceptance of the society for them to become nannies instead of going to work and support the family.
Personally, I think this change in father’s and mother’s traditional role could have many benefits. Firstly, in many cases mothers have a better qualification and job opportunities than their partners, then it seems more sensible them going out to work. Secondly, if fathers stay at home and look after children, it would become an important contribution in their children's upbringing, which could play a vital role in children’s future when they become teenagers and face problems that would be hard for mothers to handle. For example, it is rare to find boys or girls who have a close relationship with their fathers and making troubles or unsuccessful in their lives.
In conclusion, there are different reasons why fathers are becoming more responsible for taking care of children while mothers are busy with the financial support of the family. And I believe this could be useful for the whole family. 
Essay 1141:
It has been seen for decades that male has always been a dominating figure in the society.  Today's world offers equal opportunities to both men and women. Therefore, it is common to see nowadays that more fathers are staying at home and raising children while mothers have become the bread earners. Whatever may be the reasons, I am completely against this trend and to me, it brings more of negativity than positivity.
To start with, one of the causes could be that females today are equally educated and demanding as males. Females have the potential to be independent and walk along with the men in every field. Companies today, seek to hire more females for jobs that are less physically demanding, thereby leaving fewer options for men. Secondly, in some Middle Eastern countries like UAE and Qatar, females are preferred over males, because these countries look for woman empowerment. Finally, in cases where wife holds a higher qualification, she, with mutual understanding and discussion with the husband works so that they can earn more and have a better life.
However, according to me, this brings negative development to the society. Children in their growing age need more love and care, which they can get from by mothers. Females have that natural instinct to provide comfort and care. Fathers, how much ever they try, cannot put the values that a mother can incorporate into a child. Hence, this affects the upbringing of children. Furthermore, fathers cannot cope up with both household tasks and look after the kids. On the other hand, females are said to be multitaskers.
To summarise, I do not want to say that females should not work at all, but of course, not at the cost of nurturing their children. There are women who do part time jobs and look after the family as well. Nevertheless, in my view, this trend should not be continued as it has more drawbacks and brings negativity.
In modern times the traditional gender roles are changing rapidly, resulting in more fathers staying at home looking after their offspring and mothers becoming the main breadwinners in the family. There are numerous causes for this and I think it’s a step in the right direction.
In the past few decades, there have been numerous women’s movements, as a result of which conventional gender roles have gone through a paradigm shift. Although this equality was only acquired after long hard battles fought by women’s right groups against the misogynist practices that existed a few decades ago. Furthermore, in past few decades, we also had a fair share of men’s movements whose main aim was to make men get in touch with their feminine side rather than feel ashamed and disgusted with it.
Nonetheless in many parts of the world and in fact in the minds of many people across the globe, such a family system is considered to be an insult to a man’s masculinity but I beg to differ with this school of thought. In my view, it is a blessing to be living in a time in history where both males and females can choose to take on whatever role they decree. And since it has been proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that women can do most jobs just as good, if not better than their male counterparts there’s nothing wrong with mothers taking on roles that are traditionally thought to be men-oriented.
Nowadays it is common in many families where mothers are breadwinners for the family, while their role is played by the father of upbringing children. A number of factors have led to this situation, I regard it as a positive trend.
On the one hand, in today's society, parents have had to adapt to several changes. Firstly, owing to the advancement of equal rights movements, 21st century's ladies have greater access to educational and professional opportunities which in turn create a situation where women can lead to gain qualifications and pursue a career. Secondly, On the basis of their personalities, to certain kinds of professions such as human resource management, nursing and teaching which are primarily driven by women. For example, in a hospital, more female nurses are recruited due to the fact women tend to more patience and caring to look after patients. Finally, the rising of living which means both marriage partners need to have a job to support the family, therefore, it may depend on the personal preference of each partner, who will take the role of breadwinner and who will take on the role of upbringing children, or based on which partner earns the most money.
On the other hand, in my opinion, this trend could create a profound influence not only in the societies but among the families as well. Having househusband, men can realise the arduous job of his wife that make him more respectable toward her. In addition, it could make harmony and understand between spouses which positively effects on the children as well. Last but not least, there is always a chance to get back to the traditional professions of men and women if they feel bored as seeking a change.
It is clear that the role of mothers to maintain their children has been replaced by fathers in many areas. There are plenty of reasons why this can be and I am pretty sure that it is a good evolution.
For me, mother’s choice to leave her baby to her husband can happen due to various reasons. Firstly, the man might have wider knowledge about how to maintain the baby correctly and effectively than his life partner has. Hence, it is likely to be a wise idea if he obtains the full responsibility to take care of their children. Furthermore, the agreement created before entering marriage life also can be a cause. My sister as an example, before she and her future husband decided to get marriage, they made an appointment that the husband will look after their children as my sister earned much more money than he did. Looking at this example, it seems that economy factor indirectly is one of the reasons. The traditionally settled marriage is declining while people are choosing their life partners. This lead to a phenomenon that women are no longer bound to take care of their children and do household works. If they have better potentials, they do the office jobs or run a business and that leaves the father to stay at home.
In my opinion, it is a positive evolution if the female works and the male stay at home to maintain their children. This is mainly because it is likely to be a distinct proof showing that the position of both genders is same. In addition, it can destroy a traditional assumption revealing that the husband who should earn money for the family and the wife should be a full-time housewife. This issue also reveals that the each couple seemly has different rules in order to create their finest family.
Essay 1142:
The lifestyle of people represents the cultural and traditional norms of a society. The way we socialise, eat, live and behave becomes the trend which is followed by other members of a society. These footprints sometimes result in the destruction of moral values of a community. Recently, it is observed that the number of people preferring to live independently is gradually rising which is alarming as this will have a negative impact on society. This essay will analyse reasons for this and its impact on the society.
Family relations and moral values are the foundations of a reputable society. People opt to live independently because they want to live and lead a free life away from the family restrictions, regulations and norms. They say that their physiology doesn't match with other members of a family and living with them is a mental torture. For instance, children in Asian countries enjoy less freedom than that of West; once they grow up they develop the desire to live alone and autonomous life. Not all of it is associated with the family environment, few people working abroad prefers to live alone or with friends. They believe that this way they can save more and send the same to their families back home. For instance, in UAE, private accommodation cost is more than the average salary of a worker.
Living alone not only affects the person in general but its effects on society are adverse. People living alone suffer from homesickness, they do not want to share their feelings and emotions with others which might result in mental disorders or damage their personality. Their families suffer back home when they need them physically in case of events, gathering or medical emergencies. Children preferring to live alone or with friends are unable to learn the moral lessons or acquire virtuous deeds preached by their parents or guardians. These values are the pillars of a society. Moreover, they don't share the responsibility of the parents, siblings or take part in household stuff which throws the burden on other members of a family.
To recapitulate, the aforementioned provides plausible arguments that highlighted myriad reasons of living independently and its impact on society. People opting to live private and self-governing life often trade their happiness and comfort with the emotions and feelings associated with the combined family system.
Essay 1143:
It is certainly true that there has been a huge change that took place in our ways of living with the time and it is now more developed and convenient than the past. Although I agree with the given statement but I do not agree completely. In my point of view, both of times have their own significances and people are similarly enjoyed and suffered in both eras.
First of all, regarding the past, a century ago people probably had a peaceful life. At that time, the proportion of crimes was significantly low. For example, folks usually lived in their community despite having any fear of burglary, stealing, kidnaping or terrorist attacks, which are the most common incidences at present. Secondly, a century ago, there was no problem of traffic congestions, as there were very negligible numbers of four wheelers running on British roads. Moreover, during that time family bonds were very strong. Such as, there was almost zero incidence of family breakdown while nowadays it is remarked as one kind of tradition.
In the present time, there is an improved lifestyle and this mostly enjoyed by the city people. This is due to the advent of modern technology. For instance, the internet brings people together and makes their work faster where within a millisecond people can send their message to people of another part of the world. To add with, health facilities have developed in such a way that, death ratio is remarkably low in developed countries because saving the life has now become very easy.
To conclude, I believe that, both of the eras bear its importance. In one hand, people are living in a high-tech era, where every single comfort is now in their hand but at the same time, family bonds are loosening gradually. On the other hand, a century ago, people lived a fearless and enjoyable life but without the lights of technological comfort and advent.
Essay 1145:
Many people emigrate from their native countries nowadays. It has been a gradually increasing trend, as plenty of perspective students as well as ordinary workers leave their homelands hoping to become more successful. However, they usually have to separate from families and leave their places of residence. In this essay will be discussed the advantages and disadvantages of living and studying abroad.
To begin with, there are some considerable pros. Firstly, the youth can study in foreign universities in order to become prosperous specialists, which is not a trivial goal to achieve in the native country. For instance, some of the best Lithuanian pupils choose to study at University of Cambridge because it is considered to be one of the top universities in the world in terms of the quality of education. Secondly, adults also migrate abroad if they want to earn more money and to have better career opportunities. For example, the minimum salary in the UK is around 1000 pounds, while in Lithuania it is 300 Euros. Therefore, people can afford to satisfy their needs better living in wealthy foreign countries.
By contrast, there some cons too. To begin with, leaving the homeland usually means damaging relationships with other people. In my personal experience, after my cousins left the country they have not been socialising so much with their parents, although they have kept in touch with them. Additionally, when a person owns a flat or a house, he should continue to pay taxes even if he leaves the place of residence and lives abroad. Thus, noteworthy is the fact that one can miss relatives, and leaving home can be unpleasant sometimes.
In conclusion, it can be seen that something should be sacrificed due to the seeking of a better life. However, it is generally advantageous to take the challenge of living in a foreign country to become a successful person, being it education or work. It is hoped that all countries in the future will be able to provide its citizens equal opportunities to achieve their life goals.
